The purpose of Rails Girls is to give tools for women to understand technology. The Rails Girls events do this by providing a great first experience on building the Internet.

Rails Girls was founded at the end of 2010 in Helsinki. Originally intended as a one-time event, we never thought to see so many chapters from all around the world! This guide will help you get started.

You can use our materials and instructions to roll out your own workshop in your city, workplace or kitchen!

## Overview <a id="8bdf"></a>

This is a Sinatra app, deployed at [http://docs.railsbridge.org](http://docs.railsbridge.org/). The RailsBridge documentation project is home to a few subprojects, including the RailsBridge installfest instructions, which leads students through the various complicated setup instructions for getting Ruby, Rails, Git, etc. installed on their computer \(whatever combination of computer, OS, and version they happened to bring to the workshop!\), as well as the RailsBridge workshop “Suggestotron” curriculum.

Each subproject \(a “site”\) comprises files stored under the “sites” directory; for instance, the installfest instructions are located at ROOT/sites/en/installfest, while the intro rails curriculum can be found under ROOT/sites/en/intro-to-rails. \(The “en” means “English” — see “Locales” below.\)[railsbridge/docsThis is a Sinatra app, deployed at http://docs.railsbridge.org.

> _The purpose of these roadmaps is to give you an idea about the landscape and to guide you if you are confused about what to learn next and not to encourage you to pick what is hip and trendy.

> _These roadmaps cover everything that is there to learn for the paths listed below. Don’t feel overwhelmed, you don’t need to learn it all in the beginning if you are just getting started. We are working on the beginner versions of these and will_ [_release it soon_](https://roadmap.sh/) _after we are done with the 2021 release of the Backend and DevOps roadmaps._

But what is awesome?

Research if the stuff you’re including is actually awesome. Only put stuff on the list that you or another contributor can personally recommend. You should rather leave stuff out than include too much.

Learning how to design scalable systems will help you become a better engineer.

System design is a broad topic. There is a vast amount of resources scattered throughout the web on system design principles.

This repo is an organized collection of resources to help you learn how to build systems at scale.

## Learn from the open source community <a id="d9c5"></a>

This is a continually updated, open source project.

[Contributions](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#contributing) are welcome!

## Prep for the system design interview <a id="3e05"></a>

In addition to coding interviews, system design is a required component of the technical interview process at many tech companies.

Practice common system design interview questions and compare your results with sample solutions: discussions, code, and diagrams.[donnemartin/system-design-primerLearn how to design large-scale systems.

Fluency on the command line is a skill often neglected or considered arcane, but it improves your flexibility and productivity as an engineer in both obvious and subtle ways. This is a selection of notes and tips on using the command-line that we’ve found useful when working on Linux. Some tips are elementary, and some are fairly specific, sophisticated, or obscure. This page is not long, but if you can use and recall all the items here, you know a lot.

This work is the result of [many authors and translators](https://github.com/jlevy/the-art-of-command-line/blob/master/AUTHORS.md). Some of this [originally](http://www.quora.com/What-are-some-lesser-known-but-useful-Unix-commands) [appeared](http://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-useful-Swiss-army-knife-one-liners-on-Unix) on [Quora](http://www.quora.com/What-are-some-time-saving-tips-that-every-Linux-user-should-know), but it has since moved to GitHub, where people more talented than the original author have made numerous improvements. [Please submit a question](https://airtable.com/shrzMhx00YiIVAWJg) if you have a question related to the command line.

This repository serves as a directory of some of the best papers the community can find, bringing together documents scattered across the web.

## free-for.dev <a id="c204"></a>

Developers and Open Source authors now have a massive amount of services offering free tiers, but it can be hard to find them all to make informed decisions.

This is a list of software \(SaaS, PaaS, IaaS, etc.\) and other offerings that have free tiers for developers.

The scope of this particular list is limited to things that infrastructure developers \(System Administrator, DevOps Practitioners, etc.\) are likely to find useful. We love all the free services out there, but it would be good to keep it on topic. It’s a bit of a grey line at times so this is a bit opinionated; do not be offended if I do not accept your contribution.

This list is the result of Pull Requests, reviews, ideas and work done by 900+ people. You too can help by sending [Pull Requests](https://github.com/ripienaar/free-for-dev) to add more services or by remove ones whose offerings have changed or been retired.

_NOTE:_ This list is only for as-a-Service offerings, not for self-hosted software. For a service to be eligible it has to offer a free tier and not just a free trial. If the free tier is time-bucketed it has to be for at least a year. We also consider the free tier from a security perspective, so SSO is fine but I will not accept services that restrict TLS to paid-only tiers.[ripienaar/free-for-devDevelopers and Open Source authors now have a massive amount of services offering free tiers, but it can be hard to…github.com](https://github.com/ripienaar/free-for-dev)

## See how the exact same Medium.com clone \(called [Conduit](https://demo.realworld.io/)\) is built using different [frontends](https://codebase.show/projects/realworld?category=frontend) and [backends](https://codebase.show/projects/realworld?category=backend). Yes, you can mix and match them, because they all adhere to the same [API spec](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld/blob/master/spec) 😮😎 <a id="576c"></a>

While most “todo” demos provide an excellent cursory glance at a framework’s capabilities, they typically don’t convey the knowledge & perspective required to actually build _real_ applications with it.

RealWorld solves this by allowing you to choose any frontend \(React, Angular 2, & more\) and any backend \(Node, Django, & more\) and see how they power a real world, beautifully designed fullstack app called “[Conduit](https://demo.realworld.io/)”.

_Read the_ [_full blog post announcing RealWorld on Medium._](https://medium.com/@ericsimons/introducing-realworld-6016654d36b5)

## Implementations <a id="6348"></a>

Over 100 implementations have been created using various languages, libraries, and frameworks.

[See the list of implementations on the CodebaseShow website &gt;&gt;&gt;](https://codebase.show/projects/realworld)

## Create a new implementation <a id="c04f"></a>

Or you can [view upcoming implementations \(WIPs\)](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld/discussions/categories/wip-implementations).

## How do I get up & running? <a id="a48e"></a>

Follow the instructions in the README of whatever frontend and/or backend repo’s you want to get up and running.

## Can you teach me how to build each stack from scratch? <a id="16da"></a>

Yup! We’ve built step-by-step tutorials for all of our stacks that teach you how to go from `git init` all the way to the production ready application. [Start learning now &gt;&gt;&gt;](https://thinkster.io/tutorials/fullstack)

It is based on Front-End developers’ years of experience, with the additions coming from some other open-source checklists.

## How to use? <a id="266a"></a>

All items in the Front-End Checklist are required for the majority of the projects, but some elements can be omitted or are not essential \(in the case of an administration web app, you may not need RSS feed for example\). We choose to use 3 levels of flexibility:

* means that the item is recommended but can be omitted in some particular situations.
* means that the item is highly recommended and can eventually be omitted in some really particular cases. Some elements, if omitted, can have bad repercussions in terms of performance or SEO.
* means that the item can’t be omitted by any reason. You may cause a dysfunction in your page or have accessibility or SEO issues. The testing priority needs to be on these elements first.

Some resources possess an emoticon to help you understand which type of content / help you may find on the checklist:

* 📖: documentation or article
* 🛠: online tool / testing tool
* 📹: media or video content
