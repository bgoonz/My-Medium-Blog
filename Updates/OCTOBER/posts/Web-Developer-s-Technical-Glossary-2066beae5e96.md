### Update Terms:

**&lt;a&gt; (anchor) tag** — The &lt;a&gt; tag is what defines the beginning and the end of a hypertext link. This is what we use to link from one page to another. Users click on the anchor text to reach the link target. The most important attribute of the &lt;a&gt; element is the href attribute, that’s what indicates the link’s destination. (Without an href attribute, the &lt;a&gt; tag is just a placeholder for a hyperlink.)

**align-items** — In CSS Flexbox, align-items controls the alignment of items on the cross axis: which, by default, is the vertical axis. Align-items is to the vertical (or cross) axis what “justify-content” is to the horizontal (or main) axis — these sub-properties control your axes in Flexbox layout (bear in mind that when the main axis changes the cross axis changes with it). The align-items property accepts 5 different values: flex-start, flex-end, center, baseline, and stretch (default).

**alt** — When you embed an image in your web page, you’ll use this attribute to include alternate text for when the image can’t be displayed (due to a slow connection or an error in the src attribute) or for people who may not be able to see it (the visually impaired use screen readers). For example, &lt;img src=”where the image is” alt=“descriptive text about the image” /&gt;

**Angle brackets** — You’ve noticed that HTML contains little pieces enclosed in angle brackets (&lt; &gt;), though before now you may have known them better as “less-than” and “greater-than” symbols. These angle-bracket-enclosed pieces (called tags) aren’t visible to the user, but rather convey to the browser information about the page’s structure. These brackets let the browser know where our tags start, and where they end.

**App** — Short for application. We have apps on our phones and mobile devices, but our desktops and laptops are full of apps too (though we may just call them applications). Software applications, web applications, mobile applications — all can be called apps.

**Assignment operator (=)** — You may hear developers refer to the equals sign as an “assignment operator.” This just means that they’re using the equals sign to assign a value to something — like an attribute. So by typing, &lt;img src=”where the image is”…&gt; you’re simply assigning the value (the link or path to your image) of the image location, to the src attribute.

**Box model** — In CSS, we use the term “box model” when talking about design and layout. Not to blow your mind or anything, but virtually every element in web design is a rectangular box. The CSS box model is just a box that wraps around every HTML element. (Broadly speaking, CSS has two types of boxes: block boxes and inline boxes).

Understanding these boxes is key to being able to create layouts with CSS or to align items on a page. CSS determines the size, position, and properties (color, background, border size) of these boxes. Every box is composed of four parts (or areas): the content area, padding area, border area, and margin area:

-   <span id="03c2">Content — The content of the box: text and images.</span>
-   <span id="d4be">Padding — Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent.</span>
-   <span id="311c">Border — A border that goes around the padding and content.</span>
-   <span id="8d00">Margin — Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent.</span>

**Browser** — Web browsers (like Google, Firefox, or Safari) are such a ubiquitous part of our modern lives that we may not even stop to think about what they are anymore, but a browser is really just a software application that we use to access the internet (someone just like you has to develop and maintain them).

**Chrome DevTools** — A set of web developer tools built directly into the Google Chrome browser. DevTools allows you to edit web pages and diagnose problems quickly. DevTools also serves as an excellent learning tool for developers in training, making it easy to “look under the hood” and experiment with the functions and mechanics of professional web development. Simply right-click anywhere on a web page and select “Inspect.”

**Closing tag** (or “end tag”) — Closing tags tell the browser that this particular piece of HTML content, this element, is done. You can tell most closing tags by the backslash &lt;/tagname&gt;. Not all tags have closing tags that look like this, and some are self-closing, but this is by far the most common way to encounter them.

**Cloud-hosted** — When people say “the cloud” they really just mean “the internet.” When you hear about something being hosted in the cloud, that means the data or program they’re referring to is stored on internet servers rather than your personal computer’s hard drive (a server is just a computer that serves information to other computers). So cloud hosting means someone else is giving you access to their computing, data, or storage resources via the internet.

**Code** — What even is code? Simply put, code is program instructions that tell a computer what to do. Just as we’ve developed a “code” for understanding each other in life (the English language in this particular case), we’ve also developed code to communicate with computers. Once you learn to the speak the language, you can tell each other almost anything!

**CodePen** — CodePen is an online code editor that lets you test out your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code. As a testing environment (sometimes called a sandbox environment) it’s an excellent learning tool that allows you to see your HTML content render on the screen in real-time: much faster than saving your file and reloading it in the browser every time you make a change.

**Comment &lt;! — → tag** — This tag allows you to leave comments in your HTML that won’t show up for the user. This is useful for planning ahead or leaving yourself reminders/placeholders for where you need to tweak or add content. You can also use it to leave notes to other developers about your code and it’s functionality. (Comments are also great for debugging in HTML because you can “comment out” HTML lines of code one at a time to search for errors.)

**CSS** — (stands for Cascading Style Sheets) is a computer language for laying out and structuring web pages. CSS is the language that tells the computer how to present all that HTML (including colors, layouts, fonts, and instructions for display on different devices). It gives the HTML some personality. Like HTML and JavaScript, it’s a cornerstone of the internet.

**CSS border** — Guess what borders in CSS do? Put borders around your content! (I love it when it means just what you think.) Borders show you where your elements begin and end. The CSS border properties allow you to specify the style, width, color, and radius of an element’s border. The “border” property itself is a shorthand property that incorporates border-width, border-style, and border-color.

**CSS .class selector (.)** — In CSS, a class selector is formatted as a period (.) character followed by the name of the class. It selects all elements with that class attribute so that unique CSS styles can be applied to those specific elements.

**CSS code/rules **— CSS is a different computer language than HTML, so its look and syntax are different. A segment of CSS code is referred to as a CSS rule (similar to how a piece of HTML code is called an HTML element). A CSS rule consists of a selector, and a declaration block. The selector (like “h1”) points to the HTML element you want to style. The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons (see image below). Each declaration includes a CSS property and a value, separated by a colon. Multiple CSS declarations are separated with semicolons, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces. As you’re writing a CSS rule, remember to frame it using three things:

1.  <span id="0170">What HTML element(s) the code applies to — Also known as the selector. This will be the first part your CSS code.</span>
2.  <span id="1880">Curly braces { } — The opening curly brace comes right after you declare the HTML element you want this CSS to apply to. The stuff in these curly braces specifies the style you want that HTML element to have.</span>
3.  <span id="31c0">The code inside the curly braces — which consists of properties and values (each property/value pair makes up a declaration).</span>

**CSS comment (/\* \*/)** — Just like comments in HTML, the browser will not display any comments you leave in your CSS code. In CSS, comments start with /\* and end with \*/. For example, /\* This is a comment \*/ would only be visible to you, not the user. You can add comments wherever you want in the code (for explanatory notes or to “comment out” specific lines of code).

**CSS declarations** — In CSS, a property and value pair is called a declaration. In the example “color: red;” the property is “color” and the value is “red.” The property and value are separated by a colon, and each declaration is closed by a semi-colon. Your CSS will pay attention to which declarations apply to every single element on a page to know how to lay it out and style it correctly.

**CSS display property (display type)** — The display property sets the element’s display type. That is, it defines how the components (like divs, hyperlinks, headings, etc.) are arranged on the web page. Every HTML element has a default display value depending on what type of element it is. The default display value for most elements is block or inline. This property is the most important CSS property for controlling layout because it specifies if and how an element is displayed. Every HTML element is represented by a box that contains something and has space around it. The display property specifies how this box appears on the web page relative to other elements, as well as the behavior of its child elements (the elements inside it).

**CSS margin** — The “white space” around the outside of the box. Margins are used to create space around elements. To help keep them straight, remember that the border is what separates the padding (on the inside of the box) from the margin (which is the space around the outside of the box). You can add margin to specific sides (margin-left, margin-bottom, etc.) or around all four sides with the shorthand property “margin.”

**CSS padding **— The “packing paper” around your content. Padding is the space between an element’s content and its border (padding creates extra space **within** an element, while margin creates extra space **around** an element). While you can add padding to each side of your content individually (padding-top, padding-right, etc.), the CSS shorthand property “padding” lets you set the padding area on all four sides of an element at once.

**CSS properties** — determine which aspect of the selector you want to change (visually). Properties are defined within selectors (see image below). In the video, we saw an example of this property/value pair: “color: red;”. The word “color” is the property. It’s the piece of the declaration that determines which aspect of the selector will be changed visually. You can choose to have as many properties as you like.

**CSS selectors** — A CSS selector is what selects the HTML element(s) you want to style. It’s also the first part of a CSS rule. Writing “h1” before you use your opening curly brace means that you want whatever code follows to apply to the h1 HTML element and to style it accordingly.

**CSS values** — The value is what the chosen CSS property will be changed to. So if the value of a property/value pair is “red,” then it would look like this: “color: red;”. It would change whatever HTML element you selected (with your selector) to the color red. Every time you use a property (like “color”), you must give it a value (in this case “red”) — and certain properties can only accept certain values.

**Curly braces { }** — Also known as “curly brackets” or just “braces,” come right after whatever HTML element you’ve said you want to apply style to. Braces mark the beginning and end of the CSS code that’s specifying your style. You need both an opening curly brace and a closing curly brace to write valid CSS (remember — syntax matters!)

**Deploy** — In programming, deploy means moving a system from the testing phase to the production phase. In development, “production” means — real people are using it to do real work. So deploying a website means doing everything you need to do to make your website available for use — getting it up and running. You know it’s been deployed when it’s been delivered from developers to users.

**Developer** — In our industry, developer is usually short for software developer or web developer, that is, someone who creates software or builds websites. You’ll hear developer used interchangeably with terms like computer programmer, coder, and software engineer, to name a few.

**display: block** — In CSS, this means that the element is displayed as a block, starting on a new line and taking up the whole line (stretching as far to the left and right as it can). Block-level elements span the entire width of the page unless another width is specified; this means that a block will have some whitespace above and below it and won’t allow other HTML elements next to it (except when ordered otherwise — by adding a float declaration to another element, for instance). Some examples of block-level elements include &lt;div&gt;, &lt;p&gt;, &lt;form&gt;, &lt;h1&gt; (or any header), &lt;footer&gt;, and &lt;section&gt;.

**display: flex** — The flex property in CSS is the combination of (or shorthand for) the flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis properties. The flex property is responsive and mobile friendly. “display: flex” is used to set the length of flexible items (if the element is not a flexible item the flex property has no effect) and makes it is easy to position child elements in the main container.

**display: inline** — In CSS, this means the element can be displayed with floating content on its left and right side (a block element fills the entire line — nothing can be displayed on its left or right). Inline elements don’t start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary. They don’t break the flow of content — multiple inline elements can exist on the same line if there’s space. Some examples of inline elements include &lt;span&gt;, &lt;a&gt;, and &lt;img&gt;.

**&lt;div&gt; tag** — A &lt;div&gt; is a generic container. It defines a division or a section (and was one of the only ways to do so before the &lt;section&gt; tag was introduced) which can then be styled with CSS or manipulated with JavaScript. It can help us group or separate out our data — any sort of content can be put inside a &lt;div&gt;. By default, browsers will insert a line break before and after a &lt;div&gt; element. The &lt;div&gt; tag can be useful for styling purposes or as a scripting convenience. (A general rule is that the &lt;section&gt; element is appropriate only if the element’s contents would be listed explicitly in the document’s outline.)

**DRY principle** — The DRY principle (“don’t repeat yourself”) is a development concept aimed at reducing repetition and redundancy in coding patterns. Can you make your code less cumbersome? How often are you copying and pasting chunks of your own code? When you have to update duplicate snippets of code in multiple locations it makes your code much harder to maintain. Duplication bloats your codebase — resulting in more opportunities for bugs and adding unintended complexity to the system. Simpler, cleaner code is easier to reproduce and easier to parse — not just by others, but by future you as well. Clarity should be a constant goal.

**Flexbox** — The Flexible Box Layout Module helps provide a more efficient way to lay out, align, and distribute space among items in a container, even when the size is unknown and/or dynamic (thus the word “flex”). The main idea behind the flex layout is to give the container the ability to alter its items’ width/height (and order) to best fill the available space, mostly to accommodate all kinds of display devices and screen sizes. A flex container expands items to fill available free space or shrinks them to prevent overflow. The flexbox layout is direction-agnostic as opposed to the regular layouts (block which is vertically-based and inline which is horizontally-based). While those work well for pages, they lack flexibility (pun intended) to support large or complex applications (especially when it comes to orientation changing, resizing, stretching, shrinking, etc.).

**Font-family** — The font-family property in CSS specifies the font for an element. You can add multiple font name values for each font-family property — alternatives the browser can use if it doesn’t support your first choice. Because of this, you generally start with the name of the specific font you want, then end with a generic font-family name. Be sure to separate each font value with a comma (font-family: Arial, sans-serif;). There are two types of font family names: a specific family name like “times,” “courier,” or “arial”; and a generic family name like “serif,” “sans-serif,” “cursive,” or “monospace.”

**Gutter** — The grey margin on the left of a code editor (these gutters can also be disabled) that displays line numbers and tags lines of code with different markers. Gutters can also refer to the alleys or spacing between content tracks — the margins, padding, or gaps between content.

**&lt;h1&gt; tag **— This is the tag for the top-level heading in HTML. Guess what the 2nd level heading is? Yup, &lt;h2&gt;. And header 3 would be &lt;h3&gt;, and so on through &lt;h6&gt;. &lt;h1&gt; defines the most important heading — the main heading/subject for the whole page — and &lt;h6&gt; would define the least important heading. You should only use one &lt;h1&gt; per page.

**Hex color codes** — or “hexadecimal colors,” are color values supported in all browsers. A hexadecimal color is specified with: \#RRGGBB. RR (red), GG (green) and BB (blue) are hexadecimal integers between 00 and FF specifying the intensity of the color. For example, \#0000FF is displayed as blue, because the blue component is set to its highest value (FF) and the others are set to 00.

**href (hypertext reference)** — href is an attribute of the &lt;a&gt; (anchor) tag; it’s what specifies your link’s destination. You need it to link to another page. If there’s no href attribute, then it’s not a hyperlink. (It goes inside the opening tag of your &lt;a&gt; element.)

**HTML** — the fundamental building block of every web page and web application on the internet. HTML stands for “hypertext markup language.” So what’s hypertext? And what’s a markup language? Glad you asked. Hypertext is the text displayed on a computer that links you to somewhere else when you click on it (“link” is just short for hyperlink). A “markup language” is a language you use to annotate a document so it displays a certain way on your computer. Unlike a “programming” language, which is used to execute tasks, a markup language is simply designed to format or graphically display your content. Your web browser reads the HTML on a web page to know what information it’s supposed to display and how.

**HTML attribute** — An attribute helps describe an element: provides additional information about it. They’re like special words that control the element’s behavior. You’ll always specify your attributes in your opening tag. Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name=”value” (for example, while the &lt;img&gt; tag is used to embed the image, the src attribute in the &lt;img&gt; element specifies the path to the image — tells us where to find it).

**HTML classes** — Classes are used to group things together. Specifically, grouping elements that you want to apply the same style properties to. The class attribute can be used on any HTML element. The most common use for HTML classes is CSS styling. Create a specific style, assign it to a particular class in HTML, then simply add that class name to any elements you want to inherit that style. Syntax-wise you’d write it like this: &lt;div class=”bigger”&gt;Wash your hands!&lt;/tag&gt;.

**HTML element** — Elements are the building blocks of HTML. An HTML element is simply a start tag, whatever content you have, and an end tag. Everything that falls between the start tag and end tag (including the start tag and end tag) is the element.

**Hypertext** — Hypertext is the text displayed on a computer that links you to somewhere else when you click on it. It’s the text that’s been turned into a link. As you click those links, you’re jumping between “hypertext documents” that are interconnected by “hyperlinks” (link is short for hyperlink).

**&lt;img&gt; tag** — This is the tag you use to add an image to your HTML page. Fun fact, images aren’t technically inserted into a web page — they’re linked to web pages; the &lt;img&gt; tag just creates a sort of holding space for the referenced image. The &lt;img&gt; tag has two required attributes: src — this specifies the path to the image, and alt — this specifies “alternate” text that describes the image, in case the image can’t be displayed for some reason.

**JavaScript** **(JS)** — JavaScript is a programming language used in web development that helps make web pages interactive. Where HTML and CSS are languages that give a web page structure and style, JavaScript gives a web page engaging and dynamic interactive elements. Web pages would be pretty boring if they just sat there displaying static information all the time.

**justify-content **— The CSS justify-content property is a sub-property of the Flexible Box Layout module (flexbox). It defines how the browser distributes space between and around content items along the main-axis of a flex container. It helps distribute extra free space leftover when either all the flex items on a line are inflexible, or are flexible but have reached their maximum size. Flexbox makes it easy to vertically align a box. The justify-content property accepts five different values: flex-start, flex-end, space-between, space-around, and space-evenly.

**margin: auto** — In CSS, “margin: auto” instructs the browser to adjust the horizontal margin automatically based on the viewable area (remember, margins are used to create space around elements). This is often used to center an element.

**Markup language** — A computer language you use to annotate a document so it displays a certain way on your computer. Unlike a programming language, which is used to execute tasks, a markup language is simply designed to format or graphically display your content. Your web browser reads the HTML on a web page to know what information it’s supposed to display and how.

**Nesting **— Nesting is when we put one element inside of another. Nested elements are referred to as “children” and their top-level elements as “parents.” If HTML elements are the boxes that hold your content, then it stands to reason that you could put one box inside of another.

**Normal flow** — Normal flow (or flow layout) is simply the standard way in which elements are positioned on a web browser (before you’ve made changes to the layout with CSS). Generally, the elements are positioned from top to bottom and left to right. The elements in CSS are either block-level elements or inline elements. In the normal flow, block-level elements stack on top of one another and inline elements fill the available space (multiple inline elements can occupy the same line, but each block-level element takes up its own line). When the browsing window is resized, the block elements expand or contract to the new width, and the inline content reflows to fit. Objects in the normal flow influence the position of the surrounding content (sibling elements).

**Opening tag** — (or “start tag”) goes at the beginning of your HTML element. It’s what get’s your element started. The basic structure of an HTML document includes tags, which surround content and apply meaning to it. The opening tag is what kicks things off and tells the browser that everything between this opening point, and the &lt;/html&gt; closing tag, is an HTML element to interpret.

**&lt;p&gt; tag** — The p stands for paragraph. Paragraphs are usually blocks of text, but they can be any group of related content, like images or form fields. When you surround a chunk of content with &lt;p&gt; tags, your browser will automatically add a blank line before and after it to give it a little space from the other stuff — since you said it was its own paragraph.

**Path** — Path just means ‘where a computer searches for a file or a program.’ A “file path” for example could describe the location of a file in a web site’s folder structure. So when we talk about a “source path” for our src attribute in the &lt;img&gt; element, we’re just talking about the “path” the browser takes to get us to the source (the external link).

**Pixels** — A pixel is the smallest unit of a digital image that can be displayed, represented by a dot or square on a monitor/screen. We combine a bunch of pixels to form a complete image, video, text — really any visible thing on a computer display. It’s also known as a picture element (pix = picture, el = element). Pixels are the basic building blocks of a digital image and are created using geometric coordinates. Depending on the graphics card and display monitor, the quantity, size, and color combination of pixels varies and is measured in terms of the display resolution. For example, a computer with a display resolution of 1280 x 768 will produce a maximum of 98,3040 pixels on a display screen.

**Responsive web design (responsive units)** — Responsive web design (RWD) refers to the use of HTML and CSS to ensure your web page looks good on any device. As more diverse screen sizes became available, a set of practices developed to allow web pages to alter their layout and appearance to suit different screen widths, resolutions, etc. (on a phone users might see content in a single column, whereas a tablet might show the same content in two columns). Ideally, your web page should be able to resize, hide, shrink, enlarge, or move content in its layout so it displays well regardless of the device being used to view it — automatically adjusting for everything from device specifications to viewports. Ultimately, it’s about anticipating and responding to the needs of your users.

**&lt;section&gt; tag** — Guess what the &lt;section&gt; tag does? Defines sections! Don’t you love that? The content on your web page may contain chapters, headers, footers, or other sections that could benefit from a more organized &lt;section&gt; tag. In terms of its difference from a &lt;div&gt; tag, &lt;section&gt; means that the content inside is grouped (i.e. relates to a single theme), and would appear as an entry in an outline of the page. &lt;div&gt;, on the other hand, does not convey any meaning in itself.

**Semantic HTML/tags** — Semantic HTML just means HTML whose function or content is obvious by its name. The term “semantic” refers to how we draw meaning from words, so “semantic elements” are elements that clearly describe their meaning to the developer and the browser. &lt;div&gt; and &lt;span&gt; would be examples of “non-semantic elements,” as their names tell us nothing about their content. Whereas, &lt;h1&gt;, &lt;section&gt;, and &lt;form&gt; all make it clear what they’re for, what purpose they serve in the document.

**Serifs** — Serifs are details or small decorative flourishes on the ends of certain strokes that make up letters and symbols. Some notable examples of serif fonts include Georgia, Garamond, Times New Roman, and Baskerville. Sans-serif fonts (like the Arial font) do not have these details or flourishes.

**src (source)** — The src attribute in the &lt;img&gt; element tells us where the image is coming from. Remember, web pages don’t literally contain the images, they link to them. The src attribute specifies the path to the image you’re trying to embed (points you to the external file or resource).

**Syntactic sugar **— Syntactic sugar is syntax in a programming language that makes the code easier to read, express, or understand. Anything that makes it “sweeter”: expressed more clearly, more concisely, or in a preferred style.

**Syntax** — the rules we follow to accurately express ourselves in a language. Unlike human language (which we often still understand despite poor syntax) computer languages require precisely accurate syntax in order to understand. If we don’t write our code according to the rules, the computer or browser won’t know how to interpret it.

**Target attribute** — The &lt;a&gt; target attribute specifies WHERE to open the link. Depending on what you tell it to do, it can open your link in the same window, a new window, a new tab, etc. It will look something like this: &lt;a target=”\_blank”&gt; (this particular value will open the link in a new window or tab).

**Typography** — When we talk about typography in CSS, we’re talking about how your text looks on screen. Typography encompasses a lot — and not just which font you use or whether it’s italic or not. It’s also about the space around and between letters, words, and lines, the size difference between blocks of text in relation to one another, even the history behind various font families.

**Unicode** — A computing standard for consistently encoding symbols (used to display any symbol or character). It’s a universal standard that assigns a code to every character and symbol in every language in the world. You can take this unicode, drop it into your HTML, and your browser will render the image. Pretty useful.

**URL** — A URL is just the address of web page. Just like you need an address to find a physical location in the world, you’ll need an address to access a digital location on the internet.

**Viewport** — The viewport is the area of the web page that is viewable to the user. The viewport varies based on a number of things, including the size of the device (it will obviously be smaller on a cellphone than on a computer screen), whether the browser’s in fullscreen mode, whether the user’s zoomed in or not, etc. The viewport is generally the same as the browser window, excluding the UI, menu bar, and anything’s that’s not the web page itself. Simply put, it’s the section of the web page that’s currently visible.

### Algorithm

A specific set of steps for carrying out certain tasks. Algorithms are used extensively in computer programming to arrive at a solution for a specific problem. The process of creating an algorithm involves documenting all the necessary steps needed to arrive at a solution and how to go about each step. A real world example of an algorithm would be a recipe. The collective instructions of a typical recipe (add ingredients, mix, stir, etc.) constitute an algorithm.

In e-mail, a redirect is similar to a forward, the difference being when you redirect an e-mail to someone it will show the original senders e-mail address as well as your e-mail address in parentheses. For example, if you receive an e-mail from <a href="mailto:someone@adomain.com" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">someone@adomain.com</a>, your e-mail address is <a href="mailto:someone@anotherdomain.com" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">someone@anotherdomain.com</a>, and you redirect the e-mail to the e-mail address <a href="mailto:thirdperson@email.com" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">thirdperson@email.com</a>, the sender field will read something like From: <a href="mailto:someone@adomain.com" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">someone@adomain.com</a> (sent by your name).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### CDN

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*7kT2S7lsQbsJUk7Q.png" class="graf-image" /></figure>Content Delivery Network

This is typically a paid service you can use to get great performance for your app. Many CDNs act as caching proxies to your origin server; some require you to upload your assets to them. They give you a URL for each resource in your app. This URL will resolve differently for folks depending on where they’re browsing.

Behind the scenes, the CDN will distribute your content geographically with the goal of end-users being able to fetch your content with the lowest latency possible. For example, if a user is in India, they’d likely get content served from India faster than from the United States.

### CoffeeScript, TypeScript

These are both languages that compile to JavaScript. You’re able to write your code using the syntax they offer and when ready you compile your TypeScript or CoffeeScript into JavaScript.

### LESS, Sass

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Zgup2nchwl-taGZMniA46w.png" class="graf-image" /></figure>Both LESS and Sass are types of CSS preprocessor markup intended to give you much more control over your CSS. During the build process, the LESS or Sass resources compile down to vanilla CSS (which can be executed in a browser).

### Linter, linting, jslint, jshint

A validation tool which checks for common issues in your JavaScript. You’d usually use this in your build process to enforce quality in your codebase. A great example of something to check for: *making sure you’ve always got your semicolons*.

<a href="http://jshint.com/docs/options/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" title="http://jshint.com/docs/options/">An example of some of the options you can configure</a>

### Polyfill

This is a concept that typically means providing JavaScript which tests for features that are missing (prototypes not defined, etc) and “fills” them by providing an implementation.

### Promise

Asynchronous calls typically return a promise (or deferred). This is an object which has a state: it can be given handlers for when it’s fulfilled or rejected.

Ember makes use of these in places like the model hook for a route. Until the promise resolves, Ember is able to put the route into a “loading” state.

### Transpile

When related to JavaScript, this can be part of your build process which “transpiles” (converts) your ES6 syntax JavaScript to JavaScript that is supported by current browsers.

Besides ES6, you’ll see a lot of content about compiling/transpiling CoffeeScript, a short-hand language which can “compile” to JavaScript.

-   <span id="3730">Ember CLI specifically uses <a href="https://babeljs.io/" class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor" title="https://babeljs.io/">Babel</a> via the <a href="https://github.com/babel/ember-cli-babel" class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor" title="https://github.com/babel/ember-cli-babel">ember-cli-babel</a> plugin.</span>

### Shadow DOM

Not to be confused with Virtual DOM. Shadow DOM is still a work in progress, but basically a proposed way to have an “isolated” DOM encapsulated within your app’s DOM.

Creating a re-usable “widget” or control might be a good use-case for this. Browsers implement some of their controls using their own version of a shadow DOM.

-   <span id="0bcb"><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/shadow-dom/" class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor" title="http://www.w3.org/TR/shadow-dom/">W3C Working Draft</a></span>

### Virtual DOM

Not to be confused with Shadow DOM. The concept of a virtual DOM means abstracting your code (or in our case, Ember) away from using the browser’s DOM in favor of a “virtual” DOM that can easily be accessed for read/writes or even serialized.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Adaptive Web Design (AWD)** — encourages the creation of several versions of a  
web page for a specified number of device dimensions. Which template to display  
is determined in the HTTP GET request which recognises the screen size of the  
device. Adaptive Web Design was introduced to deal with mobile browsing when  
most sites were optimised for desktop only. As devices now exist in many sizes  
and dimensions from different mobile brands through tablets to desktops,  
**Responsive Web Design** has become a popular and more flexible alternative.

**Authentication** — the process of verifying that you are who you say you are  
E.g. when you login to your email you use a password to authenticate your  
identity. Other methods for authentication include using an ID card or  
fingerprint/biometric method.

**Authorization** — check that you are authorised (have permission) to perform a  
certain action or to see a given page. E.g. admin users are authorised to create  
new users on the website.

**Declarations** — in JavaScript declarations are `var`, `const` and `let` for  
the creation of variables, constants and lexically scoped variables.

**Closure** — the scope where a variable can be accessed. A function used within another function can access the parent function’s variables since its scope extends to its parent.

In this example, the variable `color` is accessible to the function `displayColor()`.

    function color() {
        var color = 'red';
        function displayColor() {
            alert(color);
        }
        displayColor();
    }

**CSS Box Model** — the concept that in HTML all elements are contained within  
rectangles or boxes. Each box consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the  
actual content.

**Customer relationship management (CRM)** — a CRM system allows businesses to  
manage business relationships and the data and information associated with them.  
E.g. using CRM to track holiday bookings for a holiday bookings site. The CRM  
would have information on the customer and the trip they’re planning/ have  
booked and any staff members or actions that may need taking to progress or  
confirm their booking.

**Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD)** — CRUD refers to the 4 basic  
operations you can perform on data in a relational database application. Create  
a new data entry, read or retrieve existing data from the database, update the  
value of an existing piece of data or delete an existing piece of data.

**Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)** — is a specification that allows  
specified resources on a web page to be requested from another domain outside  
the domain from which the first resource was served. E.g. uploading images using  
different domains using Amazon S3. For more about origin policies see  
‘Same-origin Policy’.

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript_syntax#Destructuring_assignment" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor"><strong>Destructuring Assignment</strong></a> -  
the ability to unpack and assign variables when there are multiple parameters.

A way to simply assign the variables and then swap their values.

    let x, y;
    [x, y] = [5, 6];
    // x = 5, y = 6
    [y, x] = [x, y];
    // x = 6, y = 5

To assign values from an object.

    let obj = { 'a': 1, 'b': {'b1': '1.1'}}
    let {a, b, b:{b1}} = obj
    // a = 1, b = {'b1': '1.1'}, b1 = 1.1

There is an extensive list found <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54605286/what-is-destructuring-assignment-and-its-uses" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">here</a> for more examples.

**Domain Name** — the characters/words used to identify a website after `http://` or  
`www.`. The domain name consists of two parts. Take this example:  
`https://dwyl.com`, `dwyl` makes up the **second level domain (SLD)** which is  
then followed by `.com` which what is known as the **top level domain (TLD)** or  
**parent domain**. Other examples of top level domains are: `.org`, `.co.uk`  
`.io`. Domain names are the more memorable and user-friendly representation of a  
website's **IP address**. Domain names are registered under the **Domain Name  
System (DNS)**.

**Domain Name System (DNS)** — a distributed global directory of website domain  
names (and other internet resources). The directory stores already registered  
domain names along with their corresponding IP addresses.

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor"><strong>Hexadecimal</strong></a> — Uses 16 different symbols. “0”-”9" to represent the values 0 to 9 and “A”-”F” (“a”-”f” is acceptable too) to represent the values 10 to 15. It’s common to use  
hexadecimals when working in CSS to assign colors to your elements.

The hexadecimal for dwyl’s logo color is \#4bc0a9 (teal).  
To convert the hexadecimal into RGB values, do the following:

    R = 4b
    G = c0
    B = a9

    Convert the letters to their numerical value.
    b = 11
    c = 12
    a = 10

    Red: 4 * (16^1) + 11 * (16^0) = 75
    Green: 12 * (16^1) + 0 * (16^0) = 192
    Blue: 10 * (16^1) + 9 * (16^0) = 169

Hex: \#4bc0a9 is RGB: 75, 192, 169.

**Hoisting** — Hoisting is JavaScript’s default behaviour of moving `var`  
declarations to the top of the current **scope** when your code is run. What  
this means is that whatever line your write a `var` declaration on e.g. `var x;`,  
when your code is run it will automatically be lifted and read as if it were  
written on the top lines of your current **scope** (to the top of the current  
script or the current function).

This means that you can use `var`'s higher up in the code before the line you've  
declared them on. So this example:

    x = "hello";
    console.log(x)     // logs 'hello'
    var x;            //  declaring `x` which is hoisted as if it were written at the top on compilation

Is read by the computer like this:

    var x;            //  declaring `x` which has been hoisted to the top line on compilation
    x = "hello";
    console.log(x)     // logs 'hello'

**Higher-order Function** — Functions that take other functions as parameters and/or return a function. Some examples of these types of functions are the `map` and `reduce` method used for arrays. They both accept a function to use on the elements in the given array.

    // perform an action twice
    function twice (func, value) {
      return func(func(value));
    }

    // func can be any simple (preferably pure) function:
    function func (value) {
      return value + 3;
    }

    console.log(twice(func, 1)); // 7
    console.log(twice(func, 7)); // 13

Not to be confused with pure functions, <a href="https://github.com/dwyl/learn-redux/issues/40#issuecomment-272489779" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">this comment</a> explains the difference between the variations.

**Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)** — the set of rules for transferring files  
(text, graphic images, sound, video, and other multimedia files) on the World  
Wide Web. When you enter http:// in your address bar in front of the domain, it  
tells the browser to connect over HTTP.

**Initialisation** — defining a variable and providing it with an initial value:  
e.g. `var x = 1;`.

**Internet Protocol (IP) Address** — a unique series of numbers or hexadecimal  
digits used to identify a website.

**Microservices** — the practice of running multiple web/application servers  
simultaneously. It is a widely accepted/used application architecture used in  
most companies. Lambda Functions are an example of a micro Node.js Server.

**Polymorphism** — the ability for an object to take on many forms or types e.g.  
when a parent class is used to refer to a child class object. **Operator  
overloading** is one form of polymorphism. It is not used in Javascript but is a  
feature of C++, Scala, Ruby, Haskell and Rust.

**Progressive Web App (PWA)** — PWAs are traditional websites that are enhanced  
with modern web technologies, allowing them to provide a more app-like  
experience. They offer functionality such as being saved as a tile on your  
mobile home screen, working offline and push notifications. The “progressive”  
part means they’re “progressively enhanced” with newer features, which means  
they’ll also work in older browsers that don’t support the new features. Unlike  
native apps, they don’t have to be updated/listed in the app store although it  
is possible to list them in the app store when this is desired.

<a href="https://www.softwaretestingmaterial.com/regression-testing/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor"><strong>Regression Testing</strong></a> -  
the re-running of existing tests to ensure that new changes/fixes have not  
broken any existing functionality. We should perform regression testing any time  
we modify an application, automated testing is a convenient way to achieve this.

**REPL (READ, EVAL, PRINT, LOOP)** — a REPL is an interactive toplevel or  
language shell. A simple, interactive computer programming environment that  
takes single user inputs (i.e. single expressions), evaluates them, and returns  
the result to the user. They are a handy tool for experimenting with  
functionality outside of the context of a project.

**Responsive Web Design (RWD)** — is designing one version of a web page which  
reorders and resizes content in response to the size of a browser **at any given  
point**, not just predetermined device sizes. This means the design of the site  
is optimised for all screen sizes. See Adaptive Design for another approach to  
designing.

**Same-origin Policy** — Under this security policy implemented by web browsers,  
a document (i.e. like a web page) hosted on server A can only interact with  
other documents that are also on server A. In short, the same-origin policy  
enforces that documents that interact with each other have the same origin.

**Search Engine Optimisation (SEO)** — is the process of improving the visibility  
of a website or web page in unpaid/organic search engine results. There are many  
aspects to SEO and search engines change how it’s calculated over time. It may  
include the use of key words on a page, how often you add/edit content on your  
site, to the way other sites link to you on the web.

**Semantic HTML** — semantic HTML is the use of HTML elements that accurately  
describe what they contain/are being used for E.g. a `<p>` tag indicates that the  
text within it is a paragraph whereas a `<nav>` tag should contain navigation  
content and a `<footer>` should appear at the end of the page.

**Syntactic Sugar** — syntactic sugar refers to syntax in a language that is  
designed to make things easier to read. The syntax makes the language “sweeter”  
to use as things can be expressed more clearly or concisely. Something can be  
considered “syntactic sugar” if it could be removed from the language without  
removing any functionality on what the language can do. For example ternary  
operators in Javascript: `x ? a : b` doesn't require the ternary operator syntax  
it could also be expressed with an `if/else` statement:

    if(x)
     { a }
    else
     { b }

**Technical Debt** — Technical  
debt is the time/cost of “re-working” a feature (or entire app) because corners  
were cut the first time it was built. Think of Technical Debt like a “loan shark”  
for your project, if you take “shortcuts” to implement a feature quickly (e.g:  
by skipping tests) you will pay for it later and usually with “interest”. For  
more detail see: <a href="https://github.com/dwyl/product-owner-guide#what-is-technical-debt" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">https://github.com/dwyl/product-owner-guide#what-is-technical-debt</a>

**Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)** -  
TCP is a protocol which exists to enable the establishment of a connection and  
the exchange of streams of data (multiple  
<a href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/6751/data-packet" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">data packets</a>) between  
one or more computers. TCP guarantees the delivery of data and that packets will  
be delivered in the same order in which they were sent.

**Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) handshake** -  
A TCP handshake or three-way handshake is the first part in a three part process  
for TCP data transfer between a local host/client and a server. The handshake is  
a three-step method that requires both the client and server to exchange SYN and  
ACK (acknowledgment) packets to establish a connection before actual data  
communication begins.
