JavaScript has _6_ data types. Five of those are so called _primitive_ data
types:

-   Boolean
-   Number
-   String
-   Null
-   Undefined

Everything else that is not a value of one of the above types is an

-   Object

As we will see in the following slides, objects belong to different kinds of
"classes" of objects.

<div class="callout secondary">

<i class="fa fa-info-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i> **ES2015**

ES2015 introduces a 6th primitive data type: _[Symbol][]_. Symbols are _unique_
and _immutable_ values.
