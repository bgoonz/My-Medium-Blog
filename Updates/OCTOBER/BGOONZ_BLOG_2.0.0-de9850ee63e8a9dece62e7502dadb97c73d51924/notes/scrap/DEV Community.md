If you are new, and you are coming in here to see this.

I hope this isn't overwhelming to you.

Don't be discourage.

A Full-Stack Developer is more of a very long journey rather than this experience listed out here.

I think it's more about learning the fundamentals of each phase. I think that's what you have also done when started programming. Learning basic fundamentals in any language and applying it in other languages.

That's right. Frameworks will come and go. but the concept stays the same. If the core concept and fundamentals are learnt well then no language or no framework will be hard to understand.

Totally agree. The additional point that I would add is that this list appears as separate concepts, but if you're building a production-ready application, you'll learn 80% of this list within the scope of a single project. I don't think they are meant to be learned in isolation (although sometimes this is necessary).

Suggestion to use microservices is not very good one. This is an expensive step and in most cases organizations are not prepared for them.

i didn't suggest to use microservices. i saw that someone else mentioned it, and i supplied links to tools and ideas that makes microservices easier to achieve. i listed tools relevant to microservices; i did not suggest that one choose microservices over some other SOA or style irrespective to their problem or economic situation

if anything, a more intuitive reading of my post would be: "IF you use microservices, use scale cube and microservice design canvas", not "HEY USE MICROSERVICE NOW"

notice, all I did was mention the word "microservice" and two things. just because someone puts it on the road map doesn't mean it's a suggested path, but that it is a suggestion of an _opportunity_ to take a path.

this discussion is about what _we_ can learn as developers in order to be competitive and knowledgeable given the problem set, regardless of the budget to achieve it. we're not here to figure out one organization's problem _as_ individual developers. microservices is one of many things we're expected to understand and learn. we're not asking "what is the road map if you have budget X for organization Y", we're just asking what the road map is. you're bringing it a lot of other background or contextual information to a discussion that doesn't depend on it

The article is about fullstack roadmap. A person new to programming would only get tripped up with JS's quirks, if they truly want to learn JS and not a framework or library. Python will be better to learn OO, and with that foundation someone can tackle the idiosyncrasies (prototypal inheritance) of JS. I would never wish for my enemy to come into programming with JS as their first language. Better to get an early win with Python or even Java. It's not a race.

No JS = no full stack job. You‚Äôre gonna use Python for front end? Don‚Äôt think so. JS is required like it or not. You can‚Äôt have a roadmap of skills that leaves out the only native language to the front end. No front end frameworks and no big backend languages like Java and C#.  
To each their own. But if you have all the skills listed you‚Äôll never get a full stack job without JavaScript + react and C# / Java.

You seem to be looking for an argument. I never said don't learn JS. It's the order of learning I'm talking about. JS first, in my opinion, will lead people new to programming down a whole lot of hurt. I think you should re-read what I said without your bias. JS is fantastic and crucial, in time, for a new programmer.

> JS first, in my opinion, will lead people new to programming down a whole lot of hurt.

On the other hand, people who start with JavaScript won't try to write JavaScript as if it were another programming language and get frustrated because it doesn't work like their favourite language does. Neither will they learn only one programming paradigm like OOP because it's the only one their language supports and then try to impose it to every other language they learn.

Also, JavaScript is a very nice language to start with because you can very quickly see fancy things happening (like a webpage reacting to user clicks and all that), as opposed to just printing stuff on the console.

I agree. In some ways it‚Äôs a good first language: no install needed, visual feedback, tons of resources etc. but in others it isn‚Äôt: dynamically typed, quirks, prototypal, weird type system etc.

One definitely needs statically typed OOP languages like C# or Java to get the fundamentals down. Too many wannabes hate on statically typed languages because they‚Äôre ‚Äúhard‚Äù.

Either way, if one‚Äôs gonna be a full stack Dev then they have to learn JS, or you‚Äôre by definition not full-stack which is my argument on the whole roadmap.

Excellent list. For the benefit of other folks who may be working in a company that uses different technologies for different groups, I recommend adding some information about Subversion (SVN) under **Version Control**. I was so used to git, but hadn't ever used SVN and it took some time to get out of the Git mindset.

Nice article, thanks :) ... but there is nothing about Frameworks. They are very important. Full-Stack Dev should know Spring Boot (JAVA) and Symfony (PHP) for creating REST APIs and Angular or React for Front End development. There is many topics covered which are less important than frameworks, that needed in work ;-).

I totally get your point, Pawe≈Ç. From the _Employability_ Aspect, it makes a lot of sense to focus on the latest frameworks and libraries. However - as a learning roadmap - the goal of this article may be to focus on teaching you the underlying concepts and principles modern web apps rely on. I think if you got this essential knowledge and understand what goes on "under the hood", it'll be easy for you to pick up new languages & frameworks.

Not only Symfony but Slim is also great for creating simple API, as it names suggests, Slim is lightweight.  
Design patterns such as MVC or ADR which the creator of Slim embraces ( I personally don't like it tho ) could be a plus.

I didn't see much on a major corporate tech stack: Microsoft-backed .NET frameworks, SQL Server, and their server architecture (IIS).

There's also not much on what I consider the nexus point, common ground, equalizer, or uniter of the front and backend dev: the IDE. And to tie it back to MS, IMO, they provide the 2 best IDEs in the business: Visual Studio and VS Code. The IDE is where I spend 80 percent of my time as a full stack developer, along with browsers (using dev tools for troubleshooting and researching the internet--I consider the browser as part of the Integrated Development Environment, at least in practice).

It's not to be an exhaustive list of specifics, I know, but here's my comments on specific categories I saw missing the Microsoft platforms I'm used to learning about/using as a full stack dev, FWIW. (I also live in an Apache /Angular / PHP / MySQL world, and saw more about those stacks on the list, which is fair).

Good list of concepts and technologies to be aware of in some degree as a FSD.

You need to now what's availble, but focus on Front-end or Backend. Unless you use JavaScript, of course. In this case you can be more or less proficient in the client and server tech.

The best is to learn concepts and patterns. The rest are tools that come and go. If you know a programming language, you will figure our any framework or lib written with it. If you know what databases are, what are the core principles, how they work and what they are for (SQL, NoSQL, Graph), you will figure out MySQL, PostgresQL, Mongo, etc.

With this knowledge you will be always uptodate.

Cool list missing the frameworks though like React, Angular and Vue. Also there are much more languages than that some readers might think that you have to learn all of them. When in reality you can specialise with certain technical stacks like React/Node, React/Flask etc... Also you did not mention Python as a language which has more popularity than PHP and Ruby. Choice is good better to cover them all.

For those who are still coming to this post - don't use Rust by Example if you're a beginner. Start with the [Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). Also, keep in mind that Rust is quite hard for beginner developers and there are not much jobs in it right now for juniors.

This this this! I've seen so many "full stack roadmaps" that did exactly what the other roadmap you referenced did, and left me wanting more specifics. What newcomers will benefit most from is hearing from experienced coders which specific resources are most valuable, and how those fit into the bigger pitcture, which this does. Thanks!

I started crying after reading this list. Firstly because I was getting a grip over node and react, juggling with python and Javascript. I always thought for myself, these would be something industries use and would help me make many projects, and also land in a descent job. Guess it would take time for me to do anything in life!

Consider this a lifelong reading list, not a to-do list. Take your time.

It will not "take time" for you "to do anything in life". Every day that you wake up and get out of bed, you're doing something. Brushing your teeth and making your bed is an accomplishment, especially during the times we're living in. Please be kind to yourself.
