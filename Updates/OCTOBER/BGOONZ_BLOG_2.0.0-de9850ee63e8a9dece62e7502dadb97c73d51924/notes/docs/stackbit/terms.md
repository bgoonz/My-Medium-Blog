Gitpod Terms of Service
=======================

The provider of the internet services and other products supplied or provided available at gitpod.io (the **"Website"** and together with the internet services and other products, the **"Service"**) is Gitpod GmbH, Am Germaniahafen 1, 24143 Kiel, Germany, registered at the commercial registry of the district court of Kiel under HRB 22228, represented by the managing directors Sven Efftinge, Moritz Eysholdt, Dr. Jan Köhnlein (**"Gitpod"** or **"we/our"**).

The use of the scope of Services provided by us and used by our registered customers in form of individuals and businesses (each a **"Customer"** or **"you/your"**) is determined by the following general terms of service (**"Terms of Service"** or **"Agreement"**).

These Terms of Service shall apply to all Customers including consumers according to Section 13 of the German Civil Code (BGB) and entrepreneurs according to Section 14 of the German Civil Code (BGB). A consumer is a natural person who places the order for a purpose which cannot be attributed to their commercial or self-employed professional activity (each a **"Consumer"**). An Entrepreneur is a natural or legal person or a partnership with legal capacity who, when concluding a legal transaction, acts in the exercise of his commercial or self-employed professional activity (each an **"Entrepreneur"**).

Any provisions, which are contrary to these Terms of Service, are not part of the contract, unless we explicitly and in writing agree that these provisions shall be valid.

1.  Creating an Account and Conclusion of the Agreement
    ---------------------------------------------------

    It is a prerequisite to use the Service of Gitpod having an existing account of Customer at https://github.com operated by GitHub Inc., 88 Colin P Kelly Jr St, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA or any other third party service as set forth on the Website (**"Existing Account"**).

    You offer to conclude this Agreement when you (i) accept these Terms of Service by checking the box at the Website, (ii) provide the data, which is managed in accordance with our [privacy policy](/privacy), required for opening a Gitpod account in our Existing Account page as described throughout this Agreement; and (iii) declare your intention to create, and create, an account by clicking on the respective button in the Existing Account page. By clicking on the button **"Create my free account"** the Customer submits an offer on the conclusion of the contract about the usage of the Service and agrees to the Agreement and the privacy policy of Gitpod which are valid at the time of registration.

    Notwithstanding anything in the contrary in this Agreement, upon your offer to enter into this Agreement, we may, at our discretion, decide to accept or reject such offer. Unless an explicit declaration of the acceptance is given, our acceptance can be deemed given when Gitpod grants the Service offered under this Agreement.

    There is no legal entitlement for using the services provided by Gitpod. Gitpod has the right to stop or deny any registration without giving any reasons.

    By the time of sign-up the Customer must be at least 18 years old and fully contractually capable. In case of doubt Gitpod is entitled to ask the individual Customer to submit a documentary evidence of age or contractual capability.

    In order to access or amend the data relating to the Gitpod account the Customer shall access or amend such data within the Existing Account.

    During our Services, you remain in control of your Existing Account. Cancelation or termination of our Services has no effect on your Existing Account.

    After successful registration the Customer shall be able to log in for using our Service. A login is only possible via the access data assigned to the Customer by Gitpod (user name and password).

2.  Support and Consulting
    ----------------------

    Usually Gitpod does not offer any integration, support and consulting services as part of the Service. Within its sole discretion Gitpod may offer support via email or in-Service communications as set forth in detail on the Website.

    The Customer’s rights in case of defects of the Service remain unaffected.

3.  Rights of Use and Licenses; Open Source
    ---------------------------------------

    We retain ownership of all intellectual property rights of any kind related to the Website and Service unless explicitly granted to you pursuant to this Agreement.

    Upon successful registration for the Service and payment of Fees (as applicable) Gitpod hereby grants to Customer the worldwide, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, non-transferable right to use the Service for the term and subject to the provisions of this Agreement. Customer accepts such grant of rights.

    The Customer is aware that the Service contains open source components and such components are governed by the respective open source licenses.

4.  Fees and Payment
    ----------------

    Depending on the time of using the Service and subscription plan available on the Website chosen by Customer Gitpod demands from the Customer a fee for using its Service based on **"Gitpod-Hours (GPh)"** which is our internal unit to express amounts, credits and debits of Service use (the **"Fee"**). The description, options and total amount of such Fee shall be based on the current list shown on the Website or as provided to Customer in text form.

    All prices for Customers that are Consumers (Section 13 BGB) do include the statutory VAT. All prices for Customers that are Entrepreneurs (Section 14 BGB) do not include statutory VAT and such Customer as Entrepreneur shall be solely responsible for any applicable taxes and related costs.

    The Customer shall pay the Fee by using the payment methods set forth on the Website without any extra charge if Customer is a consumer (Section 13 BGB). The currently valid prices are displayed before the respective purchase is finalized within the Service. No further costs or fees shall arise for the Customer as Consumer when making a payment.

5.  Availability
    ------------

    Our Services are generally available on the Website. Exceptions are: Back-up processes, system maintenance, system or database repair work, unavailability of the third party service for the Existing Account. We try to keep these disruptions on a low level. Customers’ rights in case of defects remain unaffected.

6.  Liability
    ---------

    We are liable without limitation for

    1.  damages caused deliberately or due to gross negligence by Gitpod;
    2.  damages arising out of death, injury to body or health;
    3.  damages due to a neglect of duty by Gitpod concerning essential contractual rights and obligations, which are absolutely necessary for a proper execution of the contract, and which might endanger the fulfilment of the contractual purpose (material contractual obligations). In that case, however, liability shall be limited to typical and foreseeable damages;
    4.  liability according to the Product Liability Act;
    5.  liability in case of a guarantee (without hereby giving such guarantee).

    Any exemption from liability as well as limitations of liability of Gitpod shall also apply to the legal representatives and assistants of Gitpod.

    No further liability for Gitpod exists. In particular, Gitpod is not liable for a failure or delay in rendering Service to the extent caused by circumstances beyond its reasonable control.

    If Customer is an Entrepreneur the statutory provision shall apply and such Customer shall also be held responsible for all its legal representatives, assistants and any assigned users of the Service according to Section 278 BGB.

7.  Warranty for Material Defects and Guarantees
    --------------------------------------------

    We are liable for material defects according to the valid legal regulations if the Customer is a Consumer. The limitation period begins with access to the Service. In such case the statutory warranty rules apply without restriction.

    If the Customer is an Entrepreneur the following shall apply: The Customer shall check the contractual Service immediately upon receipt for obvious defects and inform us immediately if they are present, otherwise a warranty for these defects is excluded. The same applies if such a defect becomes apparent later. Section 377 of the German Commercial Code (HGB) applies as far as legally permissible. The period for warranty claims is restricted to 12 calendar months from the first appearance of the defect as far as permitted by law. The limitation period begins with access to the Service.

    We are not accountable for defects of Service or defects concerning the rights of Service in case the Service was supplied or provided without payment and the defects have not been left intentionally undisclosed.

    We do not offer any guarantees for our Service without an expressly given confirmation.

8.  Customer's General Obligations

In any of those events, the recipient will in advance and promptly inform the other party about the requirement or respectively the request for disclosure.

16. Terms of Service Changes
    ------------------------

    We may change these Terms of Service as well as related documentation at any time at our sole discretion. We will inform you at least in text form that the Terms of Service as well as related documentation have been modified and give information when such changes become effective. The respective change will take effect when you do not object the new terms and conditions within four (4) weeks after sending the email. In case you object to the modification within the four-week period, we shall be entitled to cancel the contract with immediate effect, without you having any claims against us. If the contractual relationship after the effective objection by you continues, the previous terms and conditions shall remain in force.

17. Miscellaneous
    -------------

    You are not allowed to assign, transfer or delegate these Terms of Service to any person or entity at any time given, except for certain rights as explicitly set forth in these Terms of Service.

    This Agreement is governed by the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany, to the exclusion of the Convention of the United Nations on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods. Any statutory provisions on the limitation of the choice of law as well as the applicability of mandatory laws especially by the state, in which the Customer who is a Consumer has his usual place of residence, shall not be deemed affected. Provided the Customer is a merchant, a legal entity under public law or a special fund under public law and to the extent permitted by and compatible with the law the exclusive jurisdiction and venue shall be the seat of Gitpod.

    These Terms of Service and the documents referred hereto jointly constitute the whole Agreement between the Gitpod and Customer and precede any other agreement, arrangement, proposal or communication. Gitpod does not waive any rights under this Agreement by not exercising or delaying to exercise these rights.

    In case individual provisions in these terms and conditions including this provision are or become invalid, or in case of gaps arising in these terms and conditions, the validity of all other provisions will not be deemed affected thereby. Instead of the ineffective provision or for replenishment of gaps an adequate provision will apply. If the Customer is a Consumer and in case this may constitute an unreasonable hardship for one of the contracting parties the contract shall become ineffective as a whole.

    Transfer of the Agreement to Another Party
    ------------------------------------------

    You agree that we may transfer this Agreement to:

    1.  **Gitpod, Inc.**, a corporation incorporated and validly existing under the laws of the State of Delaware, United States, registered with the Division of Corporations of the State of Delaware under file number 3353320 and with business address at: 1390 Market Street, Suite 200, San Francisco. CA 94102, United States ("**Gitpod, Inc.**"); or
    2.  another third-party designated in our discretion ("**Third-Party**")

    by way of a transfer of contract with discharging effect (Vertragsübernahme mit schuldbefreiender Wirkung) with the effect that Gitpod, Inc. or the Third-Party becomes your new contractual partner in our stead and assumes all our rights and obligations under this Agreement.

    We will notify you of a contemplated transfer of this Agreement and provide you with the identity of your new contractual partner in text form with at least four three weeks' notice prior to the contemplated transfer of this Agreement becoming effective ("**Transfer Notice**").

    In case of a contemplated transfer of this Agreement to a Third-Party you shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement without notice and without any additional cause being required. This termination right must be exercised within six weeks following receipt of the Transfer Notice and must be exercised in text form.

    The above termination right shall not exist in case of a transfer of this Agreement to Gitpod, Inc. Other rights you may have to terminate the Agreement with or without cause shall remain unaffected.
