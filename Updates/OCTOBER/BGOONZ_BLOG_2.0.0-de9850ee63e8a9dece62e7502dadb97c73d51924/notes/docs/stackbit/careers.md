Make software engineering collaborative and joyful again.
---------------------------------------------------------

Developers write software within languages/frameworks, build tools, glue them together to (tool) chains, develop against APIs and communicate and collaborate with our colleagues. All of that should be efficient, joyful and secure.

Yet it is not. Devs constantly struggle with larger codebases, cluttered dependencies, security policies and unnecessary friction in their workflows.

We want to make developers feel again that everything is at their fingertips.

Gitpod was founded because we were frustrated by manually setting up and maintaining dev environments.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We are building Gitpod in the open to easily spin-up fresh dev environments for any task. Those ephemeral environments are fast & powerful, fully automated & initialized. They empower developers to immediately start coding, debugging, and testing their code.

Only then developers are always ready-to-code.

The company was established in 2020 and today over 400,000 devs gitpodified their workflows.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We are greateful to be backed by some of the best venture firms and advisors of the world. We recently announced a 13m funding round.

Come join a quickly growing venture-backed team and work together with incredible humans from four continents 🌍

We are open minded, transparent and curious. We remain students of the game, not masters of the game.

We aim for a frictionless experience when interacting with our product, our company and our brand: no hurdles, no BS, no unnecessary extra steps.

We are fully-distributed. You can work from anywhere and schedule your working hours the way it fits best for you. We make sure you are all set and will treat you well.

We are not as diverse as we would like to be.

Help us to change that and shape Gitpod’s future from anywhere in the world! 🌈 🌍
