    As a rule, we only store your personal data for as long as it is necessary for the execution of the contract or the respective purpose and limit the storage period to an absolutely necessary minimum. Your IP-address and server-log-files (as set forth above) are stored for seven (7) days for security and technical reasons.

    In the case of long-term contractual relationships, such as the use of our Service, these storage periods may vary, but are generally limited to the duration of the contractual relationship or, with regard to the inventory data, to the maximum legal retention periods, e.g. in accordance with the German Commercial Code *(Handelsgesetzbuch, HGB)* and the Tax Code *(Abgabenordnung, AO)*

    Criteria for the storage period include whether the data are still up-to-date, whether the contractual relationship with us still exists, whether an inquiry has already been processed, whether a process has been completed or not, and whether legal retention periods for the personal data concerned are relevant or not.

    ### Data Security

    We have installed technical and organizational measures in order to safeguard our Website and/or Service against loss, destruction, access, changes or the distribution of your data by unauthorized persons.

    The Website and Service is operated through a safe SSL-connection. If an SSL-connection is activated third parties are prevented from reading any data that are transferred by you to us.
