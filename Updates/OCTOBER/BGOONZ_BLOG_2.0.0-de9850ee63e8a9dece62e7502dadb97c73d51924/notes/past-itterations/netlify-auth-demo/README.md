# netlify-auth-demo

Listed are very basic demos for using Netlify's authentication provider service to send a signed request to GitHub's OAuth server and receive an access token in return. Feel free to look at whichever version is most comfortable for you.

-   Example using jQuery ([code](./jQuery-example.html)) ([demo](https://auth-demo.netlify.com/jquery-example))

-   Example using vanilla JavaScript ([code](./vanilla-js-example.html)) ([demo](https://auth-demo.netlify.com/vanilla-js-example))

Full setup instructions can be found in the [Netlify OAuth provider docs](https://www.netlify.com/docs/authentication-providers).
