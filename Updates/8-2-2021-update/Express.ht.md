### Express-Routing

#### **Note:** To read this in a rendered view, open your VS Code Command Palate (using Control+Shift+P on Windows, Command+Shift+P on macOS) 

  

####   

Create an Express application. 

-   <span id="216c">Has a page that shows a list of people</span>
-   <span id="fc00">Has a page that allows you to add a person</span>
-   <span id="b702">Is protected from Cross-Site Request Forgeries</span>

In the **images** directory, you will find

-   <span id="b45d">A screenshot of the person listing page</span>
-   <span id="39bc">A screenshot of the person creation form</span>

The screenshots show you what is expected from a *structure* standpoint. They  
are meant to be guides. The tests will *not* make any assertions about the  
styling of your pages, merely the structure of the pages and the data presented  
on them.

Use the technologies you have used up to this point. They are all installed in  
the **package.json** for your convenience.

-   <span id="e52d">Express.js</span>
-   <span id="ab8b">pg (the library to connect to PostgreSQL), Sequelize, and Sequelize CLI</span>
-   <span id="8b4e">CSURF middleware</span>
-   <span id="b9f8">Pug.js</span>
-   <span id="b4d2">cookie-parser middleware</span>
-   <span id="52f9">body-parser middleware</span>
-   <span id="5536">nodemon (for development purposes)</span>

A **package.json** file already exists with the dependencies. Please run `npm install` to install those before doing your development and running your tests.  
Do not remove any dependencies already listed in the **package.json**.

### Running the application

You can run your application in “dev” mode. The **nodemon** package is installed  
and runnable from `npm run dev`.

### Running the tests

This is “black-box testing”. The tests will *only* use your Express application.  
It will not make connections to the database or directly test your route  
handlers. They will merely make HTTP requests of your Express app and analyze  
the responses.

To ease your development, tests will run against your **development** database  
and *not* the test database.

**You** will be responsible for creating, migrating, and seeding the data in  
your development database.

Run your tests with `npm test`. You can run `npm test test/test-file-name.js`  
to run the tests for a specific part of the assessment.

-   <span id="5f97">Example: To only run the test `01-form-page.js` do,  
    `npm test test/01-form-page.js`</span>

If you get tired of seeing all of the Sequelize failures, you can try running:

    npm test 2> /dev/null

That should redirect the annoying messages into oblivion but leave the  
mocha output available for you to read. This may prevent you from seeing other  
errors, though, so make sure to run it without the `2> /dev/null` if you're  
trying to get a test to pass and need to see error output.

### App Requirements

These are the requirements for the application. Follow them closely. The tests  
will attempt to read data from your rendered HTML.

Read all of the requirements. Determine the data needed to include in your data  
model.

Please use port 8081 for your Express.js server.

### The database

Create a database user with `CREATEDB` priveleges:

-   <span id="96a3">The login username that you must use is “express\_practice\_app”</span>
-   <span id="6e88">The login password that you must use is “EzB5Dxo2dabnQBF8”</span>

Initialize Sequelize in your assessment and use the following configuration in  
your `config/config.json` file:

    {
      "development": {
        "username": "express_practice_app",
        "password": "EzB5Dxo2dabnQBF8",
        "database": "express_practice_development",
        "host": "127.0.0.1",
        "dialect": "postgres",
        "seederStorage": "sequelize",
        "logging": false
      }
    }

Remove `logging: false` if you want to see SQL output in your terminal when  
running tests with `npm test`.

Create the `development` database with those configurations.

For this assessment, the tests will be using your `development` database  
configuration defined in the `config.json` file. **The tests will not be  
testing your database explicitly, but test specs DO rely on you setting up the  
database AND database constraints properly.**

You will need to generate and run the migrations, models, and seeders. There is  
no need to run `npm test` until after doing this.

### The data model

You will need to store “People” data and “HairColor” data.

Generate a model (and migration) for the “HairColor” model with the attributes:

Attribute nameAttribute typeConstraintscolorstringunique, not nullable

-   <span id="cda4">the “color” column will hold values up to 20 characters in length and  
    will not allow `NULL`s</span>

Generate a model (and migration) for the “Person” model with the attributes:

Attribute nameAttribute typeConstraintsfirstNamestringnot nullablelastNamestringnot nullableageintegerbiographytexthairColorIdintegernot nullable, references HairColors

Configure the migration so that:

-   <span id="7b0d">the “firstName” column will hold values up to 50 characters in length and  
    will not allow `NULL`s</span>
-   <span id="c44e">the “lastName” column will hold values up to 50 characters in length and  
    will not allow `NULL`s</span>
-   <span id="e6f2">the “hairColorId” will not allow `NULL`s and references the "HairColors"  
    table</span>

Create a seeder file for `HairColors`:

    { color: "Auburn", createdAt: '2019-04-12', updatedAt: '2019-04-12'},
    { color: "Black", createdAt: '2019-04-12', updatedAt: '2019-04-12' },
    { color: "Blonde", createdAt: '2019-04-12', updatedAt: '2019-04-12' },
    { color: "Brown", createdAt: '2019-04-12', updatedAt: '2019-04-12' },
    { color: "Other", createdAt: '2019-04-12', updatedAt: '2019-04-12' },
    { color: "Red", createdAt: '2019-04-12', updatedAt: '2019-04-12' },
    { color: "White", createdAt: '2019-04-12', updatedAt: '2019-04-12' },

If you set up the seeder correctly, the `HairColors` table should have the  
following pre-defined data in it:

colorAuburnBlackBlondeBrownOtherRedWhite

**NOTE:** All of the data constraints for this assessment can be handled by the  
database with the `allowNull` and `unique` flags in your migrations. You **do  
not** need to use form validations in this project. They are good to have, in  
real applications, but can require too much time for you to integrate them into  
this project. Again, you **do not** need to use a form validator, just use  
database constraints and let the errors turn into 500 status codes by Express.

Make sure to make the appropriate associations.

After you’ve generated your models, migrations, and seeder files, don’t forget  
to migrate and seed your database with the appropriate Sequelize CLI commands.

### Your main file

You must use the **app.js** file to create and configure your Express  
application. You must store the instance of your Express.js application in a  
variable named “app”. That is what is exported at the bottom of the **app.js**  
file.

Set up your CSRF middleware to use cookies.

### The route “GET /new-person”

This page shows a form in which a visitor can add a new person. The form must  
have

-   <span id="4869">a method of “post”</span>
-   <span id="1861">an action of “/new-person”</span>

In the form, you should have these inputs with the provided name:

Field HTML nameField typeConstraintsDefault valuesfirstNamesingle-line textrequiredlastNamesingle-line textrequiredagenumberbiographymulti-line texthairColorIddropdownrequiredOne of the pre-defined hair colors\_csrfhiddenThe value provided by the CSURF middleware

You should also have a submit button.

Please refer to the screenshot below:

### The route “POST /new-person”

The post handler should validate the data from the HTTP request. If everything  
is fine, then it should create a new person and redirect to the route “/”.

Remember, all of the data constraints for this assessment can be handled by the  
database with the `allowNull` and `unique` flags in your migrations. You **do  
not** need to use form validations in this project. They are good to have, in  
real applications, but can require too much time for you to integrate them into  
this project. Again, you **do not** need to use a form validator, just use  
database constraints and let the errors turn into 500 status codes by Express.

If the data does not pass validation, then no new record should be created. It  
is ok to just let Express return an error code of 500 in this case. **Note**:  
you would not do this in a real application.

### The route “GET /”

When someone accesses your application, they should see a list of people that  
are stored in your database. The list should contain:

-   <span id="8be4">The person’s first name</span>
-   <span id="30c2">The person’s last name</span>
-   <span id="c4ee">The person’s age</span>
-   <span id="392d">A short biography</span>
-   <span id="15a9">Their hair color</span>

Please refer to the screenshot below:

To create a table in a Pug.js template, you’ll use something like the following  
code. You probably already know this, but it’s included for your reference.

    table
      thead
        tr
          th Header 1
          th Header 2
      tbody
        each thing in things
          tr
            td= thing.property1
            td= thing.property2

The tests will use a regular expression to determine if each piece of data is  
wrapped with TD tags. For example, to test for the “Auburn”  
value appearing in the HTML of the page, the tests would use the following  
regular expression.

    <td[^>]*>\s*Auburn\s*</td>

The regular expression will ignore any attributes that you put on the table data  
tag as well as any white space around the entry for the data value.

Again, the styling is not important to the tests.
