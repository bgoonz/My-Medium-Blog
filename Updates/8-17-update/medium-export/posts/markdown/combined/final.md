### Random Things to Remember

-   <span id="1e39">Using `()` implictly returns components.</span>
-   <span id="a547">Role of `index.js` is to *render* your application.</span>
-   <span id="c38f">The reference to `root` comes from a div in the body of your public HTML file.</span>
-   <span id="a364">State of a component is simply a regular JS Object.</span>
-   <span id="d64b">Class Components require `render()` method to return JSX.</span>
-   <span id="fa3d">Functional Components directly return JSX.</span>
-   <span id="4928">`Class` is `className` in React.</span>
-   <span id="e51a">When parsing for an integer just chain `Number.parseInt("123")`</span>
-   <span id="2924">Use ternary operator if you want to make a conditional inside a fragment.</span>

<!-- -->

    { x === y ? <div>Naisu</div> : <div>Not Naisu</div>; }

-   <span id="ccda">Purpose of `React.Fragment` is to allow you to create groups of children without adding an extra dom element.</span>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Front-End History

-   <span id="904c">React makes it easier for you to make front-end elements. A front-end timeline</span>
-   <span id="646a">Some noteworthy front end libraries that have been used in the past few years:</span>
-   <span id="febf">2005: Script.aculo.us</span>
-   <span id="d5ae">2005: Dojo</span>
-   <span id="0657">2006: YUI</span>
-   <span id="c1f9">2010: Knockout</span>
-   <span id="e742">2011: AngularJS</span>
-   <span id="ed7b">2012: Elm</span>
-   <span id="06e4">2013: React (Considered the standard front-end library)</span>
-   <span id="4ff0">React manages the creation and updating of DOM nodes in your Web page.</span>
-   <span id="53cd">All it does is dynamically render stuff into your DOM.</span>
-   <span id="c393">What it doesn’t do:</span>
-   <span id="3088">Ajax</span>
-   <span id="54ee">Services</span>
-   <span id="5e4a">Local Storage</span>
-   <span id="a437">Provide a CSS framework</span>
-   <span id="06e5">React is unopinionated</span>
-   <span id="721c">Just contains a few rules for developers to follow, and it just works.</span>
-   <span id="e2c0">JSX : Javascript Extension is a language invented to help write React Applications (looks like a mixture of JS and HTML)</span>
-   <span id="916b">Here is an overview of the difference between rendering out vanilla JS to create elements, and JSX:</span>

<!-- -->

    fetch("https://example.com/api/people")
      .then((response) => response.json())
      .then((people) => {
        const html = "<ul>";
        for (let person of data.people) {
          html += `<li>${person.lastName}, ${person.firstName}</li>`;
        }
        html += "</ul>";
        document.querySelector("#people-list").innerHTML = html;
      });

    function PeopleList(props) {
      return (
        <ul>
          $
          {props.people.map((person) => (
            <li>
              {person.lastName}, {person.firstName}
            </li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      );
    }
    const peopleListElement = document.querySelector("#people-list");
    fetch("https://example.com/api/people")
      .then((response) => response.json())
      .then((people) => {
        const props = { people };
        ReactDOM.render(<PeopleList props={props} />, peopleListElement);
      });

-   <span id="7ea4">This may seem like a lot of code but when you end up building many components, it becomes nice to put each of those functions/classes into their own files to organize your code. Using tools with React</span>
-   <span id="e220">`React DevTools` : New tool in your browser to see ow React is working in the browser</span>
-   <span id="9051">`create-react-app` : Extensible command-line tool to help generate standard React applications.</span>
-   <span id="af96">`Webpack` : In between tool for dealing with the extra build step involved.</span>

-   <span id="eefd">Basically, React is super important to learn and master.</span>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### React Concepts and Features

There are many benefits to using React over just Vanilla JavaScript.

-   <span id="8107">`Modularity`</span>
-   <span id="15ac">To avoid the mess of many event listeners and template strings, React gives you the benefit of a lot of modularity.</span>
-   <span id="c1c5">`Easy to start`</span>
-   <span id="90ce">No specials tools are needed to use Basic React.</span>
-   <span id="9ec9">You can start working directly with `createElement` method in React.</span>
-   <span id="dd3c">`Declarative Programming`</span>
-   <span id="d3e6">React is declarative in nature, utilizing either it’s built-in createElement method or the higher-level language known as JSX.</span>
-   <span id="ba8b">`Reusability`</span>
-   <span id="a3c2">Create elements that can be re-used over and over. One-flow of data</span>
-   <span id="27d2">React apps are built as a combination of parent and child components.</span>
-   <span id="6da8">Parents can have one or more child components, all children have parents.</span>
-   <span id="26d8">Data is never passed from child to the parent.</span>
-   <span id="86be">`Virtual DOM` : React provides a Virtual DOM that acts as an agent between the real DOM and the developer to help debug, maintain, and provide general use.</span>
-   <span id="6747">Due to this usage, React handles web pages much more intelligently; making it one of the speediest Front End Libraries available.</span>

### ES6 Refresher

Exporting one item per file

-   <span id="5538">Use `export default` statement in ES6 to export an item. ES6</span>

<!-- -->

    export default class Wallet {
      // ...
    }
    // sayHello will not be exported
    function sayHello() {
      console.log("Hello!");
    }

CommonJS (Equivalent)

    class Wallet {
      // ...
    }
    // sayHello will not be exported
    function sayHello() {
      console.log("Hello!");
    }
    module.exports = Wallet;

Exporting multiple items per file

-   <span id="9a6e">Use just thw `export` keyword (without default) to export multiple items per file. ES6 (Better to export them individually like this, rather than bunching them all into an object)</span>

<!-- -->

    export class Wallet {
      // ...
    }
    export function sayHello() {
      console.log("Hello!");
    }
    export const sayHi = () => {
      console.log("Hi!");
    };
    class Wallet {
      // ...
    }
    function sayHello() {
      console.log("Hello!");
    }
    const sayHi = () => {
      console.log("Hi!");
    };
    export { Wallet, sayHello, sayHi };

CommonJS (Equivalent)

    class Wallet {
      // ...
    }
    function sayHello() {
      console.log("Hello!");
    }
    const sayHi = () => {
      console.log("Hi!");
    };
    module.exports = {
      Wallet,
      sayHello,
      sayHi,
    };

Importing with ES6 vs CommonJS

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*7EZESKf0XPbncXAY" class="graf-image" /></figure>-   <span id="18b1">Import statements in ES6 modules must always be at the top of the file, because all imports must occur before the rest of the file’s code runs. ES6</span>

<!-- -->

    import { Wallet } from "./wallet";
    import * as fs from "fs";
    const wallet = new Wallet();

CommonJS

    let { Wallet } = require("./wallet");
    const wallet = new Wallet();
    let fs = require("fs");

Unnamed default imports

-   <span id="75e2">You can name unnamed items exported with export default any name when you import them.</span>

<!-- -->

    // exporting
    export default class Wallet {
      // ...
    }
    // importing
    import Money from "wallet.js";
    const wallet = new Money();

-   <span id="5042">Just remember if you use `export` instead of `export default` then your import is already named and cannot be renamed.</span>

<!-- -->

    // exporting
    export class Wallet {
      // ...
    }
    // importing
    import { Wallet } from "wallet.js";
    const wallet = new Wallet();

Aliasing imports

-   <span id="3535">Use as asterisk to import an entire module’s contents.</span>
-   <span id="3f1c">Keep in mind you must use an `as` keyword to refer to it later.</span>

<!-- -->

    // export
    export function sayHello() {
      console.log("Hello!");
    }
    export const sayHi = () => {
      console.log("Hi!");
    };
    //import
    import * as Greetings from "greetings.js";
    Greetings.sayHello(); // Hello!
    Greetings.sayHi(); // Hi!

-   <span id="bfbc">You can also name identically named functions or items from different files.</span>

<!-- -->

    import { Wallet as W1 } from "./wallet1";
    import { Wallet as W2 } from "./wallet2";
    const w1 = new W1();
    const w2 = new W2();

Browser support for ES6 Modules

-   <span id="69b4">ES6 Modules can only be used when a JS file is specified as a module. `<script type="module"               src="./wallet.js"></script>`</span>
-   <span id="4f5c">You can get browser support for ES6 modules by adding module into your script tag.</span>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Notes

### JSX In Depth

-   <span id="2a0d">Remember that JSX is just syntactic sugar for the built in `React.createElement(component, props, ...children)`</span>
-   <span id="1532">React Library must always be in scope from your JSX code.</span>
-   <span id="72b2">Use Dot Notation for JSX Type</span>
-   <span id="0cbc">User-Defined Components Must Be Capitalized `<Foo />` vs `<div>`</span>
-   <span id="553a">Cannot use a general expression as the React element type. (`Incorrect`)</span>

<!-- -->

    function Story(props) {
      // Wrong! JSX type can't be an expression.
        return <components[props.storyType] story={props.story} />;
      };

(`Corrected`)

    function Story(props) {
      // Correct! JSX type can be a capitalized variable.
      const SpecificStory = components[props.storyType];
      return <SpecificStory story={props.story} />;
    }

Props in JSX

-   <span id="e549">Several ways to specify props in JSX.</span>
-   <span id="257d">`Javascript Expressions as Props`</span>

<!-- -->

    <MyComponent foo={1 + 2 + 3 + 4} />

-   <span id="57f8">`String Literals`</span>

<!-- -->

    <MyComponent message="hello world" /> <MyComponent message={'hello world'} /> <MyComponent message="&lt;3" /> <MyComponent message={'❤'} />

-   <span id="48df">`Props Default to “True”`</span>

<!-- -->

    <MyTextBox autocomplete /> <MyTextBox autocomplete={true} />

-   <span id="2072">`Spread Attributes`</span>

<!-- -->

    function App1() { return <Greeting firstName="Ben" lastName="Hector" />; } function App2() { const props = { firstName: "Ben", lastName: "Hector" }; return <Greeting {…props} />; }

Children in JSX

-   <span id="2238">`props.children` : The content between opening and closing tag. JavaScript Expressions as Children</span>

<!-- -->

    function Item(props) {
      return <li>{props.message}</li>;
    }
    function TodoList() {
      const todos = ["finish doc", "submit pr", "nag dan to review"];
      return (
        <ul>
          {todos.map((message) => (
            <Item key={message} message={message} />
          ))}
        </ul>
      );
    }

Functions as Children

-   <span id="bf0a">`props.children` works like any other prop, meaning it can pass any sort of data.</span>

<!-- -->

    // Calls the children callback numTimes to produce a repeated component
    function Repeat(props) {
      let items = [];
      for (let i = 0; i < props.numTimes; i++) {
        items.push(props.children(i));
      }
      return <div>{items}</div>;
    }
    function ListOfTenThings() {
      return (
        <Repeat numTimes={10}>
          {(index) => <div key={index}>This is item {index} in the list</div>}
        </Repeat>
      );
    }

Booleans, Null, and Undefined Are Ignored

-   <span id="7017">`false`, `null`, `undefined`, and `true` are all valid children.</span>
-   <span id="5af2">They will not render.</span>
-   <span id="10dc">You can use these to conditionally render items.</span>

<!-- -->

    <div>
      {showHeader && <Header />}
      <Content />
    </div>

-   <span id="fa28">In this example, the component will only render if `showHeader` evals to True.</span>

<!-- -->

    // Before work-around
    <div>
      {props.messages.length &&
        <MessageList messages={props.messages} />
      }
    </div>
    // After work-around
    <div>
      {props.messages.length > 0 &&
        <MessageList messages={props.messages} />
      }
    </div>

-   <span id="3701">Note that certain falsy values such as zero will still be rendered by React, you can work around this by ensuring situations like the above eval. into a boolean.</span>
-   <span id="9586">In the times you want booleans to be rendered out, simply convert it into a string first.</span>

<!-- -->

    <div>My JavaScript variable is {String(myVariable)}.</div>

### Reconciliation

The Diffing Algorithm

-   <span id="76c4">`Diffing` : When the state of a component changes React creates a new virtual DOM tree.</span>
-   <span id="9a73">Elements of Different Types</span>
-   <span id="d680">Every time the root elements have different types, React tears down the old tree and builds the new tree from scratch.</span>
-   <span id="84a6">DOM Elements Of the Same Type</span>
-   <span id="4b94">When comparing two DOM elements of the same type, React keeps the same underlying DOM node and only updates the changes attributes.</span>

<!-- -->

    <div className=”before” title=”stuff” /> <div className=”after” title=”stuff” />

    <div style={{ color: “red”, fontWeight: “bold” }} /> <div style={{color: ‘green’, fontWeight: ‘bold’}} />

-   <span id="0a0c">Component Elements Of The Same Type</span>
-   <span id="cf3a">When components update, instances will remain the same, so that state maintains across renders.</span>
-   <span id="b8ab">React will only update the props, to match the new element.</span>
-   <span id="82f3">Recursing On Children</span>
-   <span id="4a59">React will iterate both lists of children and generate a mutation whenever there’s a difference.</span>
-   <span id="74a8">This is why we use `keys`.</span>
-   <span id="381c">Makes it easier for React to match children in the original tree with children in the subsequent tree.</span>
-   <span id="f1f5">Tradeoffs</span>
-   <span id="e98a">Important to remember that reconciliation algorithm is an *implementation detail*.</span>
-   <span id="7f57">Re-rendering only to apply the differences following the rules stated in the previous sections.</span>

### Typechecking With PropTypes

-   <span id="0bc0">As your application grows, you can use React’s `typechecking` to catch bugs.</span>
-   <span id="638c">`propTypes` is a special property to run typechecking.</span>
-   <span id="e725">exports range of built in validators to ensure your received data is valid.</span>
-   <span id="f590">propTypes is only checked in development mode.</span>

<!-- -->

    import PropTypes from "prop-types";
    class Greeting extends React.Component {
      render() {
        return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;
      }
    }
    Greeting.propTypes = {
      name: PropTypes.string,
    };

Requiring Single Child

-   <span id="e2db">Use `PropTypes.element` to specify only a single child can be passed to a component as children.</span>

<!-- -->

    import PropTypes from "prop-types";
    class MyComponent extends React.Component {
      render() {
        // This must be exactly one element or it will warn.
        const children = this.props.children;
        return <div>{children}</div>;
      }
    }
    MyComponent.propTypes = {
      children: PropTypes.element.isRequired,
    };

Default Prop Values

-   <span id="7d3d">Use `defaultProps` to assign default values for props.</span>

<!-- -->

    class Greeting extends React.Component {
      render() {
        return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;
      }
    }
    // Specifies the default values for props:
    Greeting.defaultProps = {
      name: "Stranger",
    };
    // Renders "Hello, Stranger":
    ReactDOM.render(<Greeting />, document.getElementById("example"));

    class Greeting extends React.Component {
      static defaultProps = {
        name: 'stranger'
      }
      render() {
        return (
          <div>Hello, {this.props.name}</div>
        )
      }

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Notes

### React Router Introduction

-   <span id="48a7">`React Router` is the answer for rendering different components for different pages.</span>
-   <span id="78b3">A front-end library that allows you to control which components to display using the browser location.</span>
-   <span id="aa2a">`Client-side Routing` Getting started with routing</span>
-   <span id="0940">Install React Router with:</span>
-   <span id="742a">npm install — save react-router-dom@⁵.1.2</span>
-   <span id="f07f">Import `Browser Router` from package.</span>
-   <span id="9e4e">import { BrowserRouter } from “react-router-dom”;</span>
-   <span id="cb01">`BrowserRouter` is the primary component of the router that wraps your route hierarchy.</span>
-   <span id="adfa">Wrap it around components.</span>
-   <span id="0276">Creates a `React Context` that passes routing information down to all its descendant components.</span>
-   <span id="dd45">You can also use `HashRouter`, where it would generate a hash before the endpoint. Creating frontend routes</span>
-   <span id="37c2">React Router helps your app render specific components based on the URL.</span>
-   <span id="54c4">The most common component is `<Route>`</span>
-   <span id="500a">Wrapped around another component, causing the comp. to only render if the a certain URL is matched.</span>
-   <span id="5a94">`Props` : path, component, exact, and \[render\]</span>
-   <span id="9f06">Browser Router can only have a single child component.</span>
-   <span id="6305">The Browser Router wraps all routes within a parent div element.</span>

<!-- -->

    const Root = () => {
      const users = {
        1: { name: "Andrew" },
        2: { name: "Raymond" },
      };
      return (
        <BrowserRouter>
          <div>
            <h1>Hi, I'm Root!</h1>
            <Route exact path="/" component={App} />
            <Route path="/hello" render={() => <h1>Hello!</h1>} />
            <Route path="/users" render={() => <Users users={users} />} />
          </div>
        </BrowserRouter>
      );
    };

-   <span id="c057">component</span>
-   <span id="2dcc">Indicates component to render.</span>
-   <span id="740c">path</span>
-   <span id="3030">Indicates path to render a specific component.</span>
-   <span id="0741">exact</span>
-   <span id="52cb">Tells route to not pattern match and only render a certain route exclusively to it’s associated component.</span>
-   <span id="cb93">render</span>
-   <span id="c702">Optional prop that takes in a function to be called.</span>
-   <span id="594b">Causes extra work for React.</span>
-   <span id="5320">Preferred for inline rendering of simple functional components.</span>
-   <span id="0d3e">Difference between `component` and `render` is that component returns new JSX that be re-mounted, but render returns the JSX that will be mounted only once.</span>
-   <span id="4a08">// This inline rendering will work, but is unnecessarily slow. &lt;Route path=”/hello” component={() =&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Hello!&lt;/h1&gt;} /&gt; // This is the preferred way for inline rendering. &lt;Route path=”/hello” render={() =&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Hello!&lt;/h1&gt;} /&gt;</span>
-   <span id="a2d3">Also useful if you need to pass in specific props to a component.</span>
-   <span id="e09f">// \`users\` to be passed as a prop: const users = { 1: { name: “Andrew” }, 2: { name: “Raymond” }, }; &lt;Route path=”/users” render={() =&gt; &lt;Users users={users} /&gt;} /&gt;;</span>

Route path params

-   <span id="3d09">Your component’s props can hold information about URL’s parameters.</span>
-   <span id="52f3">Will match segments starting at `:` to the next `/`, `?`, `#`.</span>

<!-- -->

    <Route
      path="/users/:userId"
      render={(props) => <Profile users={users} {...props} />}
    />

-   <span id="f2b4">`{...props}` spreads out the router’s props.</span>
-   <span id="1edb">`props.match.params` is used to access the match prop’s parameters.</span>
-   <span id="b6a9">Useful keys on the `match` object:</span>
-   <span id="290f">`isExact` : boolean that tells you whether or not the URL exactly matches the path.</span>
-   <span id="27ea">`url` : the currentURL</span>
-   <span id="b979">`path` : Route path it matched against (w/o wildcards)</span>
-   <span id="6c59">`params` : Matches for the individual wildcard segments.</span>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Navigation

React Router Navigation

-   <span id="a548">`Link`, `NavLink`, `Redirect`, `history` props of React Router are used to help your user navigate routes. Adding links for navigation</span>
-   <span id="643f">Issues on-click navigation event to a route defined in app.</span>
-   <span id="949d">Usage renders an anchor tag with a correctly set `href` attribute.</span>

<!-- -->

    import { BrowserRouter, Route, Link } from "react-router-dom";

-   <span id="b5a5">`Link` takes two properties: `to` and `onClick`.</span>
-   <span id="995b">`to` : route location that points to an absolute path.</span>
-   <span id="978c">`onClick` : clickHandler.</span>
-   <span id="b8c0">`NavLink` works just like `Link` but has a bit of extra functionality.</span>
-   <span id="6334">Adds extra styling, when the path it links to matches the current path.</span>
-   <span id="07b8">As it’s name suggests, it is used to Nav Bars.</span>
-   <span id="8a33">Takes three props:</span>
-   <span id="e501">`activeClassName` : allows you to set a CSS class name for styling. (default set to ‘active’)</span>
-   <span id="81da">`activeStyle` : style object that is applied inline when it’s `to` prop. matches the current URL.</span>
-   <span id="8c71">`exact` prop is a boolean that defaults to false; you can set it to true to apply requirement of an exact URL match.</span>
-   <span id="755b">exact can also be used as a flag instead of a reg. property value.</span>
-   <span id="dd12">benefit of adding this is so that you don’t trigger other matches. Switching between routes</span>
-   <span id="4fb6">`<Switch>` : Component allows you to only render one route even if several match the current URL.</span>
-   <span id="7be7">You may nest as many routes as you wish but only the first match of the current URL will be rendered.</span>
-   <span id="3f8a">Very useful if we want a default component to render if none of our routes match.</span>

<!-- -->

    <Switch>
      <Route path="some/url" component={SomeComponent} />
      <Route path="some/other/url" component={OtherComponent} />
      <Route component={DefaultComponent} />
    </Switch>

-   <span id="b901">`DefaultComponent` will only render if none of the other URLs match up.</span>
-   <span id="21a3">`<Redirect>` : Helps redirect users.</span>
-   <span id="ee88">Only takes a single prop: `to`.</span>

<!-- -->

    <Route
      exact
      path="/"
      render={() => (this.props.currentUser ? <Home /> : <Redirect to="/login" />)}
    />

History

-   <span id="6456">`History` allows you to update the URL programmatically.</span>
-   <span id="bac6">Contains two useful methods:</span>
-   <span id="9b00">`push` : Adds a new URL to the end of the history stack.</span>
-   <span id="d539">`replace` : Replaces the current URL on the history stack, so the back button won’t take you to it.</span>

<!-- -->

    // Pushing a new URL (and adding to the end of history stack):
    const handleClick = () => this.props.history.push("/some/url");
    // Replacing the current URL (won't be tracked in history stack):
    const redirect = () => this.props.history.replace("/some/other/url");

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Nested Routes

Why nested routes?

-   <span id="6403">Create routes that tunnel into main components vs getting rendered on the main page as it’s own thing. What are nested routes?</span>

<!-- -->

    const Profile = (props) => {
      // Custom call to database to fetch a user by a user ID.
      const user = fetchUser(props.match.params.userId);
      const { name, id } = user;
      return (
        <div>
          <h1>Welcome to the profile of {name}!</h1>
          <Link to={`/users/${id}/posts`}>{name}'s Posts</Link>
          <Link to={`/users/${id}/photos`}>{name}'s Photos</Link>
          <Route path="/users/:userId/posts" component={UserPosts} />
          <Route path="/users/:userId/photos" component={UserPhotos} />
        </div>
      );
    };

Alt. version using `props.match`

    // Destructure `match` prop
    const Profile = ({ match: { url, path, params }) => {
      // Custom call to database to fetch a user by a user ID.
      const user = fetchUser(params.userId);
      const { name, id } = user;
      return (
        <div>
          <h1>Welcome to the profile of {name}!</h1>
          <Link to={`${url}/posts`}>{name}'s Posts</Link>
          <Link to={`${url}/photos`}>{name}'s Photos</Link>
          <Route path={`${path}/posts`} component={UserPosts} />
          <Route path={`${path}/photos`} component={UserPhotos} />
        </div>}
      );
    };

-   <span id="03fb">As you can see above, our end URL isn’t even defined until we apply those flexible values in.</span>

-   <span id="d052">`Tree Shaking` : Process of removing unused or dead code from your application before it’s bundled. Configuration or code?</span>
-   <span id="ce13">`Configuration` allows developers to create build tasks by declaring either JSON, XML, or YAML without explicitly writing every step in the process.</span>
-   <span id="16a6">`Coding` or `Scripting` simply requires code. Babel and webpack (yes, that’s intentionally a lowercase ‘w’)</span>

### Notes

### Introduction to React

-   <span id="7224">Simply a nice library that turns data into DOM.</span>
-   <span id="a9de">`Tree Diffing` : Fast comparison and patching of data by comparing the current virtual DOM and new virtual DOM - updating only the pieces that change.</span>
-   <span id="1bbc">`It's just a tree with some fancy diffing`</span>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Create Element

From JavaScript To DOM

-   <span id="cae8">The `React.createElement` function has the following form:</span>

<!-- -->

    React.createElement(type, [props], [...children]);

-   <span id="1688">`Type` : Type of element to create, i.e. a string for an HTML element or a reference to a function or class that is a React component.</span>
-   <span id="3249">`Props` : Object that contains data to render the element.</span>
-   <span id="56ab">`Children` : Children of the elemet, as many as you want. Creating elements</span>
-   <span id="ee64">Our rendering goal:</span>

<!-- -->

    <ul>
      <li class="selected">
        <a href="/pets">Pets</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="/owners">Owners</a>
      </li>
    </ul>

-   <span id="eb8b">There are five tags to create:</span>
-   <span id="ea28">One `ul`</span>
-   <span id="a4ba">Two `li`</span>
-   <span id="de01">Two `a`</span>
-   <span id="90b5">There are certain attributes we want to appear in the DOM for these tags as well:</span>
-   <span id="dab5">Each `li` has a `class` (or `className` in React)</span>
-   <span id="e88e">Both `a` ele’s have `href` attributes</span>
-   <span id="fd8c">Also keep in mind the parent child relationships happening between the tags.</span>
-   <span id="9893">`ul` is the parent of both `li`</span>
-   <span id="eafa">Each `li` has an `a` element as a child</span>
-   <span id="84cc">Each `a` has a `text content` child</span>

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*8ls0PmtREELbf5Wm" class="graf-image" /></figure>React.createElement( “ul”, null, React.createElement( “li”, { className: “selected” }, React.createElement(“a”, { href: “/pets” }, “Pets”) ), React.createElement( “li”, null, React.createElement(“a”, { href: “/owners” }, “Owners”) ) );

Converting to virtual DOM

-   <span id="e7d4">After you set up your `React.createElement`, you use `React.render` to take the value returned from cE and a DOM node to insert into the conversion of the real DOM.</span>

<!-- -->

    // Put the element tree in a variable
    const navList = React.createElement(
      "ul",
      null,
      React.createElement(
        "li",
        { className: "selected" },
        React.createElement("a", { href: "/pets" }, "Pets")
      ),
      React.createElement(
        "li",
        null,
        React.createElement("a", { href: "/owners" }, "Owners")
      )
    );
    // Get a DOM node for React to render to
    const mainElement = document.querySelector("main");
    // Give React the element tree and the target
    ReactDOM.render(navList, mainElement);

-   <span id="2cbc">JS Code =&gt; Virtual DOM =&gt; Real Dom Updates</span>
-   <span id="25d5">If you call React.render a second or multiple times it just checks the existing Virtual DOM and it knows which smaller areas to change. Thinking in Components</span>
-   <span id="fe61">Components are pieces of reusable front-end pieces.</span>
-   <span id="bffa">Components should be Single Responsibility Principle compliant.</span>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Create Element

`React.createElement Demo`

-   <span id="a288">Can import non-local dependencies with `import 'package-link'`</span>

<!-- -->

    const App = () => React.createElement("h1", null, "Hello, Programmers!");
    const target = document.querySelector("main");
    const app = React.createElement(App, null);
    // Give React the element tree and the target
    ReactDOM.render(app, target);

-   <span id="0693">Remember when importing modules from other files you have to denote the file type in the import statement. HTML Original</span>

<!-- -->

    <section class="clue">
      <h1 class="clue__title">Clue$ 268530</h1>
      <div class="clue__question">
          2009: I dreamed a Dream
      </div>
      <div class="clue__category">
          <<unparsed>>
      </div>
      <div class="clue__amount">
          $800
      </div>
    </section>

React Version

    const Clue = () =>
      React.createElement(
        "section",
        { className: "clue" },
        React.createElement("h1", { className: "clue__title" }, "Title"),
        React.createElement("div", { className: "clue__question" }, "?"),
        React.createElement("div", { className: "clue__category" }, "Category"),
        React.createElement("div", { className: "clue__amount" }, "$800")
      );

-   <span id="f587">Because `class` is a reserved keyword in JS, in React we can use `className` to assign a class to an element.</span>
-   <span id="4d51">Remember the data that goes into createElement: element type, data to pass into the element, and then children.</span>
-   <span id="8199">`props` : Properties;</span>
-   <span id="6b53">To handle certain values that are initially undefined, we can use `defaultProps`.</span>

<!-- -->

    Clue.defaultProps = {
      category: {},
    };

-   <span id="4abe">You can change in the devTools Network tab the internet speed to check for values that may be undefined to hangle with defaultProps.</span>
-   <span id="79e3">If we fetch multiple pieces of data, we can render many things by using `map`.</span>
-   <span id="06f2">You need to assign a unique key to each of the clues.</span>
-   <span id="c12e">We need to keep track of them individually so that React can easily refer to a specific one if there is an issue. `clue => { key:clue.id, ...clue }`</span>

<!-- -->

    const App = (props) =>
      React.createElement(
        "h1",
        null,
        props.clues.map((clue) =>
          React.createElement(Clue, { key: clue.id, ...clue })
        )
      );
    export default App;

-   <span id="1dd5">Note: JSX is preferred over React.createElement;</span>

    );
    // JSX Version
    <OwnerDetails owner={props.data.owner} number={props.index + 1}>

### Notes

### Using Custom CRA Templates

Using a Custom Template `npx create-react-app my-app --template @appacademy/simple`

-   <span id="9607">Keep in mind that using `create-react-app` automatically initializes a git repository for you!</span>
-   <span id="f0fe">App Academy custom template for creating a react app.</span>
-   <span id="1b4e">If using the default react create project you can delete the following files:</span>
-   <span id="ef1c">favicon.ico</span>
-   <span id="627b">robots.txt</span>
-   <span id="3b34">logo192.png</span>
-   <span id="9b50">logo512.png</span>
-   <span id="8101">manifest.json</span>
-   <span id="77db">You can also simplify the `html` file into:</span>

<!-- -->

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
      <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8" />
        <title>React App</title>
      </head>
      <body>
        <div id="root"></div>
      </body>
    </html>

Simplifying the src folder

-   <span id="ac69">Remove: App.css App.test.js logo.svg serviceWorker.js setupTests.js</span>
-   <span id="064f">Update the Following Files:</span>

<!-- -->

    // ./src/App.js
    import React from "react";
    function App() {
      return <h1>Hello world!</h1>;
    }
    export default App;
    ``;

    // ./src/index.js
    import React from "react";
    import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
    import "./index.css";
    import App from "./App";
    ReactDOM.render(
      <React.StrictMode>
        <App />
      </React.StrictMode>,
      document.getElementById("root")
    );

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### React Class Components

Class Components

-   <span id="b5e6">You can write React components using ES2015 Classes: Function Component</span>

<!-- -->

    // ./src/Message.js
    import React from "react";
    const Message = (props) => {
      return <div>{props.text}</div>;
    };
    export default Message;

ES2015 Version

    // ./src/Message.js
    import React from "react";
    class Message extends React.Component {
      render() {
        return <div>{this.props.text}</div>;
      }
    }
    export default Message;

-   <span id="ae33">We can access props within a `class component` by using `this.props`</span>
-   <span id="0b60">Keep in mind Class Components are used just like function components.</span>

<!-- -->

    // ./src/index.js
    import React from "react";
    import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
    import Message from "./Message";
    ReactDOM.render(
      <React.StrictMode>
        <Message text="Hello world!" />
      </React.StrictMode>,
      document.getElementById("root")
    );

Setting and accessing props

    class Message extends React.Component {
      constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        // TODO Initialize state, etc.
      }
      render() {
        return <div>{this.props.text}</div>;
      }
    }

-   <span id="cd5a">If we define a constructor method in our Class Component, we have to define the `super` method with `props` passed through it.</span>
-   <span id="8bf7">Side Note: Before React used ES2015 Classes, it used `React.createclass` function, if you ever need to use this antiquated method make sure you install a module called `create-react-class` Stateful components</span>
-   <span id="4b12">One of the major reasons why you would choose to use a Class Component over a Function Component is to add and manage local or internal state to your component.</span>
-   <span id="8e82">Second of the major reasons is to be able to use a Class Component’s lifecycle methods. What is state?</span>
-   <span id="7fab">Props are data that are provided by the consumer or caller of the component.</span>
-   <span id="98f4">Not meant to be changed by a component.</span>
-   <span id="c6a9">State is data that is `internal` to the component.</span>
-   <span id="3e89">Intended to be updated or mutated. When to use state</span>
-   <span id="c03f">*Only Use State when it is absolutely necessary*</span>
-   <span id="204b">If the data never changes, or if it’s needed through an entire application use props instead.</span>
-   <span id="0b53">State is more often used when creating components that retrieve data from APIs or render forms.</span>
-   <span id="1b6b">The general rule of thumb: If a component doesn’t need to use state or lifecyle methods, it should be prioritized as a `function component`.</span>
-   <span id="d708">Functional:Stateless || Class:Stateful Initializing state</span>
-   <span id="e5d5">Use a class constructor method to initialize `this.state` object. // Application Entry Point</span>

<!-- -->

    // ./src/index.js
    import React from 'react'
    import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
    import RandomQuote from './RandomQuote';
    ReactDOM.render(
      <React.StrictMode>
        <RandomQuote />
      </React.StrictMode>
      document.getElementById('root');
    )

// Class Component: RandomQuote

    import React from "react";
    class RandomQuote extends React.Component {
      constructor() {
        super();
        const quotes = [
          "May the Force be with you.",
          "There's no place like home.",
          "I'm the king of the world!",
          "My mama always said life was like a box of chocolates.",
          "I'll be back.",
        ];
        this.state = {
          quotes,
          currentQuoteIndex: this.getRandomInt(quotes.length);
        }
      }
      getRandomInt(max) {
        return Math.floor(Math.random() * Math.floor(max));
      }
      render() {
        return (
          <div>
            <h2>Random Quote</h2>
            <p>{this.state.quotes[this.state.currentQuoteIndex]}</p>
          </div>
        )
      }
    }
    export default RandomQuote;

Updating State

-   <span id="3fdc">Let’s say we want to update our state with a new quote.</span>
-   <span id="eddc">We can set up event listeners in React similarly to how we did them before.</span>
-   <span id="106c">&lt;button type=”button” onClick={this.changeQuote}&gt; Change Quote &lt;/button&gt;</span>
-   <span id="a77a">`onClick` is the event listener.</span>
-   <span id="f406">`{this.changeQuote}` is the event handler method.</span>
-   <span id="7dca">Our Class Component File should now look like this with the new additions:</span>

<!-- -->

    import React from "react";
    class RandomQuote extends React.Component {
      constructor() {
        super();
        const quotes = [
          "May the Force be with you.",
          "There's no place like home.",
          "I'm the king of the world!",
          "My mama always said life was like a box of chocolates.",
          "I'll be back.",
        ];
        this.state = {
          quotes,
          currentQuoteIndex: this.getRandomInt(quotes.length);
        }
      }
      changeQuote = () => {
        const newIndex = this.getRandomInt(this.state.quotes.length);
        // Setting the 'new state' of currentQuoteIndex state property
        // to newly generated random index #.
        this.setState({
          currentQuoteIndex: newIndex;
        })
      }
      getRandomInt(max) {
        return Math.floor(Math.random() * Math.floor(max));
      }
      render() {
        return (
          <div>
            <h2>Random Quote</h2>
            <p>{this.state.quotes[this.state.currentQuoteIndex]}</p>
            <button type="button" onClick={this.changeQuote}>
              Change Quote
            </button>
          </div>
        )
      }
    }
    export default RandomQuote;

Don’t modify state directly

-   <span id="ca27">It is important to `never` modify your state directly!</span>
-   <span id="780d">ALWAYS use `this.setState` method to update state.</span>
-   <span id="1581">This is because when you only use this.state to re-assign, no re-rendering will occur =&gt; leaving our component out of sync. Properly updating state from the previous state</span>
-   <span id="dc5a">In our current example, the way we have `changeQuote` set up leaves us with occasionally producing the same index twice in a row.</span>
-   <span id="0bff">One solution is to design a loop but keep in mind that state updates are handled asynchronously in React (your current value is not guaranteed to be the latest)</span>
-   <span id="39f9">A safe method is to pass an anonymous method to `this.setState` (instead of an object literal) Previous</span>

<!-- -->

    changeQuote = () => {
        const newIndex = this.getRandomInt(this.state.quotes.length);
        this.setState({
          currentQuoteIndex: newIndex;
        })
      }

Passing w/ Anon Method

    changeQuote = () => {
      this.setState((state, props) => {
        const { quotes, currentQuoteIndex } = state;
        let newIndex = -1;
        do {
          newIndex = this.getRandomInt(quote.length);
        } while (newIndex === currentQuoteIndex);
        return {
          currentQuoteIndex: newIndex,
        };
      });
    };

Providing default values for props

-   <span id="7e8c">In our current example, we pass in a static array of predefined quotes in our constructor.</span>
-   <span id="3e8f">The way it is set up right now leaves our list of quotes unchanged after initialization.</span>
-   <span id="add0">We can make quotes more dynamic by replacing our static array with a `props` argument passed into `super`.</span>
-   <span id="53d6">constructor(props) { super(props); }</span>
-   <span id="918a">We can now move our quotes array to our application entry point and pass it in as a prop. // Application Entry Point</span>

<!-- -->

    // ./src/index.js
    import React from 'react'
    import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
    import RandomQuote from './RandomQuote';
    // Re-assign our array here and pass it in as a prop in Render.
    const quotes = [
          "May the Force be with you.",
          "There's no place like home.",
          "I'm the king of the world!",
          "My mama always said life was like a box of chocolates.",
          "I'll be back.",
          "This way I can define more quotes",
        ];
    ReactDOM.render(
      <React.StrictMode>
        <RandomQuote quotes={quotes}/>
      </React.StrictMode>
      document.getElementById('root');
    )

-   <span id="a0bb">One thing to note about this workaround is that the caller of the component *must* set the quotes prop or the component will throw an error =&gt; so use `defaultProps`!</span>

<!-- -->

    // At the bottom of RandomQuote.js...
    RandomQuote.defaultProps = {
      quotes: [
        "May the Force be with you.",
        "There's no place like home.",
        "I'm the king of the world!",
        "My mama always said life was like a box of chocolates.",
        "I'll be back.",
        "This way I can define more quotes",
      ],
    };

-   <span id="c575">A good safety net in case the consumer/caller doesn’t provide a value for the quotes array.</span>
-   <span id="3be6">We can even remove it from our index.js now and an error will not be thrown.</span>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Handling Events

-   <span id="a82e">To add an event listener to an element, just define a method to handle the event and associate that method with the element event you are listening for. Example</span>

<!-- -->

    import React from "react";
    class AlertButton extends React.Component {
      showAlert = () => {
        window.alert("Button Clicked!");
      };
      render() {
        return (
          <button type="button" onClick={this.showAlert}>
            Submit
          </button>
        );
      }
    }

-   <span id="a852">Note that when refering the handler method in onClick we’re not invoking showAlert simply just passing a reference. Preventing default behavior</span>
-   <span id="5cb0">HTML Elements in the browser often have a lot of default behavior.</span>
-   <span id="df4d">I.E. Clicking on an `<a>` element navigates so a resource denoted by `<href>` property.</span>
-   <span id="952c">Here is an example of where using `e.preventDefault()` could come in handy.</span>

<!-- -->

    import React from "react";
    class NoDefaultSubmitForm extends React.Component {
      submitForm = (e) => {
        e.preventDefault();
        window.alert("Handling form submission...");
      };
      render() {
        return (
        <form onSubmit={this.submitForm}>
          <button>Submit</button>
        </form>;
        )}
    }

-   <span id="b149">The button contained within the form will end up refreshing the page before `this.submitForm` method can be completed.</span>
-   <span id="a034">We can stick an `e.preventDefault()` into the actual method to get around this problem.</span>
-   <span id="004a">`e` : Parameter that references a `Synthetic Event` object type. Using `this` in event handlers</span>

<!-- -->

    // ./src/AlertButton.js
    import React from "react";
    class AlertButton extends React.Component {
      showAlert = () => {
        window.alert("Button clicked!");
        console.log(this);
      };
      render() {
        return (
          <button type="button" onClick={this.showAlert}>
            Click Me
          </button>
        );
      }
    }
    export default AlertButton;

-   <span id="3c8f">When we console log `this` we see the AlertButton object.</span>
-   <span id="42a0">If we were to write the showAlert method with a regular class method like:</span>

<!-- -->

    showAlert() {
      console.log(this);
    }

-   <span id="c081">We would get `undefined` =&gt; remember that fat arrow binds to the current context! Reviewing class methods and the `this` keyword</span>
-   <span id="e98e">Let’s refresh on binding.</span>

<!-- -->

    class Boyfriend {
      constructor() {
        this.name = "Momato Riruru";
      }
      displayName() {
        console.log(this.name);
      }
    }
    const Ming = new Boyfriend();
    Ming.displayName(); // => Momato Riruru
    const displayAgain = Ming.displayName;
    displayAgain(); // => Result in a Type Error: Cannot read property 'name' of undefined.

-   <span id="fb85">The first time we use our `displayMethod` call, it is called directly on the instance of the boyfriend class, which is why `Momato Riruru` was printed out.</span>
-   <span id="3a9b">The second time it was called, the ref of the method is stored as a variable and method is called on that variable instead of the instance; resulting in a type error (it has lost it’s context)</span>
-   <span id="0a2c">Remember we can use the `bind` method to rebind context!</span>
-   <span id="d6d9">We can refactor to get the second call working like this:</span>
-   <span id="7ead">const displayAgain = Ming.displayName.bind(Ming); displayAgain(); // =&gt; Now Momato Riruru will be printed out.</span>
-   <span id="a8b0">To continue using function declarations vs fat arrow we can assign context in a constructor within a class component.</span>

<!-- -->

    import React from "react";
    class AlertButton extends React.Component {
      constructor() {
        super();
        this.showAlert = this.showAlert.bind(this); // binding context
      }
      showAlert() {
        console.log(this);
      }
      render() {
        return (
          <button type="button" onClick={this.showAlert}>
            Submit
          </button>
        );
      }
    }
    export default AlertButton;

-   <span id="a4e6">`Experimental Syntax` : Syntax that has been proposed to add to ECMAScript but hasn’t officially been added to the language specification yet.</span>
-   <span id="801d">It’s good to pick one approach and use it consistently, either:</span>

1.  <span id="2e3e">Class Properties & Arrow Functions</span>
2.  <span id="cc27">Bind Method & This Keyword The `SyntheticEvent` object</span>

-   <span id="f177">Synthetic Event Objects: Cross Browser wrappeds around the browser’s native event.</span>

### Forms in React

*Exercise being done in a separate file* Random Notes

-   <span id="45ec">`onChange` : detects when a value of an input element changes.</span>
-   <span id="9ca4">Assigning `onChange` to our input fields makes our component’s state update in real time during user input.</span>
-   <span id="eb83">Dont forget to add `preventDefault` onto form submissions to deal with the default behavior of the browser refreshing the page!</span>
-   <span id="c413">`submittedOn: new Date(),` Can be added to a form, most likely will persist into a DB.</span>
-   <span id="b97f">Controlled Components</span>
-   <span id="ac48">We use the `onChange` event handlers on form fields to keep our component’s state as the `"one source of truth"`</span>
-   <span id="4685">Adding an `onChange` event handler to every single input can massively bloat your code.</span>
-   <span id="448c">Try assiging it to it’s own method to apply everywhere.</span>
-   <span id="f229">`textarea` is handled differently in react: it takes in a value property to handle what the inner text will be.</span>

-   <span id="6d0b">There are three central philosophies of Redux:</span>

1.  <span id="12ac">`A Single Source of Truth` : state is stored in a POJO</span>
2.  <span id="d178">`State is Read Only` : State is immutable, modified by dispatching actions.</span>
3.  <span id="51c5">`Changes are Made with Pure Functions` : Reducers that receive the actions and return updated state are pure functions of the old state and action. When is it appropriate to use Redux?</span>

-   <span id="117f">When doing a project with simpler global state requirements, it may be better to choose React’s Context API over Redux.</span>
-   <span id="5d3d">Redux offers more flexibility and support for middleware along with richer developer tools. Vocabulary</span>
-   <span id="1ceb">`State`</span>
-   <span id="49e7">*Redux is a State Manager*</span>
-   <span id="5018">State is all the information stored by that program at a particular point in time.</span>
-   <span id="8fdb">Redux’s main job is to store the state and make it directly available to your entire app.</span>

-   <span id="8bcf">`Actions`</span>
-   <span id="2049">*Redux store is updated by dispatching actions*</span>
-   <span id="cbac">Action is just a POJO that includes a mandatory `type` property.</span>
-   <span id="f2d5">Contain info to update the store.</span>
-   <span id="1bd9">We dispatch actions in response to User actions or AJAX requests.</span>
-   <span id="1b78">`Pure Functions`</span>
-   <span id="c436">*Redux Reducers are Pure Functions*</span>
-   <span id="e204">Functions are pure when their behavior depends only on it’s arguments as has no side effects.</span>

### Store

-   <span id="cd1e">Simply an object that holds the application state wrapped in an API.</span>
-   <span id="f57c">`Three methods`:</span>
-   <span id="354c">`getState()` : Returns the store’s current state.</span>
-   <span id="537c">`dispatch(action)` : Passes an action into the store’s reducer to tell it what info to update.</span>
-   <span id="4539">`subscribe(callback)` : Registers a callback to be triggered whenever the store updates. Updating the Store</span>

<!-- -->

    store.dispatch(action);
    // Add Orange Action
    const addOrange = {
      type: "ADD_FRUIT",
      fruit: "orange",
    };
    // Reducer for Orange Action
    const fruitReducer = (state = [], action) => {
      switch (action.type) {
        case "ADD_FRUIT":
          return [...state, action.fruit];
        default:
          return state;
      }
    };
    // Run the Dispatch
    console.log(store.getState()); // []
    store.dispatch(addOrange);
    console.log(store.getState()); // [ 'orange' ]

Subscribing to the store

-   <span id="1a02">Whenever a store process a dispatch(), it triggers all its subscribers.</span>
-   <span id="e667">`Subscribers` : callbacks that can be added to the store via subscribe().</span>

<!-- -->

    const display = () => {
      console.log(store.getState());
    };
    const unsubscribeDisplay = store.subscribe(display);
    store.dispatch(addOrange); // [ 'orange', 'orange' ]
    // display will no longer be invoked after store.dispatch()
    unsubscribeDisplay();
    store.dispatch(addOrange); // no output

Reviewing a simple example

    // app.js
    const { createStore } = require("redux");
    // Define the store's reducer.
    const fruitReducer = (state = [], action) => {
      switch (action.type) {
        case "ADD_FRUIT":
          return [...state, action.fruit];
        default:
          return state;
      }
    };
    // Create the store.
    const store = createStore(fruitReducer);
    // Define an 'ADD_FRUIT' action for adding an orange to the store.
    const addOrange = {
      type: "ADD_FRUIT",
      fruit: "orange",
    };
    // Log to the console the store's state before and after
    // dispatching the 'ADD_FRUIT' action.
    console.log(store.getState()); // []
    store.dispatch(addOrange);
    console.log(store.getState()); // [ 'orange' ]
    // Define and register a callback to listen for store updates
    // and console log the store's state.
    const display = () => {
      console.log(store.getState());
    };
    const unsubscribeDisplay = store.subscribe(display);
    // Dispatch the 'ADD_FRUIT' action. This time the `display` callback
    // will be called by the store when its state is updated.
    store.dispatch(addOrange); // [ 'orange', 'orange' ]
    // Unsubscribe the `display` callback to stop listening for store updates.
    unsubscribeDisplay();
    // Dispatch the 'ADD_FRUIT' action one more time
    // to confirm that the `display` method won't be called
    // when the store state is updated.
    store.dispatch(addOrange); // no output

### Reducers

-   <span id="98f3">Reducer function receives the current `state` and `action`, updates the state appropriately based on the `action.type` and returns the following state.</span>
-   <span id="4cee">You can bundles different action types and ensuing logic by using a switch/case statement.</span>

<!-- -->

    const fruitReducer = (state = [], action) => {
      switch (action.type) {
        case "ADD_FRUIT":
          return [...state, action.fruit];
        case "ADD_FRUITS":
          return [...state, ...action.fruits];
        case "SELL_FRUIT":
          const index = state.indexOf(action.fruit);
          if (index !== -1) {
            // remove first instance of action.fruit
            return [...state.slice(0, index), ...state.slice(index + 1)];
          }
          return state; // if action.fruit is not in state, return previous state
        case "SELL_OUT":
          return [];
        default:
          return state;
      }
    };

Reviewing how Array\#slice works

    const fruits = ["apple", "apple", "orange", "banana", "watermelon"];
    // The index of the 'orange' element is 2.
    const index = fruits.indexOf("orange");
    // `...fruits.slice(0, index)` returns the array ['apple', 'apple']
    // `...fruits.slice(index + 1)` returns the array ['banana', 'watermelon']
    // The spread syntax combines the two array slices into the array
    // ['apple', 'apple', 'banana', 'watermelon']
    const newFruits = [...fruits.slice(0, index), ...fruits.slice(index + 1)];

-   <span id="f322">Approach that can be used to remove an element without mutating the original array. Avoiding state mutations</span>
-   <span id="f862">Your reducer must always return a new object if the state changes. GOOD</span>

<!-- -->

    const goodReducer = (state = { count: 0 }, action) => {
      switch (action.type) {
        case "INCREMENT_COUNTER":
          const nextState = Object.assign({}, state);
          nextState.count++;
          return nextState;
        default:
          return state;
      }
    };

BAD

    const badReducer = (state = { count: 0 }, action) => {
      switch (action.type) {
        case "INCREMENT_COUNTER":
          state.count++;
          return state;
        default:
          return state;
      }
    };

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Actions

-   <span id="64b4">Actions are the only way to trigger changes to the store’s state. Using action creators</span>

<!-- -->

    const addOrange = {
      type: "ADD_FRUIT",
      fruit: "orange",
    };
    store.dispatch(addOrange);
    console.log(store.getState()); // [ 'orange' ]

-   <span id="c39d">fruit is the `payload key` and orange is the `state data`</span>
-   <span id="43e2">`Action Creators` : Functions created from extrapolating the creation of an action object.</span>

<!-- -->

    const addFruit = (fruit) => ({
      type: "ADD_FRUIT",
      fruit,
    });

-   <span id="11fd">Use parenthesis for implicit return value.</span>
-   <span id="eea8">We can now add whatever fruit we’d like.</span>

<!-- -->

    store.dispatch(addFruit("apple"));
    store.dispatch(addFruit("strawberry"));
    store.dispatch(addFruit("lychee"));
    console.log(store.getState()); // [ 'orange', 'apple', 'strawberry', 'lychee' ]

Preventing typos in action type string literals

    const ADD_FRUIT = "ADD_FRUIT";
    const ADD_FRUITS = "ADD_FRUITS";
    const SELL_FRUIT = "SELL_FRUIT";
    const SELL_OUT = "SELL_OUT";
    const addFruit = (fruit) => ({
      type: ADD_FRUIT,
      fruit,
    });
    const addFruits = (fruits) => ({
      type: ADD_FRUITS,
      fruits,
    });
    const sellFruit = (fruit) => ({
      type: SELL_FRUIT,
      fruit,
    });
    const sellOut = () => ({
      type: SELL_OUT,
    });

-   <span id="ae86">Using constant variables helps reduce simple typos in a reducer’s case clauses.</span>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Debugging Arrow Functions

-   <span id="43c6">It is important to learn how to use debugger statements with arrow functions to effectively debug Redux cycle. Understanding the limitations of implicit return values</span>

<!-- -->

    const addFruit = (fruit) => {
      return {
        type: "ADD_FRUIT",
        fruit,
      };
    };
    const addFruit = (fruit) => {
      debugger;
      return {
        type: "ADD_FRUIT",
        fruit,
      };
    };

-   <span id="2806">You must use explicit return statement arrow function to use a debugger.</span>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### React Router Introduction

Now that you know how to render components in a React app, how do you handle rendering different components for different website pages? React Router is the answer!

Think of how you have created server-side routes in Express. Take the following URL and server-side route. Notice how the `/users/:userId` path corresponds with the `http://localhost:3000/users/2` URL to render a specific HTML page.

    // http://localhost:3000/users/2
    app.get('/users/:userId', (req, res) => {
      res.render('userProfile.pug');
    });

In the default React setup, you lose the ability to create routes in the same manner as in Express. This is what React Router aims to solve!

<a href="https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">React Router</a> is a frontend routing library that allows you to control which components to display using the browser location. A user can also copy and paste a URL and email it to a friend or link to it from their own website.

When you finish this article, you should be able to use the following from the `react-router-dom` library:

-   <span id="e5d3">`<BrowserRouter>` to provide your application access to the `react-router-dom` library; and</span>
-   <span id="e1cd">`<Route>` to connect specific URL paths to specific components you want rendered; and</span>
-   <span id="bf15">`<Switch>` to wrap several `Route` elements, rendering only one even if several match the current URL; and</span>
-   <span id="0318">React Router’s `match` prop to access route path parameters.</span>

### Getting started with routing

Since you are writing single page apps, you don’t want to refresh the page each time you change the browser location. Instead, you want to update the browser location and your app’s response using JavaScript. This is known as client-side routing. You are using React, so you will use React Router to do this.

Create a simple react project template:

    npx create-react-app my-app --template @appacademy/simple

Then install React Router:

    npm install --save react-router-dom@^5.1.2

Now import `BrowserRouter` from `react-router-dom` in your entry file:

    import { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom`;

### BrowserRouter

`BrowserRouter` is the primary component of the router that wraps your route hierarchy. It creates a React context that passes routing information down to all its descendent components. For example, if you want to give `<App>` and all its children components access to React Router, you would wrap `<App>` like so:

    // ./src/index.js
    import React from 'react';
    import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
    import { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom';
    import App from './App';
    const Root = () => {
    return (
    <BrowserRouter>
    <App />
    </BrowserRouter>
    );
    };
    ReactDOM.render(

    <React.StrictMode>

    <Root />

    </React.StrictMode>,

    document.getElementById('root'),

    );
    Now you can route the rendering of certain components to certain URLs (i.e https://www.website.com/profile).
    HashRouter
    Alternatively, you could import and use HashRouter from react-router-dom. Links for applications that use <HashRouter> would look like https://www.website.com/#/profile (with an # between the domain and path).
    You’ll focus on using the <BrowserRouter>.
    Creating frontend routes
    React Router helps your React application render specific components based on the URL. The React Router component you’ll use most often is <Route>.
    The <Route> component is used to wrap another component, causing that component to only be rendered if a certain URL is matched. The behavior of the <Route> component is controlled by the following props: path, component, exact, and render (optional).
    Create a simple Users component that returns <h1>This is the users index!</h1>. Now let’s refactor your index.js file so that you can create your routes within the component:
    // ./src/index.js
    import React from 'react';
    import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
    import { BrowserRouter, Route } from 'react-router-dom';
    import App from './App';
    import Users from './Users';
    const Root = () => {
    return (
    <BrowserRouter>
    <div>
    {/* TODO: Routes */}
    </div>
    </BrowserRouter>
    );
    };
    ReactDOM.render(

    <React.StrictMode>

    <Root />

    </React.StrictMode>,

    document.getElementById('root'),

    );
    Note that BrowserRouter can only have a single child component, so the snippet above wraps all routes within parent a <div> element. Now let’s create some routes!
    component
    Begin with the component prop. This prop takes a reference to the component to be rendered. Let’s render your App component:
    const Root = () => {
      return (
        <BrowserRouter>
          <div>
            <Route component={App} />
          </div>
        </BrowserRouter>
      );
    };

Now you’ll need to connect a path to the component!

### path

The wrapped component will only be rendered when the path is matched. The path matches the URL when it matches some initial portion of the URL. For example, a path of `/` would match both of the following URLs: `/` and `/users`. (Because `/users` begins with a `/` it matches the path `/`)

    <Route path='/' component={App} />
    <Route path='/users' component={Users} />

Take a moment to navigate to `http://localhost:3000/users` to see how both the `App` component and `Users` component are rendering.

### exact

If this `exact` flag is set, the path will only match when it exactly matches the URL. Then browsing to the `/users` path would no longer match `/` and only the `Users` component will be rendered (instead of both the `App` component and `Users` component).

    <Route exact path='/' component={App} />
    <Route path='/users' component={Users} />

### render

This is an optional prop that takes in a function to be called. The function will be called when the path matches. The function’s return value is rendered. You could also define a functional component inside the `component` prop, but this results in extra, unnecessary work for React. The `render` prop is preferred for inline rendering of simple functional components.

The difference between using `component` and `render` is that `component` returns new JSX to be re-mounted every time the route renders, while `render` simply returns to JSX what will be mounted once and re-rendered. For any given route, you should only use either the `component` prop, or the `render` prop. If both are supplied, only the `component` prop will be used.

    // This inline rendering will work, but is unnecessarily slow.
    <Route path="/hello" component={() => <h1>Hello!</h1>} />
    // This is the preferred way for inline rendering.

    <Route path="/hello" render={() => <h1>Hello!</h1>} />
    It can be helpful to use render instead of component in your <Route> when you need to pass props into the rendered component. For example, imagine that you needed to pass the users object as a prop to your Users component. Then you could pass in props from Root to Users by returning the Users component like so:
    // `users` to be passed as a prop:
    const users = {
      1: { name: 'Andrew' },
      2: { name: 'Raymond' }
    };
    <Route path="/users" render={() => <Users users={users} />} />
    As a reminder, BrowserRouter can only have a single child component. That’s why you have wrapped all your routes within parent a <div> element.
    const Root = () => {
      const users = {
        1: { name: 'Andrew' },
        2: { name: 'Raymond' }
      };
    return (

    <BrowserRouter>

    <div>

    <h1>Hi, I'm Root!</h1>

    <Route exact path="/" component={App} />

    <Route path="/hello" render={() => <h1>Hello!</h1>} />

    <Route path="/users" render={() => <Users users={users} />} />

    </div>

    </BrowserRouter>

    );

    };
    With this Root component, you will always render the <h1>Hi, I'm Root!</h1>, regardless of the path. Because of the first <Route>, you will only render the App component if the path exactly matches /. Because of the second <Route>, you will only render the Users component if the path matches /users.
    Route path params
    A component’s props can also hold information about a URL’s parameters. The router will match route segments starting at : up to the next /, ?, or #. Those matched values are then passed to components via their props. Such segments are wildcard values that make up your route parameters.
    For example, take the route below:
    <Route path="/users/:userId"
           render={(props) => <Profile users={users} {...props} />} />

The router would break down the full `/users/:userId/photos` path to two parts: `/users`, `:userId`.

The `Profile` component’s props would have access to the `:userId` part of the `http://localhost:3000/users/:userId/photos` URL through the `props` with router parameter information. You would access the the `match` prop’s parameters (`props.match.params`). If you are using the `render` prop of the `Route` component, make sure to spread the props back into the component if you want it to know about the “match” parameters.

    // Route's `render` prop allows you to pass the `users`
    // prop and spread the router `props`.
    render={(props) => <Profile users={users} {...props} />}

The `params` object would then have a property of `userId` which would hold the value of the `:userId` *wildcard* value. Let’s render the `userId` parameter in a user profile component. Take a moment to create a `Profile.js` file with the following code:

    // ./src/Profile.js
    import React from "react";
    const Profile = (props) => (
    <div>
    The user's id is {props.match.params.userId}.
    </div>
    );
    export default Profile;
    Notice how it uses the match prop to access the :userId parameter from the URL. You can use this wildcard to make and AJAX call to fetch the user information from the database and render the return data in the Profile component. Recall that your Profile component was rendered at the path /users/:userId. Thus you can use your userId parameters from match.params to fetch a specific user:
    // ./src/Profile.js
    import React from "react";
    const Profile = ({ users, match: { params } }) => {
    // In a real-world scenario, you'd make a call to an API to fetch the user,
    // instead of passing down and keying into a users prop.
    const user = users[params.userId];
    return (
    <div>
    The user's id is {params.userId} and the user's name is {user.name}.
    </div>
    );
    };
    export default Profile;
    Match
    Now that you’ve seen your React Router’s match prop in action, let’s go over more about route props! React Router passes information to the components as route props, accessible to all components with access to the React Router. The three props it makes available are location, match and history. You’ve learned about props.match.params, but now let’s review the other properties of the match prop!
    This is an object that contains important information about how the current URL matches the route path. Here are some of the more useful keys on the match object:

    isExact: a boolean that tells you whether or not the URL exactly matches the path
    url: the current URL
    path: the route path it matched against (without wildcards filled in)
    params: the matches for the individual wildcard segments, nested under their names

    When you use React Router, the browser location and history are a part of the state of your app. You can store information about which component should be displayed, which user profile you are currently viewing, or any other piece of state, in the browser location. You can then access that information from anywhere your Router props are passed to in your app.
    Now that you’ve learned about parameters and route props, let’s revisit your Root component to add an exact flag to your /users route so that it does not render with your /users/:userId route. Your component should look something like this:
    const Root = () => {
      const users = {
        1: { name: 'Andrew' },
        2: { name: 'Raymond' }
      };
    return (
    <BrowserRouter>
    <h1>Hi, I'm Root!</h1>
    <div>
    <Route exact path="/" component={App} />
    <Route path="/hello" render={() => <h1>Hello!</h1>} />
        {/* Render the `Users` page if no ID is included. */}
        &lt;Route exact path=&quot;/users&quot; render={() =&gt; &lt;Users users={users} /&gt;} /&gt;

        {/* Otherwise, render the profile page for that userId. */}
        &lt;Route path=&quot;/users/:userId&quot; component={(props) =&gt; &lt;Profile users={users} {...props} /&gt;} /&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/BrowserRouter&gt;

    );

    };
    What you learned
    In this article, you learned how to:

    Use components from the React Router library; and
    Create routes to render specific components; and
    Manage the order of rendered routes; and
    Use the exact flag to ensure that a specific path renders a specific component; and
    Use the React Router match prop to access Router params.


    React Router Navigation
    Now that you know how to create front-end routes with React Router, you’ll need to implement a way for your users to navigate the routes! This is what using React Router’s Link, NavLink, Redirect, and history prop can help you do.
    In this article, you’ll be working off of the demo project you built in the React Router Intro reading. When you finish this article, you should be able to use the following components from the react-router-dom library:

    <Link> or <NavLink> to create links with absolute paths to routes in your application (like “/users/1”); and,
    <Redirect> to redirect a user to another path (i.e. a login page when the user is not logged in); and
    React Router’s history prop to update a browser’s URL programmatically.

    Adding links for navigation
    React Router’s <Link> is one way to simplify navigation around your app. It issues an on-click navigation event to a route defined in your app’s router. Using <Link> renders an anchor tag with a correctly set href attribute.
    Link
    To use it, update your imports from the react-router-dom package to include Link:
    import { BrowserRouter, Route, Link } from 'react-router-dom';

Note that `<Link>` can take two props: `to` and `onClick`.

The `to` prop is a route location description that points to an absolute path, (i.e. `/users`). Add the following `Link` components in your `index.js` file above your routes:

    <Link to="/">App</Link>
    <Link to="/users">Users</Link>
    <Link to="/users/1">Andrew's Profile</Link>

The `onClick` prop is just like any other JSX click handler. You can write a function that takes in an `event` and handles it. Add the following `Link` before your routes and the following click handler function within your `Root` component:

    // Link with onClick prop
    <Link to="/" onClick={handleClick}>App with click handler</Link>
    // Click handler function

    const handleClick = () => {

    console.log('Thanks for clicking!')

    };
    Now, test your routes and links! If you inspect the page, you’ll see that your links are now rendered as <a> elements. Notice that clicking the App with click handler link logs a message in your console while directing your browser to render the App component.
    NavLink
    The <NavLink> works just like a <Link>, but with a little extra functionality. It has the ability to add extra styling when the path it links to matches the current path. This makes it an ideal choice for a navigation bar, hence the name. This styling can be controlled by three extra props: activeClassName, activeStyle, and exact. To begin using NavLink, update your imports from the react-router-dom package:
    import { BrowserRouter, Route, NavLink } from 'react-router-dom';

The `activeClassName` prop of the `NavLink` component allows you to set a CSS class name for styling the `NavLink` when its route is active. By default, the `activeClassName` is already set to `active`. This means that you simply need to add an `.active` class to your CSS file to add active styling to your link. A `NavLink` will be active if its `to` prop path matches the current URL.

Let’s change your “Users”, “Hello”, and “Andrew’s Profile” links to be different colors and have a larger font size when active.

    <NavLink to="/">App</NavLink>
    <NavLink activeClassName="red" to="/users">Users</NavLink>
    <NavLink activeClassName="blue" to="/hello">Hello</NavLink>
    <NavLink activeClassName="green" to="/users/1">Andrew's Profile</NavLink>
    <NavLink to="/" onClick={handleClick}>App with click handler</NavLink>

For example, this is what the rendered HTML `<a>` tag would look like when when the browser is navigated to the `/` path or the `/users` path:

    <!-- Navigated to the / path (the activeClassName
         prop is set to active by default) -->
    <a href="/" class="active">App</a>
    <!-- NOT navigated to the / path -->
    <a href="/">App</a>
    <!-- Navigated to the /users path (the activeClassName
    prop is manually set to red) -->
    <a href="/users" class="red">Users</a>
    <!-- NOT navigated to the /users path -->

    <a href="/users">Users</a>
    Import NavLink into your index.js file and take a moment to update all your Link elements to NavLink elements. Set an activeClassName prop to an active class. Add the following .active class to your index.css file:
    .active {
      font-weight: bold;
    }
    .red {
    color: red;
    font-size: 30px;
    }
    .blue {
    color: blue;
    font-size: 30px;
    }
    .green {

    color: green;

    font-size: 30px;

    }
    Test your styled links! Notice how the App and App with click handler links are always bolded. This is because all of your links include the / path, meaning that the link to / will be active when browsing to /users and /users/1 because of how users and users/1 are both prefaced by a /.
    The activeStyle prop is a style object that will be applied inline to the NavLink when its to prop matches the current URL. Add the following activeStyle to your App link and comment out the .active class in your CSS file.
    <NavLink to="/" activeStyle={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>App</NavLink>

The following html is rendered when at the `/` path:

    <a href="/" style="font-weight:bold;" class="active">App</a>

Notice how your `App with click handler` is not bolded anymore. This is because the default `active` class being applied does not have any CSS stylings set to the class. Uncomment your `.active` class in your CSS file to bring back bolding to this NavLink.

The `exact` prop is a boolean that defaults to `false`. If set to `true`, then the `activeStyle` and `activeClassName` props will only be applied when the current URL exactly matches the `to` prop. Update your `App` and `App with click handler` links with an `exact` prop set. Just like in your routes, you can use the `exact` flag instead of `exact={true}`.

    <NavLink to="/" exact={true} activeStyle={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>App</NavLink>
    <NavLink to="/" exact onClick={handleClick}>App with click handler</NavLink>

Now your `App` and `App with click handler` links will only be bolded when you have navigated precisely to the `/` path.

### Switching between routes

You came across styling issues when the `/users` and `/users/1` paths matched the `/` path. Routing can have this issue as well. This is why you need to control the switching between routes.

React Router’s `<Switch>` component allows you to only render one `<Route>` even if several match the current URL. You can nest as many `Route`s as you wish between the opening and closing `Switch` tags, but only the first one that matches the current URL will be rendered.

This is particularly useful if you want a default component that will only render if none of our other routes match. View the example below. Without the Switch, `DefaultComponent` would always render. Since there isn’t set a path in the `DefaultComponent` route, it will simply use the default path of `/`. Now the `DefaultComponent` will only render when neither of the preceding routes match.

    <Switch>
      <Route path="some/url" component={SomeComponent} />
      <Route path="some/other/url" component={OtherComponent} />
      <Route component={DefaultComponent} />
    </Switch>

Import `Switch` from `react-router-dom` and add `<Switch>` tags around your routes to take care of ordering and switching between your routes! Begin by adding the following route to the bottom of your routes to render that a `404: Page not found` message:

    <Route render={() => <h1>404: Page not found</h1>} />

This is what your `Root` component should look like at this point:

    const Root = () => {
      const users = [
        { name: 'andrew' },
        { name: 'raymond' }
      ];
    const handleClick = () => {
    console.log('Thanks for clicking!')
    };
    return (
    <BrowserRouter>
    <h1>Hi, I'm Root!</h1>
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;NavLink to=&quot;/&quot; exact={true} activeStyle={{ fontWeight: &quot;bold&quot; }}&gt;App&lt;/NavLink&gt;
        &lt;NavLink activeClassName=&quot;red&quot; to=&quot;/users&quot;&gt;Users&lt;/NavLink&gt;
        &lt;NavLink activeClassName=&quot;blue&quot; to=&quot;/hello&quot;&gt;Hello&lt;/NavLink&gt;
        &lt;NavLink activeClassName=&quot;green&quot; to=&quot;/users/1&quot;&gt;Andrew&#39;s Profile&lt;/NavLink&gt;
        &lt;NavLink to=&quot;/&quot; exact onClick={handleClick}&gt;App with click handler&lt;/NavLink&gt;

        &lt;Switch&gt;
          &lt;Route path=&quot;/users/:userId&quot; component={(props) =&gt; &lt;Profile users={users} {...props} /&gt;} /&gt;
          &lt;Route exact path=&quot;/users&quot; render={() =&gt; &lt;Users users={users} /&gt;} /&gt;
          &lt;Route path=&quot;/hello&quot; render={() =&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Hello!&lt;/h1&gt;} /&gt;
          &lt;Route exact path=&quot;/&quot; component={App} /&gt;
          &lt;Route render={() =&gt; &lt;h1&gt;404: Page not found&lt;/h1&gt;} /&gt;
        &lt;/Switch&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/BrowserRouter&gt;

    );

    };
    Now you have control over the precedence of rendered components! Try navigating to http://localhost:3000/asdf or any other route you have not defined. The <h1>404: Page not found</h1> JSX of the last <Route> will be rendered whenever the browser attempts to visit an undefined route.
    Redirecting users
    But what if you want to redirect users to a login page when they aren’t logged in? The <Redirect> component from React Router helps you redirect users!
    The component takes only one prop: to. When it renders, it replaces the current URL with the value of its to prop. Typically you conditionally render <Redirect> to redirect the user away from some page you don’t want them to visit. The example below checks whether there is a defined currentUser prop. If so, the <Route> will render the Home component. Otherwise, it will redirect the user to the /login path.
    <Route
      exact path="/"
      render={() => (this.props.currentUser ? <Home /> : <Redirect to="/login" />)}
    />

Note: you will learn how to use a more flexible auth pattern — don’t directly imitate this example.

### History

You know how to redirect users with a `<Redirect>` component, but what if you need to redirect users programmatically? You’ve learned about the React Router’s `match` prop, but now let’s go over another one of the <a href="https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/Route/route-props" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">route props</a>: `history`!

    // Pushing a new URL (and adding to the end of history stack):
    const handleClick = () => this.props.history.push('/some/url');
    // Replacing the current URL (won't be tracked in history stack):

    const redirect = () => this.props.history.replace('/some/other/url');
    This prop lets you update the URL programmatically. For example, suppose you want to push a new URL when the user clicks a button. It has two useful methods:

    push - This adds a new URL to the end of the history stack. That means that clicking the back button will take the browser to the previous URL. Note that pushing the same URL multiple times in a row will have no effect; the URL will still only show up on the stack once. In development mode, pushing the same URL twice in a row will generate a console warning. This warning is disabled in production mode.
    replace - This replaces the current URL on the history stack, so the back button won’t take you to it. For example:

    What you learned
    In this article, you learned how to:

    Create navigation links for your route paths; and
    Redirect users through using the <Redirect> component; and
    Update a browser’s URL programmatically by using React Router’s history prop.


    React Router Nested Routes
    Now you know how to create front-end routes and add navigation with React Router. When initializing Express projects, you declare static routes. Static routes are routes that are declared when an application is initialized. When using React Router in your application’s initialization, you can declare dynamic routes. React Router introduces dynamic routing, where your routes are created as your application is rendering. This allows you to create nested routes within components!
    In this article, let’s dive into nested routes! When you finish the article, you should:

    Describe what nested routes are; and
    Be able to use React Router to create and navigate nested routes; and
    Know how to use the React Router match prop to generate links and routes.

    Why nested routes?
    Let’s begin with why you might need nested routes. As you remember, you are using React to create a single-page application. This means that you’ll be organizing your application into different components and sub-components.
    For example, imagine creating a simple front-end application with three main pages: a home welcome page (path of /), a users index page (path of /users), and user profile pages (path of /users/:userId). Now imagine if every user had links to separate posts and photos pages.
    You can create those routes and links within the user profile component, instead of creating the routes and links where the main routes are defined.
    What are nested routes?
    Now let’s dive into a user profile component to understand what are nested routes! Imagine you have a route in your application’s entry file to each user’s profile like so:
    <Route path="/users/:userId" component={Profile} />

This means that upon navigating to `http://localhost:3000/users/1`, you would render the following `Profile` component and the `userId` parameter within `props.match.params` would have the value of `"1"`.

    const Profile = (props) => {
      // Custom call to database to fetch a user by a user ID.
      const user = fetchUser(props.match.params.userId);
      const { name, id } = user;
    return (
    <div>
    <h1>Welcome to the profile of {name}!</h1>
      {/* Links to a specific user&#39;s posts and photos */}
      &lt;Link to={`/users/${id}/posts`}&gt;{name}&#39;s Posts&lt;/Link&gt;
      &lt;Link to={`/users/${id}/photos`}&gt;{name}&#39;s Photos&lt;/Link&gt;

      {/* Routes to a specific user&#39;s posts and photos */}
      &lt;Route path=&#39;/users/:userId/posts&#39; component={UserPosts} /&gt;
      &lt;Route path=&#39;/users/:userId/photos&#39; component={UserPhotos} /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    );

    };
    Since this route is not created until the Profile component is rendered, you are dynamically creating your nested /users/:userId/posts and /users/:userId/photos routes. Remember that your match prop also has other helpful properties. You can use match.url instead of /users/${id} in your profile links. You can also use match.path instead of /users/:userId in your profile routes. Remember that you can destructure url, path, and params from your match prop!
    // Destructure `match` prop
    const Profile = ({ match: { url, path, params }) => {
    // Custom call to database to fetch a user by a user ID.
    const user = fetchUser(params.userId);
    const { name, id } = user;
    return (
    <div>
    <h1>Welcome to the profile of {name}!</h1>
      {/* Replaced `/users/${id}` URL with `props.match.url` */}
      &lt;Link to={`${url}/posts`}&gt;{name}&#39;s Posts&lt;/Link&gt;
      &lt;Link to={`${url}/photos`}&gt;{name}&#39;s Photos&lt;/Link&gt;

      {/* Replaced `/users/:userId` path with `props.match.path` */}
      &lt;Route path={`${path}/posts`} component={UserPosts} /&gt;
      &lt;Route path={`${path}/photos`} component={UserPhotos} /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;}

    );

    };
    In tomorrow’s project, you’ll build a rainbow of routes as well as define nested routes. In the future, you may choose to implement nested routes to keep your application’s routes organized within related components.

    React Builds
    A “build” is the process of converting code into something that can actually execute or run on the target platform. A “front-end build” is a process of preparing a front-end or client-side application for the browser.
    With React applications, that means (at a minimum) converting JSX to something that browsers can actually understand. When using Create React App, the build process is automatically configured to do that and a lot more.
    When you finish this article, you should be able to:

    Describe what front-end builds are and why they’re needed;
    Describe at a high level what happens in a Create React App when you run npm start; and
    Prepare to deploy a React application into a production environment.

    Understanding front-end builds
    The need for front-end builds predates React. Over the years, developers have found it helpful to extend the lowest common denominator version of JavaScript and CSS that they could use.
    Sometimes developers extend JavaScript and CSS with something like TypeScript or Sass. Using these non-standard languages and syntaxes require you to use a build process to convert your code into standard JavaScript and CSS that can actually run in the browser.
    Browser-based applications also require a fair amount of optimization to deliver the best, or at least acceptable, experience to end users. Front-end build processes could be configured to lint code, run unit tests, optimize images, minify and bundle code, and more — all automatically at the press of a button (i.e. running a command at the terminal).
    JavaScript versions and the growth of front-end builds
    Developers are generally an impatient lot. When new features are added to JavaScript, we don’t like to wait for browsers to widely support those features before we start to use them in our code. And we really don’t like when we have to support older, legacy versions of browsers.
    In recent years, JavaScript has been updated on a yearly basis and browser vendors do a decent job of updating their browsers to support the new features as they’re added to the language. Years ago though, there was an infamous delay between versions 5 and 6 of JavaScript. It took years before ES6 (or ES2015 as it eventually was renamed to) to officially be completed and even longer before browsers supported all of its features.
    In the period of time before ES2015 was broadly supported by browsers, developers used front-end builds to convert or transpile ES2015 features and syntax to an older version of the language that was more broadly supported by browsers (typically ES5). The transpilation from ES2015/ES6 down to ES5 was one of the major drivers for developers to add front-end builds to their client-side projects.
    Reviewing common terminology
    When learning about front-end or React builds, you’ll encounter a lot of terminology that you may or may not be familiar with. Here’s some of the terminology that you’ll likely encounter:
    Linting is process of using a tool to analyze your code to catch common programming errors, bugs, stylistic inconsistencies, and suspicious coding patterns. ESLint is a popular JavaScript linting tool.
    Transpilation is the process of converting source code, like JavaScript, from one version to another version. Usually this means converting newer versions of JavaScript, ES2019 or ES2021, to a version that’s more widely supported by browsers, like ES2015, or even ES5 or ES3 (if you need to support the browser that your parents or grandparents use).
    Minification is the process of removing all unnecessary characters in your code (e.g. white space characters, new line characters, comments) to produce an overall smaller file. Minification tools will often also rename identifers in your code (i.e. parameter and variable names) in the quest for smaller and smaller file sizes. Source maps can also be generated to allow debugging tools to cross reference between minified code and the original source code.
    Bundling is the process of combining multiple code files into a single file. Creating a bundle (or a handful of bundles) reduces the number of requests that a client needs to make to the server.
    Tree shaking is the process of removing unused (or dead) code from your application before it’s bundled. Tree shaking external dependencies can sometimes have a dramatic positive impact on overall bundled file sizes.
    Configuration or code?
    Front-end build tools have come and gone over the years; sometimes very quickly, which helped bring about the phenomenon known as JavaScript fatigue.
    Configuration based tools allow you to create your build tasks by declaring (usually using JSON, XML, or YAML) what you want to be done, without explicitly writing every step in the process. In contrast, coding or scripting based tools allow you to, well, write code to create your build tasks. Configuration based tools can sometimes feel simpler to use while giving up some control (at least initially) while coding based tools can feel more familiar and predictable (since you’re describing tasks procedurally). Every generalization is false though (including this one), so there are plenty of exceptions.
    Grunt is a JSON configuration based task runner that can be used to orchestrate the various tasks that make up your front-end build. Grunt was very quickly supplanted by Gulp, which allowed developers to write JavaScript to define front-end build tasks. After Gulp, the front-end tooling landscape became a bit more muddled. Some developers preferred the simplicity of using npm scripts to define build tasks while others preferred the power of configuration based bundlers like webpack.
    Babel and webpack (yes, that’s intentionally a lowercase ‘w’)
    As front-end or client-side applications grew in complexity, developers found themselves wanting to leverage more advanced JavaScript features and newer syntax like classes, arrow functions, destructuring, async/await, etc. Using a code transpiler, like Babel, allows you to use all of the latest and greatest features and syntax without worrying about what browsers support what.
    Module loaders and bundlers, like webpack, also allowed developers to use JavaScript modules without requiring users to use a browser that natively supports ES modules. Also, module bundling (along with minification and tree-shaking) helps to reduce the bandwidth that’s required to deliver the assets for your application to the client.
    [Create React App][cra] uses webpack (along with Babel) under the covers to build your React applications. Even if you’re not using Create React App, webpack and Babel are still very popular choices for building React applications.
    Pulling back the covers (a bit) on the Create React App build process
    Running an application created by Create React App using npm start can feel magical. Some stuff happens in the terminal and your application opens into your default browser. Even better, when you make changes to your application, your changes will (usually) automatically appear in the browser!
    The Create React App build process
    At a high level, here’s what happens when you run npm start:

    Environment variables are loaded (more about this in a bit);
    The list of browsers to support are checked (more about this too in a bit);
    The configured HTTP port is checked to ensure that it’s available;
    The application compiler is configured and created;
    webpack-dev-server is started;
    webpack-dev-server compiles your application;
    The index.html file is loaded into the browser; and
    A file watcher is started to watch your files, waiting for changes.

    Ejecting
    Create React App provides a script that you can run to “eject” your application from the Create React App tooling. When you eject your application, all of the hidden stuff is exposed so that you can review and customize it.

    The need to customize Create React App rarely happens. Also, don’t eject an actual project as it’s a one-way trip! Once a Create React App project has been ejected, there’s no going back (though you could always undo the ejection process by reverting to an earlier commit if you’re using source control).

    To eject your application from Create React App, run the command npm run eject. You’ll be prompted if you want to continue; type “y” to continue with the ejection process. Once the ejection process has completed, you can review the files that were previously hidden from you.
    In the package.json file, you’ll see the following npm scripts:
    {
      "scripts": {
        "start": "node scripts/start.js",
        "build": "node scripts/build.js",
        "test": "node scripts/test.js"
      }
    }

You can open the `./scripts/start.js` file to see the code that’s executed when you run `npm start`.

If you’re curious about the webpack configuration, you can open and review the `./config/webpack.config.js`.

### Preparing to deploy a React application for production

Before you deploy your application to production, you’ll want to make sure that you’ve replaced static values in your code with environment variables and considered what browsers you need to support.

### Defining environment variables

Create React App supports defining environment variables in an `.env` file. To define an environment variable, add an `.env` file to your project and define one or more variables that start with the prefix `REACT_APP_`:

    REACT_APP_FOO: some value
    REACT_APP_BAR: another value

Environment variables can be used in code like this:

    console.log(process.env.REACT_APP_FOO);

You can also reference environment variables in your `index.html` like this:

    <title>%REACT_APP_BAR%</title>

> *Important: Environment variables are embedded into your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript bundles during the build process. Because of this, it’s* very important *to not store any secrets, like API keys, in your environment variables as anyone can view your bundled code in the browser by inspecting your files.*

### Configuring the supported browsers

In your project’s `package.json` file, you can see the list of targeted browsers:

    {
      "browserslist": {
        "production": [
          ">0.2%",
          "not dead",
          "not op_mini all"
        ],
        "development": [
          "last 1 chrome version",
          "last 1 firefox version",
          "last 1 safari version"
        ]
      }
    }

Adjusting these targets affect how your code will be transpiled. Specifying older browser versions will result in your code being transpiled to older versions of JavaScript in order to be compatible with the specified browser versions. The `production` list specifies the browsers to target when creating a production build and the `development` list specifics the browsers to target when running the application using `npm         start`.

The <a href="https://browserl.ist/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">browserl.ist</a> website can be used to see the browsers supported by your configured `browserslist`.

### Creating a production build

To create a production build, run the command `npm run build`. The production build process bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. When the command completes, you’ll find your production ready files in the `build` folder.

Now your application is ready to be deployed!

### Rainbow Routes Project

Today you’re going to get our first experience using React Router. The goal is to create a basic app that displays the colors of the rainbow. This rainbow, however, has something special about it — some of the colors are nested within others.

### Phase 0: Setup

Begin by creating a new React project:

    npx create-react-app rainbow-routes --template @appacademy/simple

Now you’ll remove all the contents of your `src` and all the contents from your `public` directory to build the application architecture from scratch! After you have deleted all your files within the directories, create a new `index.html` file in your `public` folder. Use the `html:5` emmet shortcut to generate an HTML template. Title your page “Rainbow Routes” and create a `div` with an `id` of `root` in your DOM’s `<body>` element. Create an `index.css` file in your `src` directory with the following code. Now let’s create your entry file!

    h4 {
      color: darkblue;
      cursor: pointer;
    }
    h4:hover {
    text-decoration: underline;
    }
    #rainbow {
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    left: 300px;
    }
    h3 {
    position: absolute;
    top: 1px;
    }
    .red {
    background-color: red;
    width: 100px;
    height: 100px;
    }
    .orange {
    background-color: orange;
    width: 100px;
    height: 50px;
    }
    .yellow {
    background-color: yellow;
    width: 100px;
    height: 50px;
    }
    .green {
    background-color: green;
    width: 100px;
    height: 100px;
    }
    .blue {
    background-color: blue;
    width: 100px;
    height: 100px;
    }
    .indigo {
    background-color: mediumslateblue;
    width: 100px;
    height: 50px;
    }
    .violet {
    background-color: darkviolet;
    width: 100px;
    height: 100px;
    }
    a {

    display: block;

    margin-bottom: 10px;

    }
    Create an index.js entry file in the src directory. At the top of the file, make sure to import React from the react package and ReactDOM from the react-dom package. Make sure to also import your the index.css file you just created! This will take care of styling your rainbow routes.
    Now you can use the ReactDOM.render() method to render a <Root /> component instead of the DOM element with an id of root. Lastly, wrap your render function with a DOMContentLoaded event listener, like so:
    document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
      ReactDOM.render(
        <Root />,
        document.getElementById('root'),
      );
    });

Let’s create your `Root` component right in your entry file! Your `Root` component will take care of applying your `BrowserRouter` to the application. Applying the `BrowserRouter` to your `Root` component allows all the child components rendering within `<BrowserRouter>` tags to use and access the `Route`, `Link`, and `NavLink` components within the `react-router-dom` package.

    const Root = () => (
      // TODO: Apply BrowserRouter
      // TODO: Render rainbow
    );

Install the `react-router-dom` package:

    npm install react-router-dom@^5.0.0

Now import `BrowserRouter` from the `react-router-dom` package, like so:

    import { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom';

You’re going to be rendering a lot of components, so let’s keep your `src` directory organized by creating a `components` directory within. Within your new `./src/components` directory, create a `Rainbow.js` file for your `Rainbow` component with the following code:

    // ./src/components/Rainbow.js
    import React from 'react';
    import { Route, Link, NavLink } from 'react-router-dom';
    const Rainbow = () => (
    <div>
    <h1>Rainbow Router!</h1>
    {/* Your links should go here */}
    &lt;div id=&quot;rainbow&quot;&gt;
      {/* Your routes should go here */}
    &lt;/div&gt;

    </div>
    );
    export default Rainbow;
    Your Rainbow component will act as the home page or default path (/) of your application. Import the Rainbow component into your entry file and have your Root component render <Rainbow /> wrapped within <BrowserRouter> tags, like so:
    const Root = () => (
      <BrowserRouter>
        <Rainbow />
      </BrowserRouter>
    );

Within your `Rainbow` component, you’ll be rendering `<NavLink>` and `<Route>` components to add different navigation paths to different components. Let’s create all the components you will render!

Create files for the following components in your `./src/components` directory:

-   <span id="1c8e">`Red`</span>
-   <span id="a8dd">`Blue`</span>
-   <span id="6ca3">`Green`</span>
-   <span id="8e44">`Indigo`</span>
-   <span id="f8f2">`Orange`</span>
-   <span id="0f47">`Violet`</span>
-   <span id="8a89">`Yellow`</span>

Your `Red` and `Blue` components will look something like this:

    import React from 'react';
    import { Route, Link, NavLink } from 'react-router-dom';
    const Color = () => (
    <div>
    <h2 className="color">Color</h2>
    {/* Links here */}
    {/* Routes here */}

    </div>
    );
    export default Color;
    Your Green, Indigo, Orange, Violet, and Yellow components will look something like this:
    import React from 'react';
    const Color = () => (
    <div>
    <h3 className="color">Color</h3>
    </div>
    );
    export default Color;
    Now start your server and verify you can see the “Rainbow Router!” header from your Rainbow component. Currently there is no functionality. Let’s fix that!
    Phase 1: Routes
    As a reminder, wrapping the Rainbow component in <BrowserRouter> tags makes the router available to all descendent React Router components. Now open the Rainbow.js file. You’re going to render some of your color components from here. Ultimately you want your routes to look like this.
    URLComponents/Rainbow/redRainbow -> Red/red/orangeRainbow -> Red                   -> Orange/red/yellowRainbow -> Red ->                   Yellow/greenRainbow -> Green/blueRainbow ->                   Blue/blue/indigoRainbow -> Blue -> Indigo/violetRainbow                   -> Violet
    This means that the Red, Green, Blue, and Violet components need to render in the Rainbow component, but only when you are at the corresponding URL. You’ll do this with Route components. Begin by importing the Red, Green, Blue, and Violet components into your Rainbow.js file. Then add the necessary Route components inside the div with id="rainbow" in the Rainbow component. For example to render the Red component with the /red path, you would use the following Route component:
    <Route path="/red" component={Red} />

Test that your code works! Manually type in each URL you just created, and you should see the color component pop up. Remember, these are React Routes, so the paths you created will come after the `/`. For example, your default rainbow route will look like `http://localhost:3000/` while your red route will look like `http://localhost:3000/red`<a href="http://localhost:3000/red." class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">.</a>

You want to nest the `Orange` and `Yellow` components inside the `Red` component, and the `Indigo` component inside the `Blue` component. Remember to import your components to use them in a `Route` tag. You’ll have to go add the corresponding `Route` tags to the `Red.js` and `Blue.js` files. Make sure to use the correct nested paths, such as `"/red/orange"` for the orange `Route`.

### Phase 2: Links

Manually navigating to our newly created routes is tiresome, so let’s add functionality to take care of this process for us. React Router provides the `Link` and `NavLink` components for this purpose.

Add `Link`s to the paths `/red`, `/green`, `/blue`, and `/violet` in the `Rainbow` component. For example, your red link should look like

    <Link to="/red">Red</NavLink>

When you are at `blue` you want to be able to get to `/blue/indigo`, and then back to `/blue`. Add the corresponding `Link`s to the `Blue` component like this:

    <Link to='/blue' >Blue only</Link>
    <Link to='/blue/indigo' >Add indigo</Link>

Similarly, add `Link`s to `/red`, `/red/orange` and `/red/yellow` to the `Red` component. Test all your links. Navigation is so much easier now!

### Phase 3: NavLinks

It would be nice if our links gave us some indication of which route you were at. Fortunately, React Router has a special component for that very purpose: `NavLink`. NavLinks get an extra CSS class when their `to` prop matches the current URL. By default this class is called `active`.

Go ahead and switch all your `Link`s to `NavLink`s. If you open the app you won’t see any change yet. That’s because you haven’t added any special styling to the `active` class. Go ahead and open the `index.css` file. Create an `.active` class and add the line `font-weight: 700`. Now your active links will be bold. Isn’t that nice!

The only problem is that now the `Blue only` link is active even when the path is `/blue/indigo`. That doesn’t make a lot of sense. Let’s add the `exact` flag to that link so it will only be active when its `to` exactly matches the current path. Now it should look like:

    <NavLink exact to="/blue">
      Blue only
    </NavLink>

Do the same for the `Red only` link. Everything should be working now.

### Phase 4 — Changing NavLink’s Active Class

You’ve already set up `NavLink` to bold the link text using the `.active` class in `src/index.css`. But what if you wanted this class to be something else? For instance, what if you want your main color links (Red, Green, Blue, Violet) to be styled differently when active than your sub-route links (Red Only, Add Orange, Add Yellow, etc.).

You can set the class that React Router sets to an active `NavLink` by adding the `activeClassName` prop.

For instance, when we are at a route matching the below `NavLink`’s `to` prop, the component will have a class of `.parent-active` applied:

    <NavLink to="/blue" activeClassName="parent-active" >
      Blue
    </NavLink>

This allows much more flexibility to style an active `NavLink`!

Using the example above, add an `activeClassName` prop to each of your `NavLink`s in `src/components/Rainbow.js`. Now, add some CSS styling for that class in your `src/index.css` to distinguish your main and your sub-route links.

Compare your work to the solution and make sure the behavior is the same. Time to celebrate! ✨ 🌈 ✨

### Exploring React Builds Project

In this project, you’ll use Create React App to create a simple React application. You’ll experiment with some of the features that Create React App provides and deploy a production build of your application to a standalone Express application.

### Phase 0: Setup

Begin by using the <a href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">create-react-app</a> package to create a React application:

    npx create-react-app exploring-react-builds --template @appacademy/simple

> *Remember that using the* `create-react-app` *command initializes your project as a Git repository. If you use the* `ls -a` *to view the hidden files in your project, you’ll see the *`.git` *file.*

Update the `App` component:

-   <span id="9186">Wrap the `<h1>` element with a `<div>` element; and</span>
-   <span id="5e97">Change the `<h1>` element content to something like “Exploring React Builds”.</span>

<!-- -->

    // ./src/App.js

    import React from 'react';

    function App() {
      return (
        <div>
          <h1>Exploring React Builds</h1>
        </div>
      );
    }

    export default App;

### Phase 1: Using CSS modules

You’ve already seen an example of using the `import` keyword to import a stylesheet into a module so that it’ll be included in your application build. That’s the technique being used to include the global `index.css` stylesheet:

    // ./src/index.js
    import React from 'react';
    import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
    import './index.css';
    import App from './App';
    ReactDOM.render(

    <React.StrictMode>

    <App />

    </React.StrictMode>,

    document.getElementById('root')

    );
    You can also leverage CSS modules in your Create React App projects. CSS Modules scope stylesheet class names so that they are unique to a specific React component. This allows you to create class names without having to worry if they might collide with class names used in another component.
    Add a new css-modules folder to the src folder. Within that folder, add the following files:

    HeadingA.js
    HeadingA.module.css
    HeadingB.js
    HeadingB.module.css

    Then update the contents of each file to the following:
    // ./src/css-modules/HeadingA.js
    import React from 'react';
    import styles from './HeadingA.module.css';
    function HeadingA() {
    return (
    <h1 className={styles.heading}>Heading A</h1>
    );
    }
    export default HeadingA;
    /* ./src/css-modules/HeadingA.module.css */
    .heading {
    color: green;
    }
    // ./src/css-modules/HeadingB.js
    import React from 'react';
    import styles from './HeadingB.module.css';
    function HeadingB() {
    return (
    <h1 className={styles.heading}>Heading B</h1>
    );
    }
    export default HeadingB;
    /* ./src/css-modules/HeadingB.module.css */
    .heading {

    color: red;

    }
    Notice how the .heading CSS class name is being used within each component to set the color of the <h1> element. For the HeadingA component, the color is green, and for the HeadingB component, the color is red. Using the file naming convention [name].module.css let’s Create React App know that we want these stylesheets to be processed as CSS Modules. Using CSS Modules allows the .heading class name to be reused across components without any issue.
    To see this feature in action, update your App component to render both of your new components:
    import React from 'react';
    import HeadingA from './css-modules/HeadingA';
    import HeadingB from './css-modules/HeadingB';
    function App() {
    return (
    <div>
    <h1>Exploring React Builds</h1>
    <HeadingA />
    <HeadingB />
    </div>
    );
    }
    export default App;
    Then run your application (npm start) to see “Heading A” and “Heading B” displayed respectively in green and red. If you use the browser’s developer tools to inspect “Heading A”, you’ll see that the .heading class name has been modified so that it’s unique to the HeadingA component:
    CSS Modules is an example of how a front-end build process can be used to modify code to enable a feature that’s not natively supported by browsers.
    Phase 2: Using an image in a component
    Create React App configures webpack with support for loading images (as well as CSS, fonts, and other file types). What this means, for you as the developer, is that you can add an image file to your project, import it directly into a module, and render it in a React component.
    Download any image of off the Web or click here to download the below image.



    Then within the src folder add a new folder named image. Within that folder add a new component file named Image.js. Also add your downloaded image file to the image folder (so it’s a sibling to the Image.js file).
    Update the contents of the Image.js file to this:
    // ./src/image/Image.js
    import React from 'react';
    import cat from './react-builds-cat.png';
    console.log(cat); // /static/media/react-builds-cat.45f7f4d2.png
    function Image() {
    // Import result is the URL of your image.
    return <img src={cat} alt="images/images/Cat" />;
    }
    export default Image;
    You can import an image into a component using the import keyword. This tells webpack to include the image in the build. Notice that when you import an image into a module, you’ll get a path to the image’s location within the build. You can use this path to set the src attribute on an <img> element.

    Be sure to update the image import statement to the correct file name if you’re using your own image!

    Now update the App component to import and render the Image component:
    // ./src/App.js
    import React from 'react';
    import HeadingA from './css-modules/HeadingA';
    import HeadingB from './css-modules/HeadingB';
    import Image from './image/Image';
    function App() {
    return (
    <div>
    <h1>Exploring React Builds</h1>
    <HeadingA />
    <HeadingB />
    <Image />
    </div>
    );
    }
    export default App;
    If you run your application (npm start) you’ll see your image displayed on the page! You can also open your browser’s developer tools and view the “Sources” for the current page. If you can expand the localhost:3000 > static > media node on the left, you can see the image file that webpack copied to your build.
    Images in stylesheets
    You can also reference images in your CSS files too. Add a CSS file named Image.css to the ./src/image folder and update its contents to this:
    /* ./src/image/Image.css */
    .cat {

    background-image: url(./react-builds-cat.png);

    width: 400px;

    height: 400px;

    }
    Then update the Image component to this:
    // ./src/image/Image.js
    import React from 'react';
    import './Image.css';
    import cat from './react-builds-cat.png';
    console.log(cat); // /static/media/react-builds-cat.45f7f4d2.png
    function Image() {
    return (
    <div>
    {/* Import result is the URL of your image. */}
    <img src={cat} alt="Cat" />
    <div className='cat'></div>
    </div>
    );
    }
    export default Image;
    Now you’ll see the image displayed twice on the page!
    Phase 3: Updating the supported browsers (and its affect on code transpilation)
    Earlier you learned about the browerslist setting in the package.json file and now adjusting these targets affect how your code will be transpiled:
    {
      "browserslist": {
        "production": [
          ">0.2%",
          "not dead",
          "not op_mini all"
        ],
        "development": [
          "last 1 chrome version",
          "last 1 firefox version",
          "last 1 safari version"
        ]
      }
    }

The `production` list specifies the browsers to target when creating a production build and the `development` list specifics the browsers to target when running the application using `npm         start`. Currently, you’re targeting relatively recent versions of the major browsers when creating a development build. Targeting older browser versions results in your code being transpiled to an older version of JavaScript.

To experiment with this configuration option, let’s add a class component to the project. Add a new folder named `class-component` to the `src` folder. Within that folder, add a file named `ClassComponent.js` containing the following code:

    // ./src/class-component/ClassComponent.js
    import React from 'react';
    class ClassComponent extends React.Component {
    render() {
    return (
    <h1>Class Component</h1>
    );
    }
    }
    export default ClassComponent;
    Don’t forget to update your App component to render the new component:
    // ./src/App.js
    import React from 'react';
    import HeadingA from './css-modules/HeadingA';
    import HeadingB from './css-modules/HeadingB';
    import Image from './image/Image';
    import ClassComponent from './class-component/ClassComponent';
    function App() {
    return (
    <div>
    <h1>Exploring React Builds</h1>
    <HeadingA />
    <HeadingB />
    <Image />
    <ClassComponent />
    </div>
    );
    }
    export default App;
    Now run your application using npm start. Open your browser’s developer tools and view the “Sources” for the current page. Expand the localhost:3000 > static > js node on the left and select the main.chunk.js file. Press CMD+F on macOS or CTRL+F on Windows to search the file for “Class Component”. Here’s what the transpiled code looks like for the ClassComponent class:
    class ClassComponent extends react__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_0___default.a.Component {
      render() {
        return /*#__PURE__*/react__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_0___default.a.createElement("h1", {
          __self: this,
          __source: {
            fileName: _jsxFileName,
            lineNumber: 7,
            columnNumber: 7
          }
        }, "Class Component");
      }
    }

> *Have you wondered yet why you need to use the developer tools to view the bundles generated by Create React App? Remember that when you run* `npm start`*, Create React App builds your application using* `webpack-dev-server`*. To keep things as performant as possible, the bundles generated by* `webpack-dev-server` *are stored in memory instead of writing them to the file system.*

The JSX in the component’s `render` method has been converted to JavaScript but the `ClassComponent` ES2015 class is left alone. This makes sense though as JSX isn’t natively supported by any browser while ES2015 classes have been natively supported by browsers for awhile now.

But what if you need to target a version of a browser that doesn’t support ES2015 classes? You can use the <a href="https://caniuse.com/#feat=es6-class" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">“Can I use…”</a> website to see when browsers started supporting ES2105 (or ES6) classes. Starting with version 49, Chrome natively supported classes. But imagine that you need to support Chrome going back to version 30, a version of Chrome that doesn’t support classes.

Change the `browserslist.development` property in the `package.json` file to this:

    {
      "browserslist": {
        "production": [
          ">0.2%",
          "not dead",
          "not op_mini all"
        ],
        "development": [
          "chrome >= 30",
          "last 1 firefox version",
          "last 1 safari version"
        ]
      }
    }

The query `chrome >= 30` specifies that you want to target Chrome version 30 or newer.

> *The* <a href="https://browserl.ist/" class="markup--anchor markup--blockquote-anchor"><em>browserl.ist</em></a> *website can be used to see the browsers supported by your configured* `browserslist`*.*

Stop your application if it’s currently running. Delete the `./node_modules/.cache` folder and run `npm start` again. Then view the `main.chunk.js` bundle again in the developer tools:

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*TKBUkpbL5aSm5PTQ" class="graf-image" /></figure>Now your ES2015 class component is being converted to a constructor function! Here’s the transpiled code for reference:

    var ClassComponent = /*#__PURE__*/function (_React$Component) {
      Object(_Users_jameschurchill_Documents_GitHub_Modular_Curriculum_content_react_redux_topics_react_builds_projects_exploring_react_builds_solution_node_modules_babel_preset_react_app_node_modules_babel_runtime_helpers_esm_inherits__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_2__["default"])(ClassComponent, _React$Component);
    var super = Object(Users_jameschurchill_Documents_GitHub_Modular_Curriculum_content_react_redux_topics_react_builds_projects_exploring_react_builds_solution_node_modules_babel_preset_react_app_node_modules_babel_runtime_helpers_esm_createSuper__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_3["default"])(ClassComponent);
    function ClassComponent() {
    Object(Users_jameschurchill_Documents_GitHub_Modular_Curriculum_content_react_redux_topics_react_builds_projects_exploring_react_builds_solution_node_modules_babel_preset_react_app_node_modules_babel_runtime_helpers_esm_classCallCheck__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_0_["default"])(this, ClassComponent);
    return _super.apply(this, arguments);

    }
    Object(Users_jameschurchill_Documents_GitHub_Modular_Curriculum_content_react_redux_topics_react_builds_projects_exploring_react_builds_solution_node_modules_babel_preset_react_app_node_modules_babel_runtime_helpers_esm_createClass__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_1_["default"])(ClassComponent, [{
    key: "render",
    value: function render() {
    return /#PURE/react__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_4___default.a.createElement("h1", {
    __self: this,
    __source: {
    fileName: _jsxFileName,
    lineNumber: 7,
    columnNumber: 7
    }
    }, "Class Component");
    }
    }]);
    return ClassComponent;

    }(react__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_4___default.a.Component);
    Luckily it’s very rare that you’ll need to read the code in your generated bundles. webpack, by default, is configured to generate sourcemaps. Sourcemaps are a mapping of the code in a generated file, like a bundle file, to the original source code. This gives you access to your original source code in the browser’s developer tools:
    You can even set a breakpoint in your source within the developer tools to stop execution on a specific line of code!
    Phase 4: Adding environment variables
    Earlier you learned that Create React App supports defining environment variables in an .env file. This gives you a convenient way to avoid hard coding values that vary across environments.
    Let’s experiment with this feature so that you can see how the Create React App build process embeds environment variables into your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript bundles.
    Add an .env file to the root of your Create React App project. Define an environment variable named REACT_APP_TITLE:
    REACT_APP_TITLE=Exploring React Builds

Remember that environment variables need to be prefixed with `REACT_APP_` for Create React App to process them. After defining your environment variable, you can refer to it within JSX using an expression and `process.env`:

    // ./src/App.js
    import React from 'react';
    import HeadingA from './css-modules/HeadingA';
    import HeadingB from './css-modules/HeadingB';
    import Image from './image/Image';
    import ClassComponent from './class-component/ClassComponent';
    function App() {
    return (
    <div>
    <h1>{process.env.REACT_APP_TITLE}</h1>
    <HeadingA />
    <HeadingB />
    <Image />
    <ClassComponent />
    </div>
    );
    }
    export default App;
    Environment variables can also be referred to in regular JavaScript code:
    console.log(process.env.REACT_APP_TITLE);

You can also reference environment variables in your `./public/index.html` file like this:

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
      <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8" />
        <title>%REACT_APP_TITLE%</title>
      </head>
      <body>
        <div id="root"></div>
      </body>
    </html>

Run your application again using `npm start`. Open your browser’s developer tools and view the “Sources” for the current page. Expand the `localhost:3000` node on the left and select `(index)`. Notice that the text `%REACT_APP_TITLE%` within the `<title>` element has been converted to the text literal `Exploring React Builds`:

If you expand the `localhost:3000` &gt; `static` &gt; `js` node on the left and select the `main.chunk.js` file, you can see how the `App` component’s JSX has been converted to JavaScript:

Here’s a closer look at the relevant `React.createElement` method call:

    /*#__PURE__*/react__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_0___default.a.createElement("h1", {
        __self: this,
        __source: {
          fileName: _jsxFileName,
          lineNumber: 10,
          columnNumber: 7
        }
      }, "Exploring React Builds")

Again, notice how the environment variable has been replaced with a text literal. This has important security implications for you to consider. Because environment variables are embedded into your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript bundles during the build process, it’s *very important* to not store any secrets, like API keys, in your environment variables. Remember, anyone can view your bundled code in the browser by inspecting your files!

### Phase 5: Deploying a production build

In the last phase of this project, let’s add routing to the React application, create a production build, and deploy the build to an Express application!

### Adding routing

To add React Router to the application, start by installing the `react-router-dom` npm package:

    npm install react-router-dom@^5.0.0

Then update the `App` component to this code:

    // ./src/App.js
    import React from 'react';
    import {
    BrowserRouter,
    Switch,
    Route,
    Link
    } from 'react-router-dom';
    import HeadingA from './css-modules/HeadingA';
    import HeadingB from './css-modules/HeadingB';
    import Image from './image/Image';
    import ClassComponent from './class-component/ClassComponent';
    function App() {
    return (
    <BrowserRouter>
    <div>
    <h1>{process.env.REACT_APP_TITLE}</h1>
    <nav>
    <ul>
    <li>
    <Link to="/">Home</Link>
    </li>
    <li>
    <Link to="/image">Image</Link>
    </li>
    <li>
    <Link to="/class-component">Class Component</Link>
    </li>
    </ul>
    </nav>
    <Switch>
    <Route path="/image">
    <Image />
    </Route>
    <Route path="/class-component">
    <ClassComponent />
    </Route>
    <Route path="/">
    <HeadingA />
    <HeadingB />
    </Route>
    </Switch>
    </div>
    </BrowserRouter>
    );
    }
    export default App;
    Be sure to run and test your application to ensure that the defined routes work as expected:

    / - Should display the HeadingA and HeadingB components;
    /image - Should display the Image component; and
    /class-component - Should display the ClassComponent component.

    Creating a production build
    To create a production build, run the command npm run build from the root of your project. The output in the terminal should look something like this:
    > solution@0.1.0 build [absolute path to your project]
    > react-scripts build
    Creating an optimized production build...
    Compiled successfully.
    File sizes after gzip:
    47.83 KB  build/static/js/2.722c16c4.chunk.js
    773 B     build/static/js/runtime-main.b7d1e5ee.js
    745 B     build/static/js/main.12299197.chunk.js
    197 B     build/static/css/main.e9a0d1f8.chunk.css
    The project was built assuming it is hosted at /.
    You can control this with the homepage field in your package.json.
    The build folder is ready to be deployed.
    You may serve it with a static server:
    npm install -g serve
    serve -s build
    Find out more about deployment here:
    bit.ly/CRA-deploy
    Ignore the comments about using serve to deploy your application (i.e. npm install -g serve and serve -s build). In the next step, you’ll create a simple Express application to server your React application.
    Serving a React application using Express
    Create a new folder for your Express application outside of the Create React App project folder.

    For example, from the root of your project, use cd .. to go up a level and then create a new folder named express-server by running the command mkdir express-server. This makes the express-server folder a sibling to your Create React App project folder.

    Browse into the express-server folder and initialize it to use npm (i.e. npm init -y). Then install Express by running the command npm install express@^4.0.0.
    App a file named app.js with the following contents:
    // ./app.js
    const express = require('express');
    const path = require('path');
    const app = express();
    app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')));
    app.get('*', function(req, res) {
    res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, 'public', 'index.html'));
    });
    const port = 9000;
    app.listen(port, () => console.log(Listening on port ${port}...));
    This simple Express application will:

    Attempt to match incoming requests to static files located in the public folder; and
    If a matching static file isn’t found, then the ./public/index.html file will be served for all other requests.

    Now add a folder named public to the root of your Express project. Copy the files from the build folder in your Create React App project to the public folder in the Express application project. Then run your application using the command node app.js.
    Open a browser and browse to the URL http://localhost:9000/. You should see your React application served from your Express application! Be sure to click the navigation links to verify that all of your configured routes work as expected.
    Also, because you configured Express to serve the ./public/index.html file for any request that doesn’t match a static file, you can “deep link” to any of your React application’s routes:

    http://localhost:9000/image
    http://localhost:9000/class-component

    A Quick Guide to Big-O Notation, Memoization, Tabulation, and Sorting Algorithms by Example
    Curating Complexity: A Guide to Big-O Notation

    A Quick Guide to Big-O Notation, Memoization, Tabulation, and Sorting Algorithms by Example



    Curating Complexity: A Guide to Big-O Notation
    Medium-article-comp-complex
     A Node.js repl by bgoonzreplit.com

    Why is looking at runtime not a reliable method of calculating time complexity?
    Not all computers are made equal( some may be stronger and therefore boost our runtime speed )
    How many background processes ran concurrently with our program that was being tested?
    We also need to ask if our code remains performant if we increase the size of the input.
    The real question we need to answering is: How does our performance scale?.

    big ‘O’ notation

    Big O Notation is a tool for describing the efficiency of algorithms with respect to the size of the input arguments.
    Since we use mathematical functions in Big-O, there are a few big picture ideas that we’ll want to keep in mind:
    The function should be defined by the size of the input.
    Smaller Big O is better (lower time complexity)
    Big O is used to describe the worst case scenario.
    Big O is simplified to show only its most dominant mathematical term.

    Simplifying Math Terms

    We can use the following rules to simplify the our Big O functions:
    Simplify Products : If the function is a product of many terms, we drop the terms that don’t depend on n.
    Simplify Sums : If the function is a sum of many terms, we drop the non-dominant terms.
    n : size of the input
    T(f) : unsimplified math function
    O(f) : simplified math function.

    Putting it all together




    First we apply the product rule to drop all constants.
    Then we apply the sum rule to select the single most dominant term.


    Complexity Classes
    Common Complexity Classes
    There are 7 major classes in Time Complexity



    O(1) Constant

    The algorithm takes roughly the same number of steps for any input size.

    O(log(n)) Logarithmic

    In most cases our hidden base of Logarithmic time is 2, log complexity algorithm’s will typically display ‘halving’ the size of the input (like binary search!)

    O(n) Linear

    Linear algorithm’s will access each item of the input “once”.

    O(nlog(n)) Log Linear Time

    Combination of linear and logarithmic behavior, we will see features from both classes.


    Algorithm’s that are log-linear will use both recursion AND iteration.

    O(nc) Polynomial

    C is a fixed constant.

    O(c^n) Exponential

    C is now the number of recursive calls made in each stack frame.


    Algorithm’s with exponential time are VERY SLOW.


    Memoization

    Memoization : a design pattern used to reduce the overall number of calculations that can occur in algorithms that use recursive strategies to solve.
    MZ stores the results of the sub-problems in some other data structure, so that we can avoid duplicate calculations and only ‘solve’ each problem once.
    Two features that comprise memoization:


    FUNCTION MUST BE RECURSIVE.
    Our additional Data Structure is usually an object (we refer to it as our memo… or sometimes cache!)







    Memoizing Factorial
    Our memo object is mapping out our arguments of factorial to it’s return value.

    Keep in mind we didn’t improve the speed of our algorithm.

    Memoizing Fibonacci




    Our time complexity for Fibonacci goes from O(2^n) to O(n) after applying memoization.

    The Memoization Formula

    Rules:


    Write the unoptimized brute force recursion (make sure it works);
    Add memo object as an additional argument .
    Add a base case condition that returns the stored value if the function’s argument is in the memo.
    Before returning the result of the recursive case, store it in the memo as a value and make the function’s argument it’s key.

    Things to remember

    When solving DP problems with Memoization, it is helpful to draw out the visual tree first.
    When you notice duplicate sub-tree’s that means we can memoize.


    Tabulation
    Tabulation Strategy

    Use When:


    The function is iterative and not recursive.
    The accompanying DS is usually an array.

    Steps for tabulation

    Create a table array based off the size of the input.
    Initialize some values in the table to ‘answer’ the trivially small subproblem.
    Iterate through the array and fill in the remaining entries.
    Your final answer is usually the last entry in the table.


    Memo and Tab Demo with Fibonacci

    Normal Recursive Fibonacci

    function fibonacci(n) {
      if (n <= 2) return 1;
      return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
    }

> *Memoization Fibonacci 1*

> *Memoization Fibonacci 2*

> *Tabulated Fibonacci*

-   <span id="30dc">*Meaning: If it doesn’t exist then our for loop would run until the end therefore making our time complexity O(n).*</span>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Sorting Algorithms

### Bubble Sort

`Time Complexity`: Quadratic O(n^2)

-   <span id="ce1e">The inner for-loop contributes to O(n), however in a worst case scenario the while loop will need to run n times before bringing all n elements to their final resting spot.</span>

`Space Complexity`: O(1)

-   <span id="664f">Bubble Sort will always use the same amount of memory regardless of n.</span>

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*Ck9aeGY-d5tbz7dT" class="graf-image" /></figure>-   <span id="4115">The first major sorting algorithm one learns in introductory programming courses.</span>
-   <span id="ecd4">Gives an intro on how to convert unsorted data into sorted data.</span>

> It’s almost never used in production code because:

-   <span id="3cb1">*It’s not efficient*</span>
-   <span id="4eac">*It’s not commonly used*</span>
-   <span id="d730">*There is stigma attached to it*</span>
-   <span id="8da7">`Bubbling Up`* : Term that infers that an item is in motion, moving in some direction, and has some final resting destination.*</span>
-   <span id="8447">*Bubble sort, sorts an array of integers by bubbling the largest integer to the top.*</span>

<!-- -->

-   <span id="dcd2">*Worst Case & Best Case are always the same because it makes nested loops.*</span>
-   <span id="9a6a">*Double for loops are polynomial time complexity or more specifically in this case Quadratic (Big O) of: O(n²)*</span>

### Selection Sort

`Time Complexity`: Quadratic O(n^2)

-   <span id="646d">Our outer loop will contribute O(n) while the inner loop will contribute O(n / 2) on average. Because our loops are nested we will get O(n²);</span>

`Space Complexity`: O(1)

-   <span id="45ae">Selection Sort will always use the same amount of memory regardless of n.</span>

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*AByxtBjFrPVVYmyu" class="graf-image" /></figure>-   <span id="c618">Selection sort organizes the smallest elements to the start of the array.</span>

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*GeYNxlRcbt2cf0rY" class="graf-image" /></figure>Summary of how Selection Sort should work:

1.  <span id="2277">*Set MIN to location 0*</span>
2.  <span id="c76c">*Search the minimum element in the list.*</span>
3.  <span id="79d3">*Swap with value at location Min*</span>
4.  <span id="4ede">*Increment Min to point to next element.*</span>
5.  <span id="a649">*Repeat until list is sorted.*</span>

### Insertion Sort

`Time Complexity`: Quadratic O(n^2)

-   <span id="95ea">Our outer loop will contribute O(n) while the inner loop will contribute O(n / 2) on average. Because our loops are nested we will get O(n²);</span>

`Space Complexity`: O(n)

-   <span id="f6fa">Because we are creating a subArray for each element in the original input, our Space Comlexity becomes linear.</span>

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*gbNU6wrszGPrfAZG" class="graf-image" /></figure>### Merge Sort

`Time Complexity`: Log Linear O(nlog(n))

-   <span id="44b2">Since our array gets split in half every single time we contribute O(log(n)). The while loop contained in our helper merge function contributes O(n) therefore our time complexity is O(nlog(n)); `Space Complexity`: O(n)</span>
-   <span id="9a83">We are linear O(n) time because we are creating subArrays.</span>

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*GeU8YwwCoK8GiSTD" class="graf-image" /></figure><figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*IxqGb72XDVDeeiMl" class="graf-image" /></figure>### Example of Merge Sort

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*HMCR--9niDt5zY6M" class="graf-image" /></figure>-   <span id="48b4">**Merge sort is O(nlog(n)) time.**</span>
-   <span id="c598">*We need a function for merging and a function for sorting.*</span>

> Steps:

1.  <span id="213f">*If there is only one element in the list, it is already sorted; return the array.*</span>
2.  <span id="6214">*Otherwise, divide the list recursively into two halves until it can no longer be divided.*</span>
3.  <span id="3cc8">*Merge the smallest lists into new list in a sorted order.*</span>

### Quick Sort

`Time Complexity`: Quadratic O(n^2)

-   <span id="8e34">Even though the average time complexity O(nLog(n)), the worst case scenario is always quadratic.</span>

`Space Complexity`: O(n)

-   <span id="626b">Our space complexity is linear O(n) because of the partition arrays we create.</span>
-   <span id="7e3a">QS is another Divide and Conquer strategy.</span>
-   <span id="233d">Some key ideas to keep in mind:</span>
-   <span id="1173">It is easy to sort elements of an array relative to a particular target value.</span>
-   <span id="8634">An array of 0 or 1 elements is already trivially sorted.</span>

`Time Complexity`: Log Time O(log(n))

`Space Complexity`: O(1)

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*-naVYGTXzE2Yoali" class="graf-image" /></figure>*Recursive Solution*

> *Min Max Solution*

-   <span id="6fb1">*Must be conducted on a sorted array.*</span>
-   <span id="383b">*Binary search is logarithmic time, not exponential b/c n is cut down by two, not growing.*</span>
-   <span id="c940">*Binary Search is part of Divide and Conquer.*</span>

### Insertion Sort

-   <span id="26b7">**Works by building a larger and larger sorted region at the left-most end of the array.**</span>

> Steps:

1.  <span id="8c1f">*If it is the first element, and it is already sorted; return 1.*</span>
2.  <span id="1451">*Pick next element.*</span>
3.  <span id="0f8b">*Compare with all elements in the sorted sub list*</span>
4.  <span id="4d78">*Shift all the elements in the sorted sub list that is greater than the value to be sorted.*</span>
5.  <span id="9131">*Insert the value*</span>
6.  <span id="6c8a">*Repeat until list is sorted.*</span>

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*lte81mEvgEPYXodB.png" class="graf-image" /></figure>-   <span id="28b6">way we analyze how efficient algorithms are without getting too mired in details</span>
-   <span id="4141">can model how much time any function will take given `n` inputs</span>
-   <span id="9479">interested in order of magnitude of number of the exact figure</span>
-   <span id="8fe1">O absorbs all fluff and n = biggest term</span>
-   <span id="a9c8">Big O of `3x^2 +x + 1` = `O(n^2)`</span>

### Time Complexity

no loops or exit & return = O(1)

0 nested loops = `O(n)`  
1 nested loops = `O(n^2)`  
2 nested loops = `O(n^3)`  
3 nested loops = `O(n^4)`

**recursive**: as you add more terms, increase in time as you add input diminishes  
**recursion**: when you define something in terms of itself, a function that calls itself

-   <span id="f455">used because of ability to maintain state at diffferent levels of recursion</span>
-   <span id="f168">inherently carries large footprint</span>
-   <span id="5510">every time function called, you add call to stack</span>

**iterative**: use loops instead of recursion (preferred)  
- favor readability over performance

`O(n log(n))` & `O(log(n))`: dividing/halving

-   <span id="4f7e">if code employs recursion/divide-and-conquer strategy</span>
-   <span id="d1cc">what power do i need to power my base to get n</span>

### Time Definitions

-   <span id="9aad">**constant**: does not scale with input, will take same amount of time</span>
-   <span id="3a19">for any input size n, constant time performs same number of operations every time</span>
-   <span id="bf51">**logarithmic**: increases number of operations it performs as logarithmic function of input size n</span>
-   <span id="93d5">function log n grows very slowly, so as n gets longer, number of operations the algorithm needs to perform doesn’t increase very much</span>
-   <span id="a2cf">halving</span>
-   <span id="46c0">**linear**: increases number of operations it performs as linear function of input size n</span>
-   <span id="5f16">number of additional operations needed to perform grows in direct proportion to increase in input size n</span>
-   <span id="ab93">**log-linear**: increases number of operations it performs as log-linear function of input size n</span>
-   <span id="0459">looking over every element and doing work on each one</span>
-   <span id="bd8a">**quadratic**: increases number of operations it performs as quadratic function of input size n</span>
-   <span id="dc41">**exponential**: increases number of operations it performs as exponential function of input size n</span>
-   <span id="71fc">number of nested loops increases as function of n</span>
-   <span id="8253">**polynomial**: as size of input increases, runtime/space used will grow at a faster rate</span>
-   <span id="8827">**factorial**: as size of input increases, runtime/space used will grow astronomically even with relatively small inputs</span>
-   <span id="040c">**rate of growth**: how fast a function grows with input size</span>

-   <span id="403b">How does the space usage scale/change as input gets very large?</span>
-   <span id="5f20">What auxiliary space does your algorithm use or is it in place (constant)?</span>
-   <span id="b207">Runtime stack space counts as part of space complexity unless told otherwise.</span>

### Absolutely Everything You Could Need To Know About How JavaScript Works.

#### Seriously… this list is utterly exhaustive it covers more core concepts than I can hold the names of in working memory on a very good day.

#### But first a little bit of mildly shameful self promotion:

> (self promotion ends after the line denoted by a bunch of pictures of my dog🐕 )

> (Followed by a brief introduction to JavaScript for beginners)

> (Finally the main content / resources / imbedded YouTube links)

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/0*iHxLNzz1MOZACC5u.png" class="graf-image" /></figure>### The Number Data Type

The **number** data type in JS is used to represent any numerical  
values, including integers and decimal numbers. **Basic Arithmetic Operators** are the symbols that perform particular operations.

-   <span id="205d">**+** (addition)</span>
-   <span id="1df4">**-** (subtraction)</span>
-   <span id="f17b">**asterisk** (multiplication)</span>
-   <span id="ed52">**/** (division)</span>
-   <span id="d3a6">**%** (modulo)</span>

JS evaluates more complex expressions using the general math order of  
operations aka PEMDAS.

-   <span id="4923">**PEMDAS** : Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Modulo, Addition, Subtraction.</span>
-   <span id="e245">*To force a specific order of operation, use the group operator ( ) around a part of the expression.*</span>

**Modulo** : Very useful operation to check divisibility of numbers,  
check for even & odd, whether a number is prime, and much more!  
*(Discrete Math concept, circular problems can be solved with modulo)*

-   <span id="9608">Whenever you have a smaller number % a larger number, the answer will just be the initial small number.</span>
-   <span id="3b00">`console.log(7 % 10); // => 7;`</span>

### The String Data Type

The **string** data type is a primitive data type that used to represent  
textual data.

-   <span id="792d">can be wrapped by either **single** or **double** quotation marks, *best to choose one and stick with it for consistency*.</span>
-   <span id="4f91">If your string contains quotation marks inside, can layer single or double quotation marks to allow it to work.</span>

<!-- -->

    "That's a great string"; (valid)
    'Shakespeare wrote, "To be or not to be"'; (valid)
    'That's a bad string'; (invalid)

-   <span id="a54b">Alt. way to add other quotes within strings is to use template literals.</span>

### `This is a template literal`

`${function} // use ${} to invoke functions within.`

> **.length** : property that can be appended to data to return the length.

> empty strings have a length of zero.

> **indices** : indexes of data that begin at 0, can call upon index by using the bracket notation \[ \].

    console.log("bootcamp"[0]); // => "b"
    console.log("bootcamp"[10]); // => "undefined"
    console.log("boots"[1 * 2]); // => "o"
    console.log("boots"["boot".length - 1]); // => "t"

-   <span id="bcc3">we can pass expressions through the brackets as well since JS always evaluates expressions first.</span>
-   <span id="f60b">The index of the last character of a string is always one less than it’s length.</span>
-   <span id="5329">**indexOf()** : method used to find the first index of a given character within a string.</span>
-   <span id="6813">`console.log("bagel".indexOf("b")); // => 0             console.log("bagel".indexOf("z")); // => -1`</span>
-   <span id="262e">**if the character inside the indexOf() search does not exist in the string, the output will be -1.**</span>
-   <span id="0646">the indexOf() search will return the first instanced index of the the char in the string.</span>
-   <span id="15e0">**concatenate** : word to describe joining strings together into a single string.</span>

### The Boolean Data Type

The **Boolean** data type is the simplest data type since there are only  
two values: **true** and **false**.

-   <span id="62d6">**Logical Operators** (Boolean Operators) are used to establish logic in our code.</span>
-   <span id="bae2">**!** (not) : reverses a Boolean value.</span>

`console.log(!true); // => false console.log(!!false); // => false`

-   <span id="71d9">**&&** (and) **Truth Table**</span>

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*Y4qzqSB0C-9AmtXf.png" class="graf-image" /></figure>-   <span id="c706">**Logical Order of Operations** : JS will evaluate !, then &&, then ||.</span>
-   <span id="1e21">**De Morgan’s Law** : Common mistake in Boolean logic is incorrectly distributing ! across parentheses.</span>
-   <span id="2e3e">`!(A || B) === !A && !B; !(A && B) === !A             || !B;`</span>
-   <span id="350f">In summary, to correctly distribute ! across parentheses we must also flip the operation within.</span>

### Comparison Operators

All comparison operators will result in a Boolean output.

**The relative comparators**

-   <span id="0d1c">**&gt;** (greater than)</span>
-   <span id="77dd">**&lt;** (less than)</span>
-   <span id="2041">**&gt;=** (greater than or equal to)</span>
-   <span id="55fd">**&lt;=** (less than or equal to)</span>
-   <span id="1b7c">**===** (equal to)</span>
-   <span id="09a6">**!==** (not equal to)</span>

> Fun Fact: “a” &lt; “b” is considered valid JS Code because string  
> comparisons are compared lexicographically (meaning dictionary order),  
> so “a” is less than “b” because it appears earlier!

> If there is ever a standstill comparison of two string  
> lexicographically (i.e. app vs apple) the comparison will deem the  
> shorter string lesser.

**Difference between == and ===**

-   <span id="3fec">**===** : Strict Equality, will only return true if the two comparisons are entirely the same.</span>
-   <span id="224d">**==** : Loose Equality, will return true even if the values are of a different type, due to coercion. (Avoid using this)</span>

### Variables

Variables are used to store information to be referenced and manipulated  
in a program.

-   <span id="e084">We initialize a variable by using the **let** keyword and a **=** single equals sign (assignment operator).</span>
-   <span id="92ec">`let bootcamp = "Lambda"; console.log(bootcamp); //             "Lambda"`</span>
-   <span id="f5af">JS variable names can contain any alphanumeric characters,  
    underscores, or dollar signs (cannot being with a number).</span>
-   <span id="5288">If you do not declare a value for a variable, undefined is  
    automatically set.</span>
-   <span id="5f49">`let bootcamp; console.log(bootcamp); // undefined`</span>
-   <span id="ea4b">We can change the value of a previously declared variable (let, not  
    const) by re-assigning it another value.</span>
-   <span id="ef75">**let** is the updated version of **var**; there are some  
    differences in terms of hoisting and global/block scope — will be  
    covered later in the course (common interview question!)</span>

-   <span id="7ff5">In general, any nonsensical arithmetic will result in **NaN** ; usually operations that include undefined.</span>

### Functions

A function is a procedure of code that will run when called. Functions  
are used so that we do not have to rewrite code to do the same thing  
over and over. (Think of them as ‘subprograms’)

-   <span id="01bb">**Function Declaration** : Process when we first initially write our function.</span>
-   <span id="963b">Includes three things:</span>
-   <span id="32df">Name of the function.</span>
-   <span id="7930">A list of *parameters* ()</span>
-   <span id="145e">The code to execute {}</span>
-   <span id="37c0">**Function Calls** : We can call upon our function whenever and wherever\* we want. (\*wherever is only after the initial declaration)</span>
-   <span id="f3cc">JS evaluates code top down, left to right.</span>
-   <span id="cf9c">When we execute a declared function later on in our program we refer to this as **invoking** our function.</span>
-   <span id="4374">Every function in JS returns undefined unless otherwise specified.</span>
-   <span id="3bb7">When we hit a **return** statement in a function we immediately exit the function and return to where we called the function.</span>
-   <span id="0ce8">When naming functions in JS always use camelCase and name it something appropriate. &gt; Great code reads like English and almost explains itself. Think: Elegant, readable, and maintainable!</span>

### Parameters and Arguments

-   <span id="38d3">**Parameters** : Comma separated variables specified as part of a function’s declaration.</span>
-   <span id="ecef">**Arguments** : Values passed to the function when it is invoked.</span>
-   <span id="a836">*If the number of arguments passed during a function invocation is different than the number of parameters listed, it will still work.*</span>
-   <span id="a53a">However, is there are not enough arguments provided for parameters our function will likely yield **Nan**.</span>

### Dependent on data

> *Something that data structure and algorithms have in common when talking about time complexity is that they are both dealing with data. When you deal with data you become dependent on them and as a result the time complexity is also dependent of the data that you received. To solve this problem we talk about 3 different time complexity.*

-   <span id="bc8d">**The best-case complexity: when the data looks the best**</span>
-   <span id="8b06">**The worst-case complexity: when the data looks the worst**</span>
-   <span id="881c">**The average-case complexity: when the data looks average**</span>

### Big O notation

The complexity is usually expressed with the Big O notation. The wikipedia page about this subject is pretty complex but you can find here a good summary of the different complexity for the most famous data structures and sorting algorithms.

### The Array data structure

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*Qk3UYgeqXamRrFLR.gif" class="graf-image" /></figure>### Definition

An Array data structure, or simply an Array, is a data structure consisting of a collection of elements (values or variables), each identified by at least one array index or key. The simplest type of data structure is a linear array, also called one-dimensional array. From Wikipedia

Arrays are among the oldest and most important data structures and are used by every program. They are also used to implement many other data structures.

### <a href="https://javascript.info/primitives-methods#a-primitive-as-an-object" class="markup--anchor markup--h3-anchor">A primitive as an object</a>

Here’s the paradox faced by the creator of JavaScript:

-   <span id="95d1">There are many things one would want to do with a primitive like a string or a number. It would be great to access them using methods.</span>
-   <span id="10fe">Primitives must be as fast and lightweight as possible.</span>

The solution looks a little bit awkward, but here it is:

1.  <span id="4506">Primitives are still primitive. A single value, as desired.</span>
2.  <span id="7880">The language allows access to methods and properties of strings, numbers, booleans and symbols.</span>
3.  <span id="be72">In order for that to work, a special “object wrapper” that provides the extra functionality is created, and then is destroyed.</span>

The “object wrappers” are different for each primitive type and are called: `String`, `Number`, `Boolean` and `Symbol`. Thus, they provide different sets of methods.

For instance, there exists a string method <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/toUpperCase" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">str.toUpperCase()</a> that returns a capitalized `str`.

Here’s how it works:

    let str = "Hello";
    alert( str.toUpperCase() ); // HELLO
    Simple, right? Here’s what actually happens in str.toUpperCase():

    The string str is a primitive. So in the moment of accessing its property, a special object is created that knows the value of the string, and has useful methods, like toUpperCase().
    That method runs and returns a new string (shown by alert).
    The special object is destroyed, leaving the primitive str alone.

    So primitives can provide methods, but they still remain lightweight.
    The JavaScript engine highly optimizes this process. It may even skip the creation of the extra object at all. But it must still adhere to the specification and behave as if it creates one.

    An Introduction to Markdown (Bonus Markdown Templates Included)
    Basic Syntax Guide

    An Introduction to Markdown (Bonus Markdown Templates Included)



    bgoonz/Markdown-Templates
     One Paragraph of project description goes here These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on…github.com
    Basic Syntax Guide
    This topic is meant to give you a very basic overview of how Markdown works, showing only some of the most common operations you use most frequently. Keep in mind that you can also use the Edit menus to inject markdown using the toolbar, which serves as a great way to see how Markdown works. However, Markdown’s greatest strength lies in its simplicity and keyboard friendly approach that lets you focus on writing your text and staying on the keyboard.
    What is Markdown
    Markdown is very easy to learn and get comfortable with due it’s relatively small set of markup ‘commands’. It uses already familiar syntax to represent common formatting operations. Markdown understands basic line breaks so you can generally just type text.
    Markdown also allows for raw HTML inside of a markdown document, so if you want to embed something more fancy than what Markdowns syntax can do you can always fall back to HTML. However to keep documents readable that’s generally not recommended.
    Basic Markdown Syntax
    The following are a few examples of the most common things you are likely to do with Markdown while building typical documentation.
    Bold and Italic
    markdown
    This text is bold.

    This text is italic.
    This text is bold.

    This text is italic.
    Header Text
    markdown
    Header 1
    Header 2
    Header 3
    Header 4
    Header 5
    Header 6
    Header 1
    Header 2
    Header 3
    Header 4
    Header 5Header 6
    Line Continuation
    By default Markdown adds paragraphs at double line breaks. Single line breaks by themselves are simply wrapped together into a single line. If you want to have soft returns that break a single line, add two spaces at the end of the line.
    markdown
    This line has a paragraph break at the end (empty line after).
    Theses two lines should display as a single
    line because there's no double space at the end.
    The following line has a soft break at the end (two spaces at end)

    This line should be following on the very next line.
    This line has a paragraph break at the end (empty line after).
    Theses two lines should display as a single line because there’s no double space at the end.
    The following line has a soft break at the end (two spaces at end)

    This line should be following on the very next line.
    Links
    markdown
    Help Builder Web Site
    Help Builder Web Site
    If you need additional image tags like targets or title attributes you can also embed HTML directly:
    markdown
    Go the Help Builder sitest Wind site: <a href="http://west-wind.com/" target="_blank">Help Builder Site</a>.
    Images
    markdown




    Block Quotes
    Block quotes are callouts that are great for adding notes or warnings into documentation.
    markdown
    > ###  Headers break on their own

    > Note that headers don't need line continuation characters

    as they are block elements and automatically break. Only text

    lines require the double spaces for single line breaks.

    Headers break on their own


    Note that headers don’t need line continuation characters as they are block elements and automatically break. Only text lines require the double spaces for single line breaks.

    Fontawesome Icons
    Help Builder includes a custom syntax for FontAwesome icons in its templates. You can embed a @ icon- followed by a font-awesome icon name to automatically embed that icon without full HTML syntax.
    markdown
    Gear:  Configuration
    Configuration
    HTML Markup
    You can also embed plain HTML markup into the page if you like. For example, if you want full control over fontawesome icons you can use this:
    markdown
    This text can be embedded into Markdown:

    <i class="fa fa-refresh fa-spin fa-lg"></i> Refresh Page
    This text can be embedded into Markdown:

     Refresh Page
    Unordered Lists
    markdown

    Item 1
    Item 2
    Item 3
    This text is part of the third item. Use two spaces at end of the the list item to break the line.

    A double line break, breaks out of the list.

    Item 1
    Item 2
    Item 3

    This text is part of the third item. Use two spaces at end of the the list item to break the line.

    A double line break, breaks out of the list.
    Ordered Lists
    markdown

    Item 1
    Item 1 is really something
    Item 2
    Item two is really something else

    If you want lines to break using soft returns use two spaces at the end of a line.

    Item 1 Item 1 is really something
    Item 2

    Item two is really something else

    If you want to lines to break using soft returns use to spaces at the end of a line.
    Inline Code
    If you want to embed code in the middle of a paragraph of text to highlight a coding syntax or class/member name you can use inline code syntax:
    markdown
    Structured statements like for x =1 to 10 loop structures

    can be codified using single back ticks.
    Structured statements like for x =1 to 10 loop structures can be codified using single back ticks.
    Code Blocks with Syntax Highlighting
    Markdown supports code blocks syntax in a variety of ways:
    markdown
    The following code demonstrates:
    // This is code by way of four leading spaces
    // or a leading tab

    More text here
    The following code demonstrates:
    pgsql
    // This is code by way of four leading spaces

    // or a leading tab
    More text here
    Code Blocks
    You can also use triple back ticks plus an optional coding language to support for syntax highlighting (space injected before last ` to avoid markdown parsing):
    markdown
    `csharp // this code will be syntax highlighted for(var i=0; i++; i &lt; 10) { Console.WriteLine(i); } `
    csharp
    // this code will be syntax highlighted

    for(var i=0; i++; i < 10)

    {

    Console.WriteLine(i);

    }
    Many languages are supported: html, xml, javascript, css, csharp, foxpro, vbnet, sql, python, ruby, php and many more. Use the Code drop down list to get a list of available languages.
    You can also leave out the language to get no syntax coloring but the code box:
    markdown
    `dos robocopy c:\temp\test d:\temp\test `
    dos
    robocopy c:\temp\test d:\temp\test
    To create a formatted block but without formatting use the txt format:
    markdown
    `txt This is some text that will not be syntax highlighted but shows up in a code box. `
    which gives you:
    text
    This is some text that will not be syntax highlighted

    but shows up in a code box.

    Array Callback Methods Implemented With For Loops
    How to implement array callback methods in JavaScript

    Array Callback Methods Implemented With For Loops
    How to implement array callback methods in JavaScript



    Functions are called “First Class Objects” in JavaScript because:

    A function is an instance of the Object type
    A function can have properties and has a link back to its constructor method
    You can store the function in a variable
    You can pass the function as a parameter to another function
    You can return the function from a function

    What do you think will be printed in the following:
    Anonymous callback, a named callback
    function foo(callback) {
        console.log('grape');
        callback();
    }
    function bar() {
    console.log('banana');
    }
    const fruitBasket = function() {
    console.log('apple');
    bar();
    foo(bar);
    foo(function() {
    console.log('orange');
    });
    console.log('pear');
    };
    fruitBasket();
    Function that takes in a value and two callbacks. The function should return the result of the callback who’s invocation results in a larger value.
    function greaterValue(value, cb1, cb2) {
        // compare cb1 invoked with value to cb2 invoked with value
        // return the greater result
    let res1 = cb1(value);
    let res2 = cb2(value);
    if (res1 &gt; res2) {
        // if this is false, we move out of if statement
        return res1;
    }
    return res2;

    }
    let negate = function(num) {
    return num * -1;
    };
    let addOne = function(num) {
    return num + 1;
    };
    console.log(greaterValue(3, negate, addOne));

    console.log(greaterValue(-2, negate, addOne));
    Note: we do not invoke negate or addOne (by using () to call them), we are passing the function itself.
    Write a function, myMap, that takes in an array and a callback as arguments. The function should mimic the behavior of Array.prototype.map.
    function myMap(arr, callback) {
        // iterate through the array, perform the cb on each element
        // return a new array with those new values
        let mapped = [];
    for (let i = 0; i &lt; arr.length; i++) {
        // remember that map passes three args with each element.
        let val = callback(arr[i], i, arr);
        mapped.push(val);
    }

    return mapped;

    }
    let double = function(num) {

    return num * 2;

    };

    console.log(myMap([1, 2, 3], double));
    Write a function, myFilter, that takes in an array and a callback as arguments. The function should mimic the behavior of Array.prototype.filter.
    function myFilter(arr, callback) {
        let filtered = [];
    for (let i = 0; i &lt; arr.length; i++) {
        let element = arr[i];

        if (callback(element, i, arr)) {
            filtered.push(element);
        }
    }

    return filtered;

    }
    Write a function, myEvery, that takes in an array and a callback as arguments. The function should mimic the behavior of Array.prototype.every.
    function myEvery(arr, callback) {
        for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            let element = arr[i];
        if (callback(element, i, arr) === false) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;

    }
    Further Examples of the above concepts
    const createMeowValue = () => {
      console.log(this.name);
      let meow = function () {
        console.log(this);
        console.log(this.name + ' meows');
      }
      meow = meow.bind(this);
      return meow;
    };
    const name = 'Fluffy';
    const cat = {
    name: name,
    age: 12,
    createMeow: function () {
    console.log(this.name);
    let meow = () => {
    const hello = 'hello';
    console.log(this.name + ' meows');
    };
    let world = '';
    if (true) {
    world = 'world';
    }
    console.log(world);
    // meow = meow.bind(this);
    return meow;
    }
    };
    cat.newKey = function () {
    const outermostContext = this;
    const innerFunc = () => {
    secondContext = this;
    console.log(secondContext === outermostContext)
    return function () {
    innermostContext = this;
    }
    };
    return innerFunc.bind(outermostContext);
    };
    const meow = cat.createMeow(); // method-style invocation
    meow(); // function-style invocation
    console.log('-------')
    const createMeow = cat.createMeow;
    const globalMeow = createMeow(); // function-style
    globalMeow(); // function-style
    function createSmoothie(ingredient) {
    const ingredients = [ingredient];
    return ingredients;
    }
    // console.log(createSmoothie('banana'));
    // console.log(createSmoothie('apple'));
    // one parameter only

    // first argument is a string

    // return an array

    // DO NOT USE forEach

### One Liners

### Block Bad IPs

Use iptables to block all bad ip addresses:

    $ cat /var/log/maillog | grep 'lost connection after AUTH from unknown' | tail -n 5
    May 10 11:19:49 srv4 postfix/smtpd[1486]: lost connection after AUTH from unknown[185.36.81.145]
    May 10 11:21:41 srv4 postfix/smtpd[1762]: lost connection after AUTH from unknown[185.36.81.164]
    May 10 11:21:56 srv4 postfix/smtpd[1762]: lost connection after AUTH from unknown[175.139.231.129]
    May 10 11:23:51 srv4 postfix/smtpd[1838]: lost connection after AUTH from unknown[185.211.245.170]
    May 10 11:24:02 srv4 postfix/smtpd[1838]: lost connection after AUTH from unknown[185.211.245.170]

Get the data to show only IPs:

    cat /var/log/maillog | grep 'lost connection after AUTH from unknown' | cut -d'[' -f3 | cut -d ']' -f1 | tail -n5
    185.36.81.164
    175.139.231.129
    185.211.245.170
    185.211.245.170
    185.36.81.173

Get the unique IP addresses:

    $ cat /var/log/maillog | grep 'lost connection after AUTH from unknown' | cut -d'[' -f3 | cut -d ']' -f1 | sort | uniq
    103.194.70.16
    112.196.77.202
    113.172.210.19
    113.173.182.119
    139.59.224.234

Redirect the output to iptables:

    $ for ip in $(cat /var/log/maillog | grep 'lost connection after AUTH from unknown' | cut -d'[' -f3 | cut -d ']' -f1 | sort | uniq); do iptables -I INPUT -s ${ip} -p tcp --dport 25 -j DROP; done

### If Statements

### Check if args are passed

    if [[ $# -eq 0 ]] ; then
        echo 'need to pass args'
        exit 0
    fi

### Check if required variables exist

    if [ $1 == "one" ] || [ $1 == "two" ]
    then
      echo "argument 1 has the value one or two"
      exit 0
    else
      echo "I require argument 1 to be one or two"
      exit 1
    fi

### Check if environment variables exists

    if [ -z ${OWNER} ] || [ -z ${NAME} ]
    then
      echo "does not meet requirements of both environment variables"
      exit 1
    else
      echo "required environment variables exists"
    fi

### While Loops

### Run process for 5 Seconds

    set -ex
    count=0
    echo "boot"
    ping localhost &
    while [ $count -le 5 ]
      do
        sleep 1
        count=$((count + 1))
        echo $count
      done
    ps aux | grep ping
    echo "tear down"
    kill $!
    sleep 2

### Redirecting Outputs

### Stdout, Stderr

Redirect stderr to /dev/null:

    grep -irl faker . 2>/dev/null

Redirect stdout to one file and stderr to another file:

    grep -irl faker . > out 2>error

Redirect stderr to stdout (&1), and then redirect stdout to a file:

    grep -irl faker . >out 2>&1

Redirect both to a file:

    grep -irl faker . &> file.log

Bash Commands That Save Me Time and Frustration
===============================================

Here’s a list of bash commands that stand between me and insanity.

### Bash Commands That Save Me Time and Frustration

#### Here’s a list of bash commands that stand between me and insanity.

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*w0J8u6jWTikYVZzW.jpg" class="graf-image" /></figure><a href="https://bryanguner.medium.com/a-list-of-all-of-my-articles-to-link-to-future-posts-1f6f88ebdf5b" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">https://bryanguner.medium.com/a-list-of-all-of-my-articles-to-link-to-future-posts-1f6f88ebdf5b</a>

> **This article will be accompanied by the following** <a href="https://github.com/bgoonz/bash-commands-walkthrough" class="markup--anchor markup--pullquote-anchor"><strong>github repository</strong></a> **which will contain all the commands listed as well as folders that demonstrate before and after usage!**

<a href="https://github.com/bgoonz/bash-commands-walkthrough" class="markup--anchor markup--mixtapeEmbed-anchor" title="https://github.com/bgoonz/bash-commands-walkthrough"><strong>bgoonz/bash-commands-walkthrough</strong><br />

> The <a href="https://github.com/bgoonz/bash-commands-walkthrough#readme" class="markup--anchor markup--pullquote-anchor">readme</a> for this git repo will provide a much more condensed list… whereas this article will break up the commands with explanations… images & links!

**I will include the code examples as both github gists (for proper syntax highlighting) and as code snippets adjacent to said gists so that they can easily be copied and pasted… or … if you’re like me for instance; and like to use an extension to grab the markdown content of a page… the code will be included rather than just a link to the gist!**

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*3m_UcQOAyKtIpHQ6j9JzZw.gif" class="graf-image" /></figure>### Here’s a Cheatsheet:

### Getting Started (Advanced Users Skip Section):

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### ✔ Check the Current Directory ➡ `pwd`:

On the command line, it’s important to know the directory we are currently working on. For that, we can use `pwd` command.

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*dimzLUrmDI4Ufev6.gif" class="graf-image" /></figure>It shows that I’m working on my Desktop directory.

#### ✔ Display List of Files ➡ `ls`:

To see the list of files and directories in the current directory use `ls` command in your CLI.

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*HHzVrK2CtTPwTdYT.gif" class="graf-image" /></figure>Shows all of my files and directories of my Desktop directory.

-   <span id="20cb">To show the contents of a directory pass the directory name to the `ls` command i.e. `ls directory_name`.</span>
-   <span id="5cd8">Some useful `ls` command options:-</span>

OptionDescriptionls -alist all files including hidden file starting with ‘.’ls -llist with the long formatls -lalist long format including hidden files

#### ✔ Create a Directory ➡ `mkdir`:

We can create a new folder using the `mkdir` command. To use it type `mkdir folder_name`.

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*m3dDyC9vRJBUZSxR.gif" class="graf-image" /></figure>Use `ls` command to see the directory is created or not.

I created a cli-practice directory in my working directory i.e. Desktop directory.

#### ✔ Move Between Directories ➡ `cd`:

It’s used to change directory or to move other directories. To use it type `cd directory_name`.

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*34KGxT2G8oNMDnIc.gif" class="graf-image" /></figure>Can use `pwd` command to confirm your directory name.

Changed my directory to the cli-practice directory. And the rest of the tutorial I’m gonna work within this directory.

#### ✔ Parent Directory ➡ `..`:

We have seen `cd` command to change directory but if we want to move back or want to move to the parent directory we can use a special symbol `..` after `cd` command, like `cd ..`

#### ✔ Create Files ➡ `touch`:

We can create an empty file by typing `touch file_name`. It’s going to create a new file in the current directory (the directory you are currently in) with your provided name.

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*xu1wtv7gJ2NMvP60.gif" class="graf-image" /></figure>I created a hello.txt file in my current working directory. Again you can use `ls` command to see the file is created or not.

Now open your hello.txt file in your text editor and write *Hello Everyone!* into your hello.txt file and save it.

#### ✔ Display the Content of a File ➡ `cat`:

We can display the content of a file using the `cat` command. To use it type `cat         file_name`.

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*iKf5w9QFNCeLRv8a.gif" class="graf-image" /></figure>Shows the content of my hello.txt file.

#### ✔ Move Files & Directories ➡ `mv`:

To move a file and directory, we use `mv` command.

By typing `mv file_to_move destination_directory`, you can move a file to the specified directory.

By entering `mv directory_to_move destination_directory`, you can move all the files and directories under that directory.

Before using this command, we are going to create two more directories and another txt file in our cli-practice directory.

`mkdir html css touch bye.txt`

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*piaAQz_MQpzo7DPH.gif" class="graf-image" /></figure>Yes, we can use multiple directories & files names one after another to create multiple directories & files in one command.

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*5jmj_ZyNz46GuQKz.gif" class="graf-image" /></figure>Moved my bye.txt file into my css directory and then moved my css directory into my html directory.

#### ✔ Rename Files & Directories ➡ `mv`:

`mv` command can also be used to rename a file and a directory.

You can rename a file by typing `mv old_file_name new_file_name` & also rename a directory by typing `mv old_directory_name new_directory_name`.

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*WTVu1dd6gr-nmWhD.gif" class="graf-image" /></figure>Renamed my hello.txt file to the hi.txt file and html directory to the folder directory.

#### ✔ Copy Files & Directories ➡ `cp`:

To do this, we use the `cp` command.

-   <span id="62fa">You can copy a file by entering `cp file_to_copy new_file_name`.</span>

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*kCLVtKN9oKPbHfRF.gif" class="graf-image" /></figure>Copied my hi.txt file content into hello.txt file. For confirmation open your hello.txt file in your text editor.

-   <span id="9bfc">You can also copy a directory by adding the `-r` option, like `cp -r             directory_to_copy new_directory_name`.</span>

*The* `-r` *option for “recursive” means that it will copy all of the files including the files inside of subfolders.*

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*MnmzMiioIYCuK92B.gif" class="graf-image" /></figure>Here I copied all of the files from the folder to folder-copy.

#### ✔ Remove Files & Directories ➡ `rm`:

To do this, we use the `rm` command.

-   <span id="487a">To remove a file, you can use the command like `rm file_to_remove`.</span>

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*ohCmdthd92_HA6Ze.gif" class="graf-image" /></figure>Here I removed my hi.txt file.

-   <span id="0e9a">To remove a directory, use the command like `rm -r directory_to_remove`.</span>

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*voDbzwSpw24A2RjQ.gif" class="graf-image" /></figure>I removed my folder-copy directory from my cli-practice directory i.e. current working directory.

#### ✔ Clear Screen ➡ `clear`:

Clear command is used to clear the terminal screen.

#### ✔ Home Directory ➡ `~`:

The Home directory is represented by `~`. The Home directory refers to the base directory for the user. If we want to move to the Home directory we can use `cd ~` command. Or we can only use `cd` command.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### MY COMMANDS:

### 1.) Recursively unzip zip files and then delete the archives when finished:

**here is a** <a href="https://github.com/bgoonz/bash-commands-walkthrough/tree/master/steps/1-recursive-unzip" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor"><strong>folde</strong></a>**r containing the before and after… I had to change folder names slightly due to a limit on the length of file-paths in a github repo.**

    find . -name "*.zip" | while read filename; do unzip -o -d "`dirname "$filename"`" "$filename"; done;    
    find . -name "*.zip" -type f -print -delete

    2.) Install node modules recursively:
    npm i -g recursive-install  
    npm-recursive-install

    3.) Clean up unnecessary files/folders in git repo:
    find . -empty -type f -print -delete #Remove empty files
    -------------------------------------------------------
    find . -empty -type d -print -delete #Remove empty folders
    -------------------------------------------------------
    This will remove .git folders...    .gitmodule files as well as .gitattributes and .gitignore files.
    find . ParseError: KaTeX parse error: Expected 'EOF', got '&' at position 7: -name &̲quot;.git"… -exec rm -rf -- {} +
    -------------------------------------------------------
    This will remove the filenames you see listed below that just take up space if a repo has been downloaded for use exclusively in your personal file system (in which case the following files just take up space)# Disclaimer... you should not use this command in a repo that you intend to use with your work as it removes files that attribute the work to their original creators!
    find . ParseError: KaTeX parse error: Expected 'EOF', got '&' at position 7: -name &̲quot;*SECURITY.… -exec rm -rf -- {} +
    In Action:
    The following output from my bash shell corresponds to the directory:
    bgoonz/bash-commands-walkthrough
     Deployment github-pages Navigation Big O notation is the language we use for talking about how long an algorithm takes…github.com
    which was created by running the aforementioned commands in in a perfect copy of this directory:
    bgoonz/DS-ALGO-OFFICIAL
     Deployment github-pages Navigation Big O notation is the language we use for talking about how long an algorithm takes…github.com

    …..below is the terminal output for the following commands:

    pwd
    /mnt/c/Users/bryan/Downloads/bash-commands/steps/3-clean-up-fluf/DS-ALGO-OFFICIAL-master

> **After printing the working directory for good measure:**

    find . -empty -type f -print -delete

> **The above command deletes empty files recursively starting from the directory in which it was run:**

    ./CONTENT/DS-n-Algos/File-System/file-utilities/node_modules/line-reader/test/data/empty_file.txt
    ./CONTENT/DS-n-Algos/_Extra-Practice/free-code-camp/nodejs/http-collect.js

> **The command seen below deletes empty folders recursively starting from the directory in which it was run:**

    find . -empty -type d -print -delete

> The resulting directories….

    |01:33:16|bryan@LAPTOP-9LGJ3JGS:[DS-ALGO-OFFICIAL-master] DS-ALGO-OFFICIAL-master_exitstatus:0[╗___________o>

    ./.git/refs/tags

    |01:33:31|bryan@LAPTOP-9LGJ3JGS:[DS-ALGO-OFFICIAL-master] DS-ALGO-OFFICIAL-master_exitstatus:0[╗___________o>

    The command seen below deletes .git folders as well as .gitignore, .gitattributes, .gitmodule files

    find . \( -name ".git" -o -name ".gitignore" -o -name ".gitmodules" -o -name ".gitattributes" \) -exec rm -rf -- {} +

**The command seen below deletes most SECURITY, RELEASE, CHANGELOG, LICENSE, CONTRIBUTING, & HISTORY files that take up pointless space in repo’s you wish to keep exclusively for your own reference.**

### !!!Use with caution as this command removes the attribution of the work from it’s original authors!!!!!

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*r5dGhtbeZ4VdO54U" alt="!!!Use with caution as this command removes the attribution of the work from it’s original authors!!!!!" class="graf-image" /><figcaption>!!!Use with caution as this command removes the attribution of the work from it’s original authors!!!!!</figcaption></figure>find .

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 4.) Generate index.html file that links to all other files in working directory:

    #!/bin/sh
    # find ./ | grep -i "\.*$" >files
    find ./ | sed -E -e 's/([^ ]+[ ]+){8}//' | grep -i "\.*$">files
    listing="files"
    out=""
    html="index.html"
    out="basename $out.html"
    html="index.html"
    cmd() {
      echo '  <!DOCTYPE html>'
      echo '<html>'
      echo '<head>'
      echo '  <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html">'
      echo '  <meta name="Author" content="Bryan Guner">'

    }
    cmd $listing --sort=extension >>$html

#### In Action:

**I will use this copy of my Data Structures Practice Site to demonstrate the result:**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 6.)Recursively remove lines of text containing the string badFolder from files in the working directory.

    find . -type f -exec sed -i '/badFolder/d' ./* {} \;
    OR
    find . -name 'result.md'  -type f -exec sed -i '/badFolder/d' ./* {} ;
    As an example I will run this command on a file containing the text:
    Hacks Blog
    Read more at hacks.mozilla.org
    badFolder
    badFolder Implementing Private Fields for JavaScript
    When implementing a language feature for JavaScript, an implementer must make decisions about how the language in the specification maps to the implementation. Private fields is an example of where the specification language and implementation reality diverge, at least in SpiderMonkey– the JavaScript engine which powers Firefox. To understand more, I’ll explain what private fields are, a couple of models for thinking about them, and explain why our implementation diverges from the specification language.The post Implementing Private Fields for JavaScript appeared first on Mozilla Hacks - the Web developer blog.

    Looking fine with Firefox 89
    Firefox 89 has smartened up and brings with it a slimmed-down, slightly more minimalist interface.badFolder Along with this new look, we get some great styling features including a force-colours feature for media queries and better control over how fonts are displayed. The long-awaited top-level await keyword for JavaScript modules is now enabled, as well as the PerformanceEventTiming interface, which is another addition to the performance suite of APIs: 89 really has been working out!The post Looking fine with Firefox 89 appeared first on Mozilla Hacks - the Web developer blog.

    7.) Execute command recursively:
    Here I have modified the command I wish to run recursively to account for the fact that the ‘find’ command already works recursively, by appending the -maxdepth 1 flag…

    I am essentially removing the recursive action of the find command…

    That way, if the command affects the more deeply nested folders we know the outer RecurseDirs function we are using to run the find/pandoc line once in every subfolder of the working directory… is working properly!



    Run in the folder shown to the left… we would expect every .md file to be accompanied by a newly generated html file by the same name.
    The results of said operation can be found in the following directory
    In Action:
    🢃 Below 🢃



    The final result is:



    If you want to run any bash script recursively all you have to do is substitue out line #9 with the command you want to run once in every sub-folder.
    function RecurseDirs ()
    {
        oldIFS=$IFS
        IFS=$'\n'
        for f in "$@"
        do
    #Replace the line below with your own command!
    #find ./ -iname "*.md" -maxdepth 1 -type f -exec sh -c 'pandoc --standalone "ParseError: KaTeX parse error: Expected 'EOF', got '&' at position 4: {0}&̲quot; -o "{0%.md}.html"' {} ;
    #####################################################
    YOUR CODE BELOW!
    #####################################################
    if -d "${f}"; then

    cd "ParseError: KaTeX parse error: Expected 'EOF', got '&' at position 4: {f}&̲quot;
             …(ls -1 ".")

    cd ..

    fi

    done

    IFS=$oldIFS

    }

    RecurseDirs "./"

    TBC….
    Here are some of the other commands I will cover in greater detail… at a later time:
    9. Copy any text between <script> tags in a file called example.html to be inserted into a new file: out.js
    sed -n -e '/<script>/,/<\/script>/p' example.html >out.js

    if (test "ParseError: KaTeX parse error: Expected 'EOF', got '&' at position 9: filename&̲quot; != "filename_clean")
    then
    mv -v "ParseError: KaTeX parse error: Expected 'EOF', got '&' at position 2: 1&̲quot; "directory/$filename_clean"
    fi
    }
    export -f sanitize
    sanitize_dir() {
    find "ParseError: KaTeX parse error: Expected 'EOF', got '&' at position 2: 1&̲quot; -depth -e…0"' {} ;
    }
    sanitize_dir '/path/to/somewhere'

    12. Start postgresql in terminal
    sudo -u postgres psql

      </body></html>" | tee -a *.html

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 14. Batch Download Videos

    #!/bin/bash
    link="#insert url here#"
    #links were a set of strings with just the index of the video as the variable
    num=3
    #first video was numbered 3 - weird.
    ext=".mp4"
    while [ num−le66]dowgetnum -le 66 ]

### Bash Proficiency In Under 15 Minutes

#### Cheat sheet and in-depth explanations located below main article contents… The UNIX shell program interprets user commands, which are either directly entered by the user, or which can be read from a file called the shell script or shell program. Shell scripts are interpreted, not compiled. The shell reads commands from the script line per line and searches for those commands on the system while a compiler converts a program into machine readable form, an executable file.

#### Change bash’s current working directory

    cd <file path here>
    # to go up a directory from your current directory
    cd ..

#### List a directory’s contents

    ls
    # for more details, add -l (long)
    ls -l
    # this will output something like this:
    # -rw-r--r--  1 cameronnokes  staff  1237 Jun  2 22:46 index.js
    # in order, those columns are:
    #   permissions for you, your group, all
    #   number of links (hardlinks & softlinks)
    #   owner user
    #   owner group
    #   file size
    #   last modified time
    #   file name
    to see hidden files/folders (like .git or .npmignore)
    ls -a
    Note, flags can be combined like so
    ls -la
    View files and folders in bash
    Output a file to the screen (stdout)
    cat <file name>
    # shows it with line numbers
    cat -n <file name>

#### View a file in bash

    # view the file without dumping it all onto your screen
    less <file name>
    # Some useful shortcuts in less
    #   Shift+g   (jump to end)
    #   g         (go back to top)
    #   /         (search)
    #   q         (quit/close)

#### View file/folder in default application associated with it

    open <file/folder name>
    # view current directory in Finder
    open .
    # specify an application to use
    open <file name> -a TextEdit

### Explanations:

### Pipes

Pipes let you use the output of a program as the input of another one

### simple pipe with sed

This is very simple way to use pipes.

    ls -l | sed -e "s/[aeio]/u/g"

Here, the following happens: first the command ls -l is executed, and it’s output, instead of being printed, is sent (piped) to the sed program, which in turn, prints what it has to.

### an alternative to ls -l \*.txt

Probably, this is a more difficult way to do ls -l \*.txt, but this is for educational purposes.

    ls -l | grep "\.txt$"

> Here, the output of the program ls -l is sent to the grep program, which, in turn, will print lines which match the regex “\\.txt$”.

### Variables

You can use variables as in any programming languages. There are no data types. A variable in bash can contain a number, a character, a string of characters.

You have no need to declare a variable, just assigning a value to its reference will create it.

### Hello World! using variables

    #!/bin/bash          
                STR="Hello World!"
                echo $STR

Line 2 creates a variable called STR and assigns the string “Hello World!” to it. Then the VALUE of this variable is retrieved by putting the ‘<span class="math inline">’*inatthebeginning*.*Pleasenotice*(*tryit*!)*thatifyoudon*’*tusethe*‘</span>’ sign, the output of the program will be different, and probably not what you want it to be.

### A very simple backup script (little bit better)

    #!/bin/bash          
               OF=/var/my-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).tgz
               tar -cZf $OF /home/me/

> This script introduces another thing. First of all, you should be familiarized with the variable creation and assignation on line 2. Notice the expression ‘$(date +%Y%m%d)’. If you run the script you’ll notice that it runs the command inside the parenthesis, capturing its output.

> Notice that in this script, the output filename will be different every day, due to the format switch to the date command(+%Y%m%d). You can change this by specifying a different format.

**examples**:

*echo ls*

*echo $(ls)*

### Local variables

Local variables can be created by using the keyword *local*.

    #!/bin/bash
                    HELLO=Hello 
                    function hello {
                            local HELLO=World
                            echo $HELLO
                    }
                    echo $HELLO
                    hello
                    echo $HELLO

### Basic conditional example if .. then

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*V2XDOXCJO2I8qYBK.jpg" class="graf-image" /></figure>\#!/bin/bash if \[ “foo” = “foo” \]; then echo expression evaluated as true fi

*The code to be executed if the expression within braces is true can be found after the ‘then’ word and before ‘fi’ which indicates the end of the conditionally executed code.*

### Basic conditional example if .. then … else

    #!/bin/bash
                if [ "foo" = "foo" ]; then
                   echo expression evaluated as true
                else
                   echo expression evaluated as false
                fi

### Conditionals with variables

    #!/bin/bash
                T1="foo"
                T2="bar"
                if [ "$T1" = "$T2" ]; then
                    echo expression evaluated as true
                else
                    echo expression evaluated as false
                fi

### Loops

-   <span id="15f6">***for***</span>
-   <span id="4000">***while***</span>

> (there’s another loop called until but I don’t use it so you can look it up if you’d like)

> ***The until loop is almost equal to the while loop, except that the code is executed while the*** <a href="https://www.cs.fsu.edu/~myers/c++/notes/control1.html" class="markup--anchor markup--blockquote-anchor"><strong><em>control expression</em></strong></a> ***evaluates to false.***

The **for** loop is a little bit different from other programming languages. Basically, it let’s you iterate over a series of ‘words’ within a string.

The **while** executes a piece of code if the control expression is true, and only stops when it is false …or a explicit break is found within the executed code.

### For

    #!/bin/bash
            for i in $( ls ); do
                echo item: $i
            done

> On the second line, we declare i to be the variable that will take the different values contained in $( ls ).

> The third line could be longer if needed, or there could be more lines before the done (4).

> ‘done’ (4) indicates that the code that used the value of $i has finished and $i can take a new value.

> A more useful way to use the for loop would be to use it to match only certain files on the previous example

### While

    #!/bin/bash 
             COUNTER=0
             while [  $COUNTER -lt 10 ]; do
                 echo The counter is $COUNTER
                 let COUNTER=COUNTER+1 
             done

### Functions

As in almost any programming language, you can use functions to group pieces of code in a more logical way or practice the divine art of recursion.

Declaring a function is just a matter of writing function my\_func { my\_code }.

Calling a function is just like calling another program, you just write its name.

### Functions ex.)

    #!/bin/bash 
               function quit {
                   exit
               }
               function hello {
                   echo Hello!
               }
               hello
               quit
               echo foo

> Lines 2–4 contain the ‘quit’ function. Lines 5–7 contain the ‘hello’ function If you are not absolutely sure about what this script does, please try it!.

> Notice that a functions don’t need to be declared in any specific order.

> When running the script you’ll notice that first: the function ‘hello’ is called, second the ‘quit’ function, and the program never reaches line 10.

### Functions with parameters

    #!/bin/bash 
                    function quit {
                       exit
                    }  
                    function e {
                        echo $1 
                    }  
                    e Hello
                    e World
                    quit
                    echo foo

### Backup Directory Script:

    #!/bin/bash          
                SRCD="/home/"
                TGTD="/var/backups/"
                OF=home-$(date +%Y%m%d).tgz
                tar -cZf $TGTD$OF $SRCD

    python hello.py > output.txt   # stdout to (file)
    python hello.py >> output.txt  # stdout to (file), append
    python hello.py 2> error.log   # stderr to (file)
    python hello.py 2>&1           # stderr to stdout
    python hello.py 2>/dev/null    # stderr to (null)
    python hello.py &>/dev/null    # stdout and stderr to (null)
    python hello.py < foo.txt      # feed foo.txt to stdin for python
    Inspecting commands
    command -V cd
    #=> "cd is a function/alias/whatever"

### Trap errors

    trap 'echo Error at about $LINENO' ERR

or

    traperr() {
      echo "ERROR: ${BASH_SOURCE[1]} at about ${BASH_LINENO[0]}"
    }
    set -o errtrace

    trap traperr ERR
    Case/switch
    case "$1" in
      start | up)
        vagrant up
        ;;
    *)

    echo "Usage: $0 {start|stop|ssh}"

    ;;

    esac
    Source relative
    source "${0%/*}/../share/foo.sh"

### printf

    printf "Hello %s, I'm %s" Sven Olga
    #=> "Hello Sven, I'm Olga
    printf "1 + 1 = %d" 2
    #=> "1 + 1 = 2"
    printf "This is how you print a float: %f" 2

    #=> "This is how you print a float: 2.000000"
    Directory of script
    DIR="${0%/*}"

### Getting options

    while [[ "$1" =~ ^- && ! "$1" == "--" ]]; do case $1 in
      -V | --version )
        echo $version
        exit
        ;;

#### Using `()` implicitly returns components.Role of `index.js` is to *render* your application.The reference to `root` comes from a div in the body of your public html file.State of a component is simply a regular JS Object.Class Components require `render()` method to return JSX.Functional Components directly return JSX.`Class` is `className` in React.When parsing for an integer just chain `Number.parseInt("123")`

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*16IltJu5wXjzgXyU.gif" class="graf-image" /></figure>-   <span id="3b86">**Use ternary operator if you want to make a conditional inside a fragment.**</span>

<!-- -->

    { x === y ? <div>Naisu</div> : <div>Not Naisu</div>; }

    Purpose of React.Fragment is to allow you to create groups of children without adding an extra dom element.

-   <span id="5cbe">**React** manages the creation and updating of DOM nodes in your Web page.</span>
-   <span id="d253">All it does is dynamically render stuff into your DOM.</span>
-   <span id="093c">What it doesn’t do:</span>
-   <span id="bd7d">Ajax</span>
-   <span id="7f06">Services</span>
-   <span id="b1b9">Local Storage</span>
-   <span id="47a9">Provide a CSS framework</span>
-   <span id="57d1">**React** is unopinionated</span>
-   <span id="b277">Just contains a few rules for developers to follow, and it just works.</span>
-   <span id="dafd">**JSX** : Javascript Extension is a language invented to help write React Applications (looks like a mixture of JS and HTML)</span>
-   <span id="fc46">Here is an overview of the difference between rendering out vanilla JS to create elements, and JSX:</span>

<!-- -->

-   <span id="eec2">This may seem like a lot of code but when you end up building many components, it becomes nice to put each of those functions/classes into their own files to organize your code.

-   <span id="6c32">`React DevTools` : New tool in your browser to see ow React is working in the browser</span>
-   <span id="3f86">`create-react-app` : Extensible command-line tool to help generate standard React applications.</span>
-   <span id="da3c">`Webpack` : In between tool for dealing with the extra build step involved.</span>

-   <span id="1589">Basically, React is super important to learn and master.</span>

### React Concepts and Features

There are many benefits to using React over just Vanilla JS.

-   <span id="6bac">`Modularity`</span>
-   <span id="3fc9">To avoid the mess of many event listeners and template strings, React gives you the benefit of a lot of modularity.</span>
-   <span id="20d5">`Easy to start`</span>
-   <span id="8e3e">No specials tools are needed to use Basic React.</span>
-   <span id="f1a2">You can start working directly with `createElement` method in React.</span>
-   <span id="2a43">`Declarative Programming`</span>
-   <span id="c587">React is declarative in nature, utilizing either it’s build in createElement method or the higher-level language known as JSX.</span>
-   <span id="866d">`Reusability`</span>
-   <span id="eff3">Create elements that can be re-used over and over.  
    **One-flow of data**</span>
-   <span id="5c6e">React apps are built as a combination of parent and child components.</span>
-   <span id="5a30">Parents can have one or more child components, all children have parents.</span>
-   <span id="d6c8">Data is never passed from child to the parent.</span>
-   <span id="dc54">`Virtual DOM` : React provides a Virtual DOM that acts as an agent between the real DOM and the developer to help debug, maintain, and provide general use.</span>
-   <span id="90bf">Due to this usage, React handles web pages much more intelligently; making it one of the speediest Front End Libraries available.</span>

Basic Web Development Environment Setup
=======================================

Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) and Ubuntu

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Basic Web Development Environment Setup

#### Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) and Ubuntu

‌

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*aqKP1drNHmNm34zz.jpg" class="graf-image" /></figure>Test if you have Ubuntu installed by typing “Ubuntu” in the search box in the bottom app bar that reads “Type here to search”. If you see a search result that reads **“Ubuntu 20.04 LTS”** with “App” under it, then you have it installed.

‌

1.  <span id="110a">In the application search box in the bottom bar, type “PowerShell” to find the application named “Windows PowerShell”</span>
2.  <span id="54fd">Right-click on “Windows PowerShell” and choose “Run as administrator” from the popup menu</span>
3.  <span id="a018">In the blue PowerShell window, type the following: `Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online             -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux`</span>
4.  <span id="6269">Restart your computer</span>
5.  <span id="6dd9">In the application search box in the bottom bar, type “Store” to find the application named “Microsoft Store”</span>
6.  <span id="eb4e">Click “Microsoft Store”</span>
7.  <span id="74c1">Click the “Search” button in the upper-right corner of the window</span>
8.  <span id="9d35">Type in “Ubuntu”</span>
9.  <span id="4205">Click “Run Linux on Windows (Get the apps)”</span>
10. <span id="1799">Click the orange tile labeled **“Ubuntu”** Note that there are 3 versions in the Microsoft Store… you want the one just entitled ‘Ubuntu’</span>
11. <span id="edec">Click “Install”</span>
12. <span id="2935">After it downloads, click “Launch”</span>
13. <span id="a859">If you get the option, pin the application to the task bar. Otherwise, right-click on the orange Ubuntu icon in the task bar and choose “Pin to taskbar”</span>
14. <span id="669c">When prompted to “Enter new UNIX username”, type your first name with no spaces</span>
15. <span id="e9c1">When prompted, enter and retype a password for this UNIX user (it can be the same as your Windows password)</span>
16. <span id="4217">Confirm your installation by typing the command `whoami ‘as in             who-am-i'`followed by Enter at the prompt (it should print your first name)</span>
17. <span id="48fe">You need to update your packages, so type `sudo apt update` (if prompted for your password, enter it)</span>
18. <span id="d12f">You need to upgrade your packages, so type `sudo apt upgrade` (if prompted for your password, enter it)</span>

### Git

Git comes with Ubuntu, so there’s nothing to install. However, you should configure it using the following instructions.

‌Open an Ubuntu terminal if you don’t have one open already.

1.  <span id="8cfe">You need to configure Git, so type `git config --global user.name "Your             Name"` with replacing “Your Name” with your real name.</span>
2.  <span id="0e0d">You need to configure Git, so type `git config --global user.email your@email.com` with replacing “<a href="mailto:your@email.com" class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor">your@email.com</a>” with your real email.</span>

**Note: if you want git to remember your login credentials type:**

    $ git config --global credential.helper store

‌

### Google Chrome

Test if you have Chrome installed by typing “Chrome” in the search box in the bottom app bar that reads “Type here to search”. If you see a search result that reads “Chrome” with “App” under it, then you have it installed. Otherwise, follow these instructions to install Google Chrome.

‌

1.  <span id="578c">Open Microsoft Edge, the blue “e” in the task bar, and type in <a href="http://chrome.google.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor">http://chrome.google.com</a>. Click the “Download Chrome” button. Click the “Accept and Install” button after reading the terms of service. Click “Save” in the “What do you want to do with ChromeSetup.exe” dialog at the bottom of the window. When you have the option to “Run” it, do so. Answer the questions as you’d like. Set it as the default browser.</span>
2.  <span id="40db">Right-click on the Chrome icon in the task bar and choose “Pin to taskbar”.</span>

### Node.js

Test if you have Node.js installed by opening an Ubuntu terminal and typing `node --version`. If it reports “Command ‘node’ not found”, then you need to follow these directions.

1.  <span id="9098">In the Ubuntu terminal, type `sudo apt update` and press Enter</span>
2.  <span id="806b">In the Ubuntu terminal, type `sudo apt install build-essential` and press Enter</span>
3.  <span id="5f3a">In the Ubuntu terminal, type `curl -o-             https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.35.2/install.sh | bash` and press Enter</span>
4.  <span id="2abd">In the Ubuntu terminal, type `. ./.bashrc` and press Enter</span>
5.  <span id="3c16">In the Ubuntu terminal, type `nvm install --lts` and press Enter</span>
6.  <span id="d567">Confirm that **node** is installed by typing `node --version` and seeing it print something that is not “Command not found”!</span>

### Unzip

You will often have to download a zip file and unzip it. It is easier to do this from the command line. So we need to install a linux unzip utility.

‌In the Ubuntu terminal type: `sudo apt install unzip` and press Enter

‌Mocha.js

Test if you have Mocha.js installed by opening an Ubuntu terminal and typing `which mocha`. If it prints a path, then you’re good. Otherwise, if it prints nothing, install Mocha.js by typing `npm         install -g mocha`.

‌

### Python 3

Ubuntu does not come with Python 3. Install it using the command `sudo apt install python3`. Test it by typing `python3 --version` and seeing it print a number.

‌

### Note about WSL

‌

As of the time of writing of this document, WSL has an issue renaming or deleting files if Visual Studio Code is open. So before doing any linux commands which manipulate files, make sure you **close** Visual Studio Code before running those commands in the Ubuntu terminal.

‌

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<span class="graf-dropCap">H</span>ere I will walk through a demo…. skip down below for more fundamental examples and resources…

### React Demo

-   <span id="91c8">ex1 — A Basic React Component</span>
-   <span id="78f6">ex2 — A Basic React Class Component</span>
-   <span id="1e73">ex3 — A Class Component with State</span>
-   <span id="ba57">ex4 — A Class Component that Updates State</span>
-   <span id="203a">ex5 — A Class Component that Iterates through State</span>
-   <span id="8087">ex6 — An Example of Parent and Child Components</span>

With regards to converting an existing HTML, CSS, and JS site into React, first you’ll want to think about how to break up your site into components,

-   <span id="694c">as well as think about what the general hierarchical component structure of your site will look like.</span>
-   <span id="fdf0">From there, it’s a simple matter of copying the relevant HTML for that component and throwing it into the **render method of your component file.**</span>
-   <span id="ec78">*Any methods that are needed for that component to function properly can added onto your new component.*</span>

Once you’ve refactored your HTML components into React components, you’ll want to lay them out in the desired hierarchical structure

-   <span id="227c">with children components being rendered by their parents, as well as ensuring that the parent components are passing down the necessary data as props to their children components.</span>

ex.)

    <!-- Hello world -->
    <div class="awesome" style="border: 1px solid red">
      <label for="name">Enter your name: </label>
      <input type="text" id="name" />
    </div>
    <p>Enter your HTML here</p>

Is equivalent to:

### A Basic Component

<span class="graf-dropCap">A</span> component is some thing that is being rendered in the browser. It could be a button, a form with a bunch of fields in it…etc.…

React doesn’t place any restrictions on how large or small a component can be.

You *could* have an entire static site encapsulated in a single React component, but that would defeat the purpose of using React.

So the first thing to remember about a component is that a **component must *render* something.**

*If nothing is being rendered from a component, then React will throw an error.*

Inside of `BasicComponent.js` , first import React at the top of the file. Our most basic of components looks like this:

> *This is a component that simply returns a div tag with the words Hello World! inside.*

> *The last line simply exports our component so that it can be imported  
> by another file.*

Notice that this component looks exactly like an anonymous arrow function that we’ve named `BasicComponent` .

In fact, that is literally what this is.

The arrow function then is simply returning the div tag. When a component is written as a function like this one is, it is called a *functional* component.

### A Basic Class Component

The above component is an example of a functional component, which is appropriate since that component is literally nothing more than a function that returns some HTML.

*Functional components are great when all you want a component to do is to render some stuff.*

*Components can also be written as classes (although this paradigm is becoming outdated and you should strive to write your components functionally!*

For this exercise, we’re going to write a class component that does exactly the same thing as the functional component we just wrote.

We’ll again need to import React at the top of the file, but we’ll also need to add a little something. Our import statement will look like this:

    import React, { Component } from 'react';

**So, in addition to importing React, we’re also importing the base Component class that is included in the React library.**

#### React lets you define components as classes or functions.

Components defined as classes currently provide more features . To define a React component class, you need to extend `React.Component`:

    class Welcome extends React.Component {
      render() {
        return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;
      }
    }

**The only method you *must* define in a** `React.Component` **subclass is called** `render()`**.**

### `render()`

The `render()` method is the only required method in a class component.

When called, it should examine `this.props` and `this.state` and return one of the following types:

-   <span id="8e4e">**React elements.** Typically created via <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html" class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor">JSX</a>. For example, `<div />` and `<MyComponent />` are React elements that instruct React to render a DOM node, or another user-defined component, respectively.</span>
-   <span id="2c5f">**Arrays and fragments.** Let you return multiple elements from render. See the documentation on <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/fragments.html" class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor">fragments</a> for more details.</span>
-   <span id="2e6f">**Portals**. Let you render children into a different DOM subtree. See the documentation on <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/portals.html" class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor">portals</a> for more details.</span>
-   <span id="83d1">**String and numbers.** These are rendered as text nodes in the DOM.</span>
-   <span id="5c6a">**Booleans or** `null`. Render nothing. (Mostly exists to support `return test && <Child />` pattern, where `test` is boolean.)</span>

The `render()` function should be pure, meaning that it does not modify component state, it returns the same result each time it’s invoked, and it does not directly interact with the browser.

If you need to interact with the browser, perform your work in `componentDidMount()` or the other lifecycle methods instead. Keeping `render()` pure makes components easier to think about.

> *Note*

> `render()` *will not be invoked if* `shouldComponentUpdate()` *returns false.*

The export statement at the bottom of the file also stays, completely unchanged. Our class component will thus look like this:

**Notice that our** `BasicClassComponent` **inherits from the base** `Component` **class that we imported from the React library, by virtue of the ‘extends’ keyword.**

*That being said, there’s nothing in this minimal component that takes advantage of any of those inherited methods.*

**All we have is a method on our component class called** `render` **that returns the same div tag.**

If we really were deciding between whether to use a functional component versus a class component to render a simple div tag, then the functional style is more appropriate to use.

This is because class components are much better suited for handling component state and triggering events based on the component’s <a href="https://projects.wojtekmaj.pl/react-lifecycle-methods-diagram/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">lifecycle.</a>

#### The important takeaways at this point are that there are two types of components, functional and class components, and that functional components are well-suited if you’re just looking to render some HTML.

*Class components, on the other hand, are much better suited for handling components that require more complex functionality, need to exhibit more varied behavior, and/or need to keep track of some state that may change throughout said component’s lifecycle.*

### A Class Component with Some State

**Component state is any dynamic data that we want the component to keep track of.**

> For example, let’s say we have a form component. This form has some input fields that we’d like users to fill out. When a user types characters into an input field, how is that input persisted from the point of view of our form component?

**The answer is by using component state!**

There are a few important concepts regarding component state, such as how to update it, pass it to another component, render it, etc.

**Only class components have the ability to persist state, so if at any time you realize that a component needs to keep track of some state, you know that you’ll automatically need a class component instead of a functional component.**

> It is possible to handle state with functional components but that requires the use of something called the <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html" class="markup--anchor markup--blockquote-anchor">useState() hook</a>. Hooks were added in React 16.8; prior to this release, there was no mechanism to add state to functional components.

Here’s what the above component looks like as a functional component:

Our class component with state will look a lot like the basic class component we just wrote, but with some exceptions:

**So far, the only new thing going on here is the constructor block. If you recall how classes in JavaScript work, classes need constructors.**

**Additionally, if a class is extending off of another class and wants access to its parent class’s methods and properties, then the** `super` **function needs to be called inside the class’s constructor function.**

#### Point being, the constructor function and the call to the `super` function are *not* associated with React, they are associated with all JavaScript classes.

-   <span id="0d56">Then there is the `this.state` **property inside the constructor function that is set as an empty object**.</span>
-   <span id="7b29">We’re adding a property called `state` to our class and setting it to an empty object.</span>

#### State objects in React are always just plain old objects.

#### **So why is it that the basic class component we wrote in the previous exercise had no constructor function within its body?**

That is because we had no need for them since all our class component was doing was rendering some HTML.

**The constructor is needed here because that is where we need to initialize our state object.**

**The call to** `super` **is needed because we can’t reference** `this` **inside of our constructor without a call to** `super` **first.**

Ok, now let’s actually use this state object.

*One very common application of state objects in React components is to render the data being stored inside them within our component’s render function.*

#### Refactoring our component class to do that:

We added a key-value pair to our state object inside our constructor.

-   <span id="83e8">Then we changed the contents of the render function.</span>
-   <span id="6780">Now, it’s actually rendering the data that we have inside the state object.</span>
-   <span id="eb34">Notice that inside the div tags we’re using a template string literal so that we can access the value of `this.state.someData` straight inside of our rendered content.</span>

**With Reacts newest version, we can actually now add state to a component without explicitly defining a constructor on the class. We can refactor our class component to look like this:**

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*6sYhFUNpUkt6xN9kkn4pJQ.png" class="graf-image" /></figure>This new syntax is what is often referred to as ‘syntactic sugar’: under the hood, the React library translates this back into the old constructor code that we first started with, so that the JavaScript remains valid to the JavaScript interpreter.

The clue to this is the fact that when we want to access some data from the state object, we still need to call it with `this.state.someData` ; changing it to just `state.someData` does not work.

### Class Component Updating State

Great, so we can render some state that our component persists for us.

However, we said an important use case of component state is to handle *dynamic* data.

A single static number isn’t very dynamic at all.

So now let’s walk through how to update component state.

Notice that we’ve added two methods to our class: `increment` and `decrement` .

`increment` and `decrement` are methods that *we* are adding to our class component.

Unlike the `render` method, `increment` and `decrement` were not already a part of our class component.

This is why `increment` and `decrement` are written as arrow functions, ***so that they are automatically bound to our class component.***

The alternative is using a declaration syntax function with the bind method to bind the context of our methods to the class component.

The more interesting thing is what is going on within the bodies of these methods.

#### Each calls the `setState` function.

-   <span id="df3c">`setState` in fact *is* provided to us by React.</span>

It is the standard way to update a component’s state.

It’s the *only* way you should ever update a component’s state. It may seem more verbose than necessary, but there are good reasons for why you should be doing it this way.

#### So the way to use `setState` to update a component’s state is to pass it an object with each of the state keys you wish to update, along with the updated value.

In our `increment` method we said “I would like to update the `aNumber` property on my component state by adding one to it and then setting the new value as my new `aNumber`”.

The same thing happens in our `decrement` method, only we’re subtracting instead of adding.

Then the other new concept we’re running into here is how to actually call these methods we’ve added to our class.

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*k8t5QBcMvHDX521sd4pC4g.png" class="graf-image" /></figure>We added two HTML button tags within our `render` function, then in their respective `onClick` handlers, we specify the method that should be called whenever this button gets clicked. So whenever we click either of the buttons, our state gets updated appropriately and our component will re-render to show the correct value we’re expecting.

### Class Component Iterating State

Another common state pattern you’ll see being used in React components is iterating over an array in our state object and rendering each array element in its own tag.

> This is often used in order to render lists.

Additionally, we want to be able to easily update lists and have React re-render our updated list.

We’ll see how both of these are done and how they work together within a single component in order to create the behavior of a dynamic list.

The first change to note is that our state object now has an ‘ingredients’ array, and a ‘newIngredient’ field that has been initialized to an empty string.

The ingredients array contains the elements that we’ll want to render in our list.

The `addIngredient` and `handleIngredientInput` methods we’ve added to our class receives a parameter called ‘event’.

This event object is part of the browser’s API.

When we interact with some DOM element, **such as clicking on an HTML button, the *function that is invoked upon that button being clicked* actually receives the event object.**

-   <span id="3ba1">So when we type some input into an input tag, we’re able grab each character that was typed into the input field through the event object parameter.</span>
-   <span id="5de7">The `handleIngredientInput` method is what gets invoked every time the user presses a key to enter text in the input box for adding a new ingredient.</span>
-   <span id="514e">Every character the user types gets persisted in the `newIngredient` field on the state object.</span>

We’re able to grab the text in the input box using `event.target.value`

**Which holds the value of the string text that is currently in the input box**.

> We use that to update our `newIngredient` string field.

Breaking down the `addIngredient` method, we see this `event.preventDefault()` invocation.

This is because this method will be used upon submitting a form, and it turns out that submitting a form triggers some default form behavior that we don’t want to trigger when we submit the form (**namely refreshing the entire page**).

> `event.preventDefault()` will prevent this default form behavior, meaning our form will only do what we want it to do when it is submitted.

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*RN_y7Bk4tb-LLG8vNqGHHA.png" class="graf-image" /></figure>Next, we store a reference to `this.state.ingredients` in a variable called `ingredientsList` .

So we now have a copy of the array that is stored in our state object.

**We want to update the copy of the ingredients array first instead of directly updating the actual array itself in state.**

Now we push whatever value is being stored at our `newIngredient` field onto the `ingredientsList` array so that our `ingredientsList` array is now more up-to-date than our `this.state.ingredients` array.

So all we have to do now is call `setState` appropriately in order to update the value in our state object.

Additionally, we also set the `newIngredient` field back to an empty string in order to clear out the input field once we submit a new ingredient.

Now it’s ready to accept more user input!

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*LXx7WeP_5wFRfYa45snSEA.png" class="graf-image" /></figure>Looking at our render function, first note the `this.state.ingredients.map` call.

This is looping through each ingredient in our `ingredients` array and returning each one within its own div tag.

This is a very common pattern for rendering everything inside an array.

Then we have an HTML form which contains an input field.

The purpose of this form is to allow a user to add new ingredients to the list. Note that we’re passing our `addIngredient` method to the form’s `onSubmit` handler.

This means that our `addIngredient` method gets invoked whenever our form is submitted.

Lastly, the input field has an `onChange` handler that invokes our `handleIngredientInput` method whenever there is some sort of change in the input field, namely when a user types into it.

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*S7s9FfaPVlKGyaSwFeId_w.png" class="graf-image" /></figure>Notice that the `value` field in our input tag reads off of `this.state.newIngredient` in order to know what value to display.

So when a user enters text into the input field, the `onChange` handler is invoked every time, which updates our `this.state.newIngredient` field, which the input field and then renders.

### Parent and Child Components

A single isolated component isn’t going to do us much good.

> The beauty of React lies in the fact that it allows us to compose modular components together.

> Let’s start off with the component we just saw, but let’s change its name to `ParentComponent` .

The only two other differences in this component are that we’re importing a `ChildComponent` and then using it inside our `this.state.ingredients.map` call.

`ChildComponent` is another React component.

Notice that we’re using it just as if it were any other HTML tag.

**This is how we lay out our component hierarchy: the ChildComponent is rendered within the ParentComponent.**

We can see this to be the case if we open up the developer console and inspect these elements.

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*q_XLnJ2h1L5yZjNnSKzj5w.png" alt="child-left: parent-right" class="graf-image" /><figcaption><strong>child-left: parent-right</strong></figcaption></figure>Note also that we’re passing each ingredient as a ‘thing’ to the ChildComponent component.

This is how a parent component passes data to a child component. It doesn’t need to be called ‘thing’; you can call it whatever you want.

Conceptually though, **every piece of data that a parent component passes down to a child component is called a ‘prop’ in React lingo.**

Let’s take a look now at the Child Component. It serves two purposes:

1.  <span id="4db5">to render the props data that it gets from a parent component,</span>
2.  <span id="f8e1">to add the ability for a user to click on it and have it toggle a strikethrough, indicating that the item is ‘complete’.</span>

The overall structure of the child component is nothing we haven’t seen. It’s just another class component with its own s**tate object and a method called** `handleClick`** .**

**A component accesses its props via the** `this.props` **object.**

*Any prop a parent component passes down to a child component is accessible inside the child component’s* `this.prop` *object.*

So our child component keeps its own state that tracks whether the component has been clicked or not.

Then at the top of the `render` function, it uses a ternary condition to determine whether the div tag that is being rendered should have a strikethrough or not.

The `handleClick` method is then invoked via an `onClick` handler on the div tag; it does the work of toggling the `this.state.clicked` Boolean.

The overall structure of React applications can be represented as a hierarchical tree structure, just like how the DOM itself is structure. There is an overarching root component at the top of the hierarchy that every other component sits underneath. Specifying that a component should be a child of some parent component is as simple as throwing it in the parent component’s render function, just like how we did it in this example

#### 1. What is react?

#### React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It uses components to update and render as your data changes.

> React manages the **creation and continuous updating of DOM nodes in your Web page**.

-   <span id="c9b6">*It does not handle* <a href="https://skillcrush.com/blog/what-is-ajax/" class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor"><em>AJAX</em></a> *requests, Local Storage or style your website. IT is just a tool to dynamically render content on a webpage as a result of changes in ‘state’. Because it’s function is so limited in scope you may hear it referred to as a library… (not a framework … like Angular for example) and you may also hear it described as unopinionated.*</span>

#### 2. Why use react?

-   <span id="45da">Works for teams and helps UI workflow patterns</span>
-   <span id="f328">The components can be reusable</span>
-   <span id="ea48">Componentized UI is the future of web dev</span>

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*pFe_v7Ea--vfdmvR3UcunA.png" class="graf-image" /></figure>### Declarative programming

In the same way that you use HTML to *declare* what the user interface should  
look like, React provides the same mechanism in its `createElement` method or the higher-level language known as JSX.

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/0*MW-A5Dp_v1T0BB1s.png" alt="React… like HTML is Declarative" class="graf-image" /><figcaption>React… like HTML is Declarative</figcaption></figure><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">Declarative programming</a> is often defined as any style of programming that is not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" title="Imperative programming">imperative</a>.

A number of other common definitions attempt to define it by simply contrasting it with imperative programming. For example:

-   <span id="97d7">A high-level program that describes what a computation should perform.</span>
-   <span id="0283">Any programming language that lacks <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect_%28computer_science%29" class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor" title="Computation">side effects</a></span>
-   <span id="4173">A language with a clear correspondence to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_logic" class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor">mathematical logic</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming#cite_note-5" class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor">[5]</a></span>

These definitions overlap substantially.

<span class="graf-dropCap">D</span>**eclarative programming is a non-imperative style of programming in which programs describe their desired results without explicitly listing commands or steps that must be performed.**

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" title="Functional programming">Functional</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_programming" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" title="Logical programming">logical programming</a> languages are characterized by a declarative programming style.

*In a* <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_functional_language" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" title="Pure functional language"><em>pure functional language</em></a>*, such as* <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_%28programming_language%29" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor"><em>Haskell</em></a>*, all functions are* <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" title="Pure function"><em>without side effects</em></a>*, and state changes are only represented as functions that transform the state, which is explicitly represented as a* <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_citizen" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" title="Mathematical logic"><em>first-class</em></a> *object in the program.*

### What is a React pure component?

<a href="https://blog.logrocket.com/react-pure-components-functional/#whatisareactpurecomponent" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">Based on the concept of purity in functional programming paradigms, a function is said to be pure if:</a>

-   <span id="12b8">Its return value is only determined by its input values</span>
-   <span id="c2a4">Its return value is always the same for the same input values</span>

A React component is considered pure if it renders the same output for the same state and props. For class components like this, React provides the `PureComponent` base class. Class components that extend the `React.PureComponent` class are treated as pure components.

Pure components have some performance improvements and render optimizations since React implements the `shouldComponentUpdate()` method for them with a shallow comparison for props and state.

### Are React functional components pure?

Functional components are very useful in React, especially when you want to isolate state management from the component. That’s why they are often called stateless components.

However, functional components cannot leverage the performance improvements and render optimizations that come with `React.PureComponent` since they are not classes by definition.

If you want React to treat a functional component as a pure component, you’ll have to convert the functional component to a class component that extends `React.PureComponent`.

### Reusability

React encourages you to think in terms of reusability as you construct the user  
interface from elements and components that you create. When you  
make a list or a button, you can then reuse those components to show different data ‘state’ in the same UI structure as you have built for different data previously.

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*cBLQ5aBP2qihrT59.jpeg" class="graf-image" /></figure>#### Component-Based

Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs.

Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep state out of the DOM.

#### Learn Once, Write Anywhere

We don’t make assumptions about the rest of your technology stack, so you can develop new features in React without rewriting existing code.

React can also render on the server using Node and power mobile apps using <a href="https://reactnative.dev/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">React Native</a>.

### Speed

Due to the use of a virtual DOM, React handles changes to a Web page more  
intelligently than just string manipulation. It is constantly monitors the  
virtual DOM for changes. It very efficiently reconciles changes in the virtual  
DOM with what it has already produced in the real DOM. This is what  
makes React one of the speediest front-end libraries available.

-   <span id="3b52">React library is used for the react syntax.</span>
-   <span id="281c">React DOM is used to update the DOM.</span>
-   <span id="8818">We then have the Class section which creates the component.</span>
-   <span id="aad6">Render() describes the specific UI for the component.</span>
-   <span id="2165">Return is used to return the JSX</span>
-   <span id="7757">And Finally ReactDOM.render is used to update the DOM.</span>

#### 8. Data flow with props

Small examples of data flow, see if you can get the code to work.

#### 9. Creating lists with map

The parent component passes down to the child component as props.

Using props to access names and map to loop through each list item. Then passing this by using props.

Checking data to see if Boolean is true then adding detail to the list.

#### 10. Prop types

PropTypes allow you to declare the type (string, number, function, etc) of each prop being passed to a component. Then if a prop passed in isn’t of the declared type you’ll get a warning in the console.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Excerpt from the React website:

### React — A JavaScript library for building user interfaces

> *A JavaScript library for building user interfaces*

#### Declarative

React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes.

Declarative views make your code more predictable and easier to debug.

#### A Simple Component

React components implement a `render()` method that takes input data and returns what to display. This example uses an XML-like syntax called JSX. Input data that is passed into the component can be accessed by `render()` via `this.props`.

JSX is optional and not required to use React. Try the <a href="https://babeljs.io/repl/#?presets=react&amp;code_lz=MYewdgzgLgBApgGzgWzmWBeGAeAFgRgD4AJRBEAGhgHcQAnBAEwEJsB6AwgbgChRJY_KAEMAlmDh0YWRiGABXVOgB0AczhQAokiVQAQgE8AkowAUAcjogQUcwEpeAJTjDgUACIB5ALLK6aRklTRBQ0KCohMQk6Bx4gA" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">Babel REPL</a> to see the raw JavaScript code produced by the JSX compilation step.

In addition to taking input data (accessed via `this.props`), a component can maintain internal state data (accessed via `this.state`). When a component’s state data changes, the rendered markup will be updated by re-invoking `render()`.

#### An Application

Using `props` and `state`, we can put together a small Todo application. This example uses `state` to track the current list of items as well as the text that the user has entered. Although event handlers appear to be rendered inline, they will be collected and implemented using event delegation.

#### A Component Using External Plugins

React allows you to interface with other libraries and frameworks. This example uses remarkable, an external Markdown library, to convert the `<textarea>`’s value in real time.

### The Repository & Live Site Behind This Article:

### About Python(Taken From Tutorial Page Of Docs):

<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/appetite.html" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">Python enables programs to be written compactly and readably. Programs written in Python are typically much shorter than equivalent C, C++, or Java programs, for several reasons:</a>

-   <span id="894d">the high-level data types allow you to express complex operations in a single statement;</span>
-   <span id="48ef">statement grouping is done by indentation instead of beginning and ending brackets;</span>
-   <span id="f361">no variable or argument declarations are necessary.</span>

### Installing Python:

### Windows

To determine if your Windows computer already has Python 3:

1.  <span id="4838">Open a command prompt by entering command prompt in the Windows 10 search box and selecting the Command Prompt App in the Best match section of the results.</span>
2.  <span id="f6bc">Enter the following command and then select the Enter key:</span>
3.  <span id="24ec">ConsoleCopy</span>

`python --version`

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*59V2ZNbyJfsdGR2N20PM7w.png" class="graf-image" /></figure>1.  <span id="e87f">Running `python --version` may not return a value, or may return an error message stating *‘python’ is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.* This indicates Python is not installed on your Windows system.</span>
2.  <span id="7c04">If you see the word `Python` with a set of numbers separated by `.` characters, some version of Python is installed.</span>

#### i.e.

> `Python 3.8.0`

**As long as the first number is** `3`, you have Python 3 installed.

### Python

-   <span id="c462">Python is an interpreted, high-level and general-purpose, dynamically typed programming language</span>
-   <span id="74e1">It is also Object oriented, modular oriented and a scripting language.</span>
-   <span id="6e0e">In Python, everything is considered as an Object.</span>
-   <span id="490d">A python file has an extension of .py</span>
-   <span id="2bd5">Python follows Indentation to separate code blocks instead of flower brackets({}).</span>
-   <span id="6434">We can run a python file by the following command in cmd(Windows) or shell(mac/linux).</span>
-   <span id="b76b">`python <filename.py>`</span>

#### By default, the python doesn’t require any imports to run a python file.

### Create and execute a program

1.  <span id="d7b7">Open up a terminal/cmd</span>
2.  <span id="a7a7">Create the program: nano/cat &gt; <a href="http://nameprogram.py/" class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor">nameProgram.py</a></span>
3.  <span id="aace">Write the program and save it</span>
4.  <span id="b439">python <a href="http://nameprogram.py/" class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor">nameProgram.py</a></span>

### List

-   <span id="a311">List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.</span>
-   <span id="cd75">Lists are created using square brackets:</span>

<!-- -->

    thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

-   <span id="8afd">List items are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values.</span>
-   <span id="668d">List items are indexed, the first item has index `[0]`, the second item has index `[1]` etc.</span>
-   <span id="b8c7">The list is changeable, meaning that we can change, add, and remove items in a list after it has been created.</span>
-   <span id="b5f4">To determine how many items a list has, use the `len()` function.</span>
-   <span id="7dff">A list can contain different data types:</span>

<!-- -->

    list1 = ["abc", 34, True, 40, "male"]

-   <span id="9e81">It is also possible to use the list() constructor when creating a new list</span>

<!-- -->

    thislist = list(("apple", "banana", "cherry"))  # note the double round-brackets

### Tuple

-   <span id="50ea">Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.</span>
-   <span id="14ac">A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable.</span>
-   <span id="8cde">Tuples are written with round brackets.</span>

<!-- -->

    thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")

-   <span id="3e58">Tuple items are ordered, unchangeable, and allow duplicate values.</span>
-   <span id="2f5a">Tuple items are indexed, the first item has index `[0]`, the second item has index `[1]` etc.</span>
-   <span id="6f87">When we say that tuples are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.</span>
-   <span id="709a">Tuples are unchangeable, meaning that we cannot change, add or remove items after the tuple has been created.</span>
-   <span id="134b">Since tuple are indexed, tuples can have items with the same value:</span>
-   <span id="2720">Tuples allow duplicate values:</span>

<!-- -->

    thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple", "cherry")

-   <span id="ddae">To determine how many items a tuple has, use the `len()`function:</span>

<!-- -->

    thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
    print(len(thistuple))

-   <span id="2723">To create a tuple with only one item, you have to add a comma after the item, otherwise Python will not recognize it as a tuple.</span>

<!-- -->

    thistuple = ("apple",)
    print(type(thistuple))

    #NOT a tuple
    thistuple = ("apple")
    print(type(thistuple))

-   <span id="4556">It is also possible to use the tuple() constructor to make a tuple.</span>

<!-- -->

    thistuple = tuple(("apple", "banana", "cherry")) # note the double round-brackets
    print(thistuple)

### Set

-   <span id="1991">Set is a collection which is unordered and unindexed. No duplicate members.</span>
-   <span id="d108">A set is a collection which is both unordered and unindexed.</span>

<!-- -->

    thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}

-   <span id="4098">Set items are unordered, unchangeable, and do not allow duplicate values.</span>
-   <span id="b4d0">Unordered means that the items in a set do not have a defined order.</span>
-   <span id="d081">Set items can appear in a different order every time you use them, and cannot be referred to by index or key.</span>
-   <span id="4f53">Sets are unchangeable, meaning that we cannot change the items after the set has been created.</span>
-   <span id="812b">Duplicate values will be ignored.</span>
-   <span id="3ac9">To determine how many items a set has, use the `len()` method.</span>

<!-- -->

    thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}

    print(len(thisset))

-   <span id="b34e">Set items can be of any data type:</span>

<!-- -->

    set1 = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
    set2 = {1, 5, 7, 9, 3}
    set3 = {True, False, False}
    set4 = {"abc", 34, True, 40, "male"}

-   <span id="2a23">It is also possible to use the `set()` constructor to make a set.</span>

<!-- -->

    thisset = set(("apple", "banana", "cherry")) # note the double round-brackets

### Dictionary

-   <span id="3c14">Dictionary is a collection which is unordered and changeable. No duplicate members.</span>
-   <span id="cf8a">Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs.</span>
-   <span id="bbb2">Dictionaries are written with curly brackets, and have keys and values:</span>

<!-- -->

    thisdict = {
      "brand": "Ford",
      "model": "Mustang",
      "year": 1964
    }

-   <span id="7f11">Dictionary items are presented in key:value pairs, and can be referred to by using the key name.</span>

<!-- -->

    thisdict = {
      "brand": "Ford",
      "model": "Mustang",
      "year": 1964
    }
    print(thisdict["brand"])

-   <span id="8700">Dictionaries are changeable, meaning that we can change, add or remove items after the dictionary has been created.</span>
-   <span id="ea7e">Dictionaries cannot have two items with the same key.</span>
-   <span id="1ad4">Duplicate values will overwrite existing values.</span>
-   <span id="7582">To determine how many items a dictionary has, use the `len()` function.</span>

<!-- -->

    print(len(thisdict))

-   <span id="305d">The values in dictionary items can be of any data type</span>

<!-- -->

    thisdict = {
      "brand": "Ford",
      "electric": False,
      "year": 1964,
      "colors": ["red", "white", "blue"]
    }

### Conditional branching

    if condition:
            pass
        elif condition2:
            pass
        else:
            pass

### Loops

Python has two primitive loop commands:

1.  <span id="cd2b">while loops</span>
2.  <span id="f858">for loops</span>

#### While loop

-   <span id="e9e1">With the `while` loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.</span>
-   <span id="ef71">Example: Print i as long as i is less than 6</span>

<!-- -->

    i = 1
    while i < 6:
      print(i)
      i += 1

-   <span id="5f4a">The while loop requires relevant variables to be ready, in this example we need to define an indexing variable, i, which we set to 1.</span>
-   <span id="2dce">With the `break` statement we can stop the loop even if the while condition is true</span>
-   <span id="371e">With the continue statement we can stop the current iteration, and continue with the next.</span>
-   <span id="3dcf">With the else statement we can run a block of code once when the condition no longer is true.</span>

#### For loop

-   <span id="0fa5">A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).</span>
-   <span id="871e">This is less like the for keyword in other programming languages, and works more like an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming languages.</span>
-   <span id="ca9c">With the for loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc.</span>

<!-- -->

    fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
    for x in fruits:
      print(x)

-   <span id="19c1">The for loop does not require an indexing variable to set beforehand.</span>
-   <span id="fb47">To loop through a set of code a specified number of times, we can use the range() function.</span>
-   <span id="f32d">The range() function returns a sequence of numbers, starting from 0 by default, and increments by 1 (by default), and ends at a specified number.</span>
-   <span id="b8d4">The range() function defaults to increment the sequence by 1, however it is possible to specify the increment value by adding a third parameter: range(2, 30, 3).</span>
-   <span id="cca5">The else keyword in a for loop specifies a block of code to be executed when the loop is finished.  
    A nested loop is a loop inside a loop.</span>
-   <span id="acbb">The “inner loop” will be executed one time for each iteration of the “outer loop”:</span>

<!-- -->

    adj = ["red", "big", "tasty"]
    fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

    for x in adj:
      for y in fruits:
        print(x, y)

-   <span id="1bdd">for loops cannot be empty, but if you for some reason have a for loop with no content, put in the pass statement to avoid getting an error.</span>

<!-- -->

    for x in [0, 1, 2]:
      pass

### Function definition

    def function_name():
        return

### Function call

    function_name()

-   <span id="a1ca">We need not to specify the return type of the function.</span>
-   <span id="89e4">Functions by default return `None`</span>
-   <span id="7041">We can return any datatype.</span>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Python Syntax

Python syntax was made for readability, and easy editing. For example, the python language uses a `:` and indented code, while javascript and others generally use `{}` and indented code.

### First Program

Lets create a <a href="https://repl.it/languages/python3" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">python 3</a> repl, and call it *Hello World*. Now you have a blank file called *main.py*. Now let us write our first line of code:

    print('Hello world!')

> *Brian Kernighan actually wrote the first “Hello, World!” program as part of the documentation for the BCPL programming language developed by Martin Richards.*

Now, press the run button, which obviously runs the code. If you are not using replit, this will not work. You should research how to run a file with your text editor.

### Command Line

If you look to your left at the console where hello world was just printed, you can see a `>`, `>>>`, or `$` depending on what you are using. After the prompt, try typing a line of code.

    Python 3.6.1 (default, Jun 21 2017, 18:48:35)
    [GCC 4.9.2] on linux
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    > print('Testing command line')
    Testing command line
    > print('Are you sure this works?')
    Are you sure this works?
    >

The command line allows you to execute single lines of code at a time. It is often used when trying out a new function or method in the language.

### New: Comments!

Another cool thing that you can generally do with all languages, are comments. In python, a comment starts with a `#`. The computer ignores all text starting after the `#`.

`# Write some comments!`

If you have a huge comment, do **not** comment all the 350 lines, just put `'''` before it, and `'''` at the end. Technically, this is not a comment but a string, but the computer still ignores it, so we will use it.

### New: Variables!

Unlike many other languages, there is no `var`, `let`, or `const` to declare a variable in python. You simply go `name = 'value'`.

Remember, there is a difference between integers and strings. *Remember: String =* `""`*.* To convert between these two, you can put an int in a `str()` function, and a string in a `int()` function. There is also a less used one, called a float. Mainly, these are integers with decimals. Change them using the `float()` command.

<a href="https://repl.it/@bgoonz/second-scr?lite=true&amp;amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fbryanguner.medium.com" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">https://repl.it/<span class="citation" data-cites="bgoonz/second-scr?lite">@bgoonz/second-scr?lite</span>=true&amp;amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fbryanguner.medium.com</a>

    x = 5
    x = str(x)
    b = '5'
    b = int(b)
    print('x = ', x, '; b = ', str(b), ';') # => x = 5; b = 5;

Instead of using the `,` in the print function, you can put a `+` to combine the variables and string.

### Operators

There are many operators in python:

-   <span id="d553">`+`</span>
-   <span id="a1b3">`-`</span>
-   <span id="f09c">`/`</span>
-   <span id="cd1e">`*`  
    These operators are the same in most languages, and allow for addition, subtraction, division, and multiplicaiton.  
    Now, we can look at a few more complicated ones:</span>

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*oVIDxWdgJXoIt7CI.jpg" class="graf-image" /></figure>*simpleops.py*

    x = 4
    a = x + 1
    a = x - 1
    a = x * 2
    a = x / 2

You should already know everything shown above, as it is similar to other languages. If you continue down, you will see more complicated ones.

*complexop.py*

    a += 1
    a -= 1
    a *= 2
    a /= 2

The ones above are to edit the current value of the variable.  
Sorry to JS users, as there is no `i++;` or anything.

### Fun Fact: The python language was named after Monty Python.

If you really want to know about the others, view <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_basic_operators.htm" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">Py Operators</a>

### More Things With Strings

Like the title?  
Anyways, a `'` and a `"` both indicate a string, but **do not combine them!**

*quotes.py*

    x = 'hello' # Good
    x = "hello" # Good
    x = "hello' # ERRORRR!!!

*slicing.py*

### String Slicing

You can look at only certain parts of the string by slicing it, using `[num:num]`.  
The first number stands for how far in you go from the front, and the second stands for how far in you go from the back.

    x = 'Hello everybody!'
    x[1] # 'e'
    x[-1] # '!'
    x[5] # ' '
    x[1:] # 'ello everybody!'
    x[:-1] # 'Hello everybod'
    x[2:-3] # 'llo everyb'

### Methods and Functions

Here is a list of functions/methods we will go over:

-   <span id="aaaa">`.strip()`</span>
-   <span id="b3ee">`len()`</span>
-   <span id="c5cc">`.lower()`</span>
-   <span id="3466">`.upper()`</span>
-   <span id="a06d">`.replace()`</span>
-   <span id="57b6">`.split()`</span>

<em>Python in the browser. No installation required.</em>trinket.io</a><a href="https://trinket.io/python3/2b693977e7" class="js-mixtapeImage mixtapeImage mixtapeImage--empty u-ignoreBlock"></a>

### New: Input()

Input is a function that gathers input entered from the user in the command line. It takes one optional parameter, which is the users prompt.

*inp.py*

    print('Type something: ')
    x = input()
    print('Here is what you said: ', x)

If you wanted to make it smaller, and look neater to the user, you could do…

*inp2.py*

    print('Here is what you said: ', input('Type something: '))

Running:  
*inp.py*

    Type something:
    Hello World
    Here is what you said: Hello World

*inp2.py*

    Type something: Hello World
    Here is what you said: Hello World

### New: Importing Modules

Python has created a lot of functions that are located in other .py files. You need to import these **modules** to gain access to the,, You may wonder why python did this. The purpose of separate modules is to make python faster. Instead of storing millions and millions of functions, , it only needs a few basic ones. To import a module, you must write `input <modulename>`. Do not add the .py extension to the file name. In this example , we will be using a python created module named random.

*module.py*

    import random

Now, I have access to all functions in the random.py file. To access a specific function in the module, you would do `<module>.<function>`. For example:

*module2.py*

    import random
    print(random.randint(3,5)) # Prints a random number between 3 and 5

> *Pro Tip:  
> Do* `from random import randint` *to not have to do* `random.randint()`*, just* `randint()`\*  
> To import all functions from a module, you could do\* `from random import *`

### New: Loops!

Loops allow you to repeat code over and over again. This is useful if you want to print Hi with a delay of one second 100 times.

#### `for` Loop

The for loop goes through a list of variables, making a seperate variable equal one of the list every time.  
Let’s say we wanted to create the example above.

*loop.py*

    from time import sleep
    for i in range(100):
         print('Hello')
         sleep(.3)

This will print Hello with a .3 second delay 100 times. This is just one way to use it, but it is usually used like this:

*loop2.py*

    import time
    for number in range(100):
         print(number)
         time.sleep(.1)

<a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/replit/images/1539649280875_37d22e6d49e8e8fbc453631def345387.pn" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">https://storage.googleapis.com/replit/images/1539649280875_37d22e6d49e8e8fbc453631def345387.pn</a>

#### `while` Loop

The while loop runs the code while something stays true. You would put `while <expression>`. Every time the loop runs, it evaluates if the expression is True. It it is, it runs the code, if not it continues outside of the loop. For example:

*while.py*

    while True: # Runs forever
         print('Hello World!')

Or you could do:

*while2.py*

    import random
    position = '<placeholder>'
    while position != 1: # will run at least once
        position = random.randint(1, 10)
        print(position)

### New: `if` Statement

The if statement allows you to check if something is True. If so, it runs the code, if not, it continues on. It is kind of like a while loop, but it executes **only once**. An if statement is written:

*if.py*

    import random
    num = random.randint(1, 10)
    if num == 3:
         print('num is 3. Hooray!!!')
    if num > 5:
         print('Num is greater than 5')
    if num == 12:
         print('Num is 12, which means that there is a problem with the python language, see if you can figure it out. Extra credit if you can figure it out!')

Now, you may think that it would be better if you could make it print only one message. Not as many that are True. You can do that with an `elif` statement:

*elif.py*

    import random
    num = random.randint(1, 10)
    if num == 3:
        print('Num is three, this is the only msg you will see.')
    elif num > 2:
        print('Num is not three, but is greater than 1')

Now, you may wonder how to run code if none work. Well, there is a simple statement called `else:`

*else.py*

    import random
    num = random.randint(1, 10)
    if num == 3:
        print('Num is three, this is the only msg you will see.')
    elif num > 2:
        print('Num is not three, but is greater than 1')
    else:
        print('No category')

### New: Functions (`def`)

So far, you have only seen how to use functions other people have made. Let use the example that you want to print the a random number between 1 and 9, and print different text every time.  
It is quite tiring to type:

Characters: 389

*nofunc.py*

    import random
    print(random.randint(1, 9))
    print('Wow that was interesting.')
    print(random.randint(1, 9))
    print('Look at the number above ^')
    print(random.randint(1, 9))
    print('All of these have been interesting numbers.')
    print(random.randint(1, 9))
    print("these random.randint's are getting annoying to type")
    print(random.randint(1, 9))
    print('Hi')
    print(random.randint(1, 9))
    print('j')

Now with functions, you can seriously lower the amount of characters:

Characters: 254

*functions.py*

    import random
    def r(t):
         print(random.randint(1, 9))
         print(t)
    r('Wow that was interesting.')
    r('Look at the number above ^')
    r('All of these have been interesting numbers.')
    r("these random.randint's are getting annoying to type")
    r('Hi')
    r('j')

### Project Based Learning:

The following is a modified version of a tutorial posted By: <a href="https://replit.com/@InvisibleOne" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">InvisibleOne</a>

I would cite the original tutorial it’s self but at the time of this writing I can no longer find it on his repl.it profile and so the only reference I have are my own notes from following the tutorial when I first found it.

### 1. Adventure Story

The first thing you need with an adventure story is a great storyline, something that is exciting and fun. The idea is, that at each pivotal point in the story, you give the player the opportunity to make a choice.  
First things first, let’s import the stuff that we need, like this:

    import os   #very useful for clearing the screen
    import random

Now, we need some variables to hold some of the player data.

    name = input(“Name Please:  “) #We’ll use this to get the name from the user
    nickname = input(“Nickname: “)

Ok, now we have the player’s name and nickname, let’s welcome them to the game

    print(“Hello and welcome “ + name)

Now for the story. The most important part of all stories is the introduction, so let’s print our introduction

    print(“Long ago, there was a magical meal known as Summuh and Spich Atip”) #We can drop a line by making a new print statement, or we can use the escape code \n
    print(“It was said that this meal had the power to save lives, restore peace, and stop evil\nBecuase it was so powerful, it was hidden away on a mountain that could not be climbed\nBut it’s power brought unwanted attention, and a great war broke out.\nFinally, the leaders of the good side chose a single hero to go and find the Summah and Spich Atip, that hero was “ + name + “\n so ” + nickname + ‘ headed out to find this great power, and stop the war…’)

Now, we’ll give the player their first choice

    print(“After hiking through the wastelands for a long time, you come to a massive ravine, there is only a single way across\nA rickety old bridge, taking that could be very dangerous, but… maybe you could jump across?”)
    choice1 = input(“[1]  Take the bridge     [2] Try and jump over”)
    #Now we check to see what the player chose
    If choice1 == ‘1’:
      print(“You slowly walk across the bride, it creakes ominously, then suddenly breaks! You flail through the air before hitting the ground a thousand feet below. Judging by the fact that you hit the ground with the equivalent force of being hit by a cement truck moving at 125 miles an hour, you are dead…”)
      #The player lost, so now we’ll boot them out of the program with the exit command
      exit()
    #Then we check to see if they made the other choice, we can do with with else if, written as elif
    elif choice1 == ‘2’:
      print(“You make the jump! You see a feather hit the bridge, the weight breakes it and sends it to the bottom of the ravine\nGood thing you didn’t use that bridge.”)
    #Now we can continue the story
    print(“A few more hours of travel and you come to the unclimbable mountain.”)
    choice2 == input(“[1]   Give up    [2]    Try and climb the mountain”)
    if choice2 == ‘1’:
      print(“You gave up and lost…”)
      #now we exit them again
      exit()
    elif choice2 == ‘1’:
      print(“you continue up the mountain. Climbing is hard, but finally you reach the top.\nTo your surprise there is a man standing at the top of the mountain, he is very old.”)
      print(“Old Man: Hey “ + nickname)
      print(“You: How do you know my name!?!”)
      print(“Old Man: Because you have a name tag on…”)
      print(“You: Oh, well, were is the Summuh and Spich Atip?”)
      print(“Old Man: Summuh and Spich Atip? You must mean the Pita Chips and Hummus”)
      print(“You: Pita…chips…humus, what power do those have?”)
      print(“Old Man: Pretty simple kid, their organic…”)
      #Now let’s clear the screen
      os.system(‘clear’)
      print(“YOU WON!!!”)

There you have it, a pretty simple choose your own ending story. You can make it as complex or uncomplex as you like.

### 2. TEXT ENCODER

Ever make secret messages as a kid? I used to. Anyways, here’s the way you can make a program to encode messages! It’s pretty simple. First things first, let’s get the message the user wants to encode, we’ll use input() for that:

    message = input(“Message you would like encoded: “)

Now we need to split that string into a list of characters, this part is a bit more complicated.

    #We’ll make a function, so we can use it later
    def split(x):
      return (char for char in x)
    #now we’ll call this function with our text
    L_message = message.lower() #This way we can lower any of their input
    encode = split(l_message)

Now we need to convert the characters into code, well do this with a for loop:

    out = []
    for x in encode:
      if x == ‘a’:
        out.append(‘1’)
      elif x == ‘b’:
        out.append(‘2’)
    #And we’ll continue on though this with each letter of the alphabet

Once we’ve encoded the text, we’ll print it back for the user

    x = ‘ ‘.join(out)
    #this will turn out into a string that we can print
    print(x)

And if you want to decode something, it is this same process but in reverse!

### 3. Guess my Number

Number guessing games are fun and pretty simple, all you need are a few loops. To start, we need to import random.

    import random

That is pretty simple. Now we’ll make a list with the numbers were want available for the game

    num_list = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

Next, we get a random number from the list

    num = random.choice(num_list)

Now, we need to ask the user for input, we’ll to this with a while loop

    while True:
      # We could use guess = input(“What do you think my number is?   “), but that would produce a string, and numbers are integers, so we’ll convert the input into an integer
      guess = int(input(“What do you think my number is?   “))
      #Next, we’ll check if that number is equal to the number we picked
      if guess == num:
        break   #this will remove us from the loop, so we can display the win message
      else:
        print(“Nope, that isn’t it”)
    #outside our loop, we’ll have the win message that is displayed if the player gets the correct number. 
    print(“You won!”)

Have fun with this!

### 4. Notes

Here is a more advanced project, but still pretty easy. This will be using a txt file to save some notes. The first thing we need to do is to create a txt file in your repl, name it ‘notes.txt’  
Now, to open a file in python we use open(‘filename’, type) The type can be ‘r’ for read, or ‘w’ for write. There is another option, but we won’t be using that here. Now, the first thing we are going to do is get what the user would like to save:

    message = input(“What would you like to save?”)

Now we’ll open our file and save that text

    o = open(‘notes.txt’, ‘w’)
    o.write(message)
    #this next part is very important, you need to always remember to close your file or what you wrote to it won’t be saved
    o.close()

There we go, now the information is in the file. Next, we’ll retrieve it

    read = open(‘notes.txt’, ‘r’)
    out = read.read()
    # now we need to close the file
    read.close()
    # and now print what we read
    print(out)

There we go, that’s how you can open files and close files with python

### 5. Random Dare Generator

Who doesn’t love a good dare? Here is a program that can generate random dares. The first thing we’ll need to do is as always, import random. Then we’ll make some lists of dares

    import random
    list1 = [‘jump on’, ‘sit on’, ‘rick roll on’, ‘stop on’, ‘swing on’]
    list2 = [‘your cat’, ‘your neighbor’, ‘a dog’, ‘a tree’, ‘a house’]
    list3 = [‘your mom’, ‘your best friend’, ‘your dad’, ‘your teacher’]
    #now we’ll generate a dare
    while True:
      if input() == ‘’: #this will trigger if they hit enter
        print(“I dare you to “ + random.choice(list1) + ‘ ‘ + random.choice(list2) + ‘ in front of ‘  + random.choice(list3)

### SCOPE:

-   <span id="8522">The `scope` of a program in JS is the set of variables that are available for use within the program.</span>
-   <span id="dc76">Scope in JavaScript defines which variables and functions you have access to, depending on where you are (a *physical position*) within your code.</span>
-   <span id="1243">The current context of execution. The context in which <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Value" class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor">values</a> and **expressions** are “visible” or can be referenced. If a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Variable" class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor"><strong>variable</strong></a> or other expression is not “in the current scope,” then it is unavailable for use. Scopes can also be layered in a hierarchy, so that child scopes have access to parent scopes, but not vice versa.</span>

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*RaM-5KbhUOZ_HoP5j-kNWQ.png" class="graf-image" /></figure>-   <span id="def6">A <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Function" class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor"><strong>function</strong></a> serves as a **closure** in <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/JavaScript" class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor">JavaScript</a>, and thus creates a scope, so that (for example) a variable defined exclusively within the function cannot be accessed from outside the function or within other functions:<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Scope" class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Scope</a></span>

In other parts of the program the name may refer to a different entity (it may have a different binding), or to nothing at all (it may be unbound). The scope of a name binding is also known as the **visibility** of an entity, particularly in older or more technical literature — this is from the perspective of the referenced entity, not the referencing name:<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_%28computer_science%29" class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_(computer_science)</a></span>

**Advantages of utilizing scope**

-   <span id="857d">`Security` : Adds security by ensuring variables can only be access by pre-defined parts of our program.</span>
-   <span id="a55d">`Reduced Variable Name Collisions` : Restricts re-using variable names; helps prevent overwriting variable names.</span>

### Lexical Scope

Lexical scope is the ability of the inner function to access the outer scope in which it is defined.

-   <span id="62b5">`Lexing Time` : When you run a piece of JS code that is parsed before it is run.</span>
-   <span id="9320">*Lexical environment* is a place where variables and functions live during the program execution.</span>

### Different Variables in JavaScript

-   <span id="25bd">*A variable always evaluates to the value it contains no matter how you declare it.*</span>

**The different ways to declare variables**

-   <span id="1cff">`let` : can be re-assigned; block-scoped.</span>
-   <span id="a2e4">`const` : no re-assignment; block scoped.</span>
-   <span id="c933">`var` : May or may not be re-assigned; scoped to a function.</span>

**Hoisting and Scoping with Variables**

`Hoisting` is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope before code execution.

### &&

### !!! Only variables declared with var are hoisted!!!!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Slightly modified excerpt from:

#### <a href="https://ui.dev/ultimate-guide-to-execution-contexts-hoisting-scopes-and-closures-in-javascript/" class="markup--anchor markup--h4-anchor">source</a> : https://ui.dev/ultimate-guide-to-execution-contexts-hoisting-scopes-and-closures-in-javascript/

The first *Execution Context* ( a word that we don’t have to worry about the exact meaning of yet) that gets created when the JavaScript engine runs your code is called the “Global Execution Context”.

Initially this Execution Context will consist of two things —

-   <span id="ba1b">**a global object**</span>

> ***and***

-   <span id="bdfe">***a* variable called** `this`.</span>

> By default the`this` keyword will act as a reference to global object which will be `window` if you’re running JavaScript in the browser or `global` if you’re running it in a Node environment.

### REMEMBER:

> Node: `this` references a global object called ***window*** (like the window that comprises the content of a tab in chrome)

> Browsers:`this` references a global object called ***global***

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*NMGRtcYlwffqSUSH.png" class="graf-image" /></figure>Above we can see that even without any code, the Global Execution Context will still consist of two things — `window` and `this`. This is the Global Execution Context in its most basic form.

Let’s step things up and see what happens when we start actually adding code to our program. Let’s start with adding a few variables.

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*P8DG5hIKJO7thsnz.png" class="graf-image" /></figure><figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*J9juq03-KlcKReSF.png" class="graf-image" /></figure>The key take away is that each Execution Context has two separate phases, a `Creation` phase and an `Execution` phase and each phase has its own unique responsibilities.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Exaction Context:

#### Execution Context ≠(NOT EQUAL)≠≠≠Scope

1.  <span id="0fcc">The **global execution context** is created ***before*** any code is executed.</span>
2.  <span id="de32">Whenever a function is *executed* invoked (this means the function is told to run… i.e. after the doSomething function has been declared … calling ‘doSomething()’, a **new execution context** gets created.</span>
3.  <span id="20c3">**Every** execution context provides `this` keyword, which points to an **object** to which the current code that’s being executed belongs.</span>

For more info read about <a href="https://medium.com/@Rahulx1/understanding-event-loop-call-stack-event-job-queue-in-javascript-63dcd2c71ecd" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">Event Queue and Call Stack</a>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### More formal definition from: <a href="https://codeburst.io/js-demystified-04-execution-context-97dea52c8ac6" class="markup--anchor markup--h4-anchor">Misa Ogura’s article on the subject</a>

In JavaScript, **execution context** is an abstract concept that holds *information about the environment* within which the current code is being executed.

**Remember**: the JavaScript engine creates the global execution context before it starts to execute any code. From that point on, a new execution context gets created *every time* a function is executed, as the engine parses through your code. In fact, the global execution context is nothing special. It’s just like any other execution context, except that it gets created by default.

In the Global `Creation` phase, the JavaScript engine will

1.  <span id="0634">Create a global object.</span>
2.  <span id="ed12">Create an object called “this”.</span>
3.  <span id="b1a7">Set up memory space for variables and functions.</span>
4.  <span id="7656">Assign variable declarations a default value of “undefined” while placing any function declarations in memory.</span>

**It’s not until the** `Execution` **phase where the JavaScript engine starts running your code line by line and executing it.**

We can see this flow from `Creation` **phase to** `Execution` **phase** in the GIF **below.** 🠗🠗🠗🠗🠗🠗

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*QHJcijvusr0_rqAH.gif" class="graf-image" /></figure>During the `Creation` phase:

**The JavaScript engine said ‘let there be** `window` **and** `this`‘

> and there was `window` and `this`… and it was good

Once the `window` and `this` are created;

Variable declarations are assigned a default value of `undefined`

Any function declarations (`getUser`) are placed entirely into memory.

**Exaction Phase:**

Then once we enter the `Execution` phase, the JavaScript engine starts executing the code line by line and assigns the real values to the variables already living in memory.

### **Function-Scoped Variables**

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*blt2vI9_uDtV7_pM9Cclkg.png" class="graf-image" /></figure>Function scope means that parameters and variables defined in a function are visible everywhere within the function, but are not visible outside of the function.

Consider the next function that auto-executes, called IIFE.

    (function autoexecute() {
        let x = 1;
    })();
    console.log(x);

    //Uncaught ReferenceError: x is not defined
    IIFE stands for Immediately Invoked Function Expression and is a function that runs immediately after its definition.
    Variables declared with var have only function scope. Even more, variables declared with var are hoisted to the top of their scope. This way they can be accessed before being declared. Take a look at the code below:
    function doSomething(){
      console.log(x);
      var x = 1;
    }
    doSomething(); //undefined
    This does not happen for let. A variable declared with let can be accessed only after its definition.
    function doSomething(){
      console.log(x);
      let x = 1;
    }
    doSomething();

    //Uncaught ReferenceError: x is not defined
    A variable declared with var can be re-declared multiple times in the same scope. The following code is just fine:
    function doSomething(){
      var x = 1
      var x = 2;
      console.log(x);
    }
    doSomething();
    Variables declared with let or const cannot be re-declared in the same scope:
    function doSomething(){
      let x = 1
      let x = 2;
    }
    //Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier 'x' has already been declared

Maybe we don’t even have to care about this, as `var` has started to become obsolete.

-   <span id="504b">Only the var keyword creates function-scoped variables (however a var declared variable may be globally scoped if it is declared outside of a nested function in the global scope), this means our declared var keyword variable will be confined to the scope of our current function.</span>

Why you shouldn’t use var:

1.  <span id="491f">No error is thrown if you declare the same variable twice using var (conversely, both let and const will throw an error if a variable is declared twice)</span>
2.  <span id="b04e">Variables declared with var are not block scoped (although they are function scoped), while with let and const they are. This is important because what’s the point of block scoping if you’re not going to use it. So using var in this context would require a situation in which a variable declared inside a function would need to be used in the global scope. I’m not able to think of any situations where that would be absolutely necessary, but perhaps they exist.</span>

### REMEMBER:

### Var===🗑🚮👎🏽🤮

    function test() {
      // var hoistedVar;
      console.log(hoistedVar); // =>  undefined
      var hoistedVar = 10;
    }

-   <span id="b52d">Even though we initially declared & initialized our variable underneath the console.log var variables are “hoisted” to the top, but only in declaration (default value undefined until the exaction arrives at the line on which it was initialized.</span>

### Scope Spaced Repetition:

Scope is defined as which variables we currently have access to and where. So far in this course, we have mostly been working in `global` scope, in that we can access any variable we have created, anywhere in our code. There are a couple different levels of scope: `block` level scope is used in `if` statements and `for` loops. In `block` level scope, a variable declared using either `let` or `const` is only available within the statement or loop (like `i` in a `for` loop). Similarly, there is function scope, where `temperature` exists inside the function, but not elsewhere in your code file.

### More on hoisting:

#### source: <a href="https://blog.bitsrc.io/hoisting-in-modern-javascript-let-const-and-var-b290405adfda" class="markup--anchor markup--h4-anchor"><em>Hoisting in Modern JavaScript — let, const, and var</em></a>

    helloWorld();  // prints 'Hello World!' to the consolefunction helloWorld(){
      console.log('Hello World!');
    }

Function declarations are added to the memory during the compile stage, so we are able to access it in our code before the actual function declaration

When the JavaScript engine encounters a call to `helloWorld()`, it will look into the lexical environment, finds the function and will be able to execute it.

### Hoisting Function Expressions

Only function declarations are hoisted in JavaScript, function expressions are not hoisted. For example: this code won’t work.

    helloWorld();  // TypeError: helloWorld is not a functionvar helloWorld = function(){
      console.log('Hello World!');
    }

As JavaScript only hoist declarations, not initializations (assignments), so the `helloWorld`will be treated as a variable, not as a function. Because `helloWorld` is a `var` variable, so the engine will assign is the `undefined` value during hoisting.

So this code will work.

    var helloWorld = function(){
      console.log('Hello World!');  prints 'Hello World!'
    }helloWorld();

### Hoisting var variables:

Let’s look at some examples to understand hoisting in case of `var` variables.

    console.log(a); // outputs 'undefined'
    var a = 3;

We expected `3` but instead got `undefined`. Why?

Remember JavaScript only hoist declarations, not initializations*.* That is, during compile time, JavaScript only stores function and variable declarations in the memory, not their assignments (value).

**But why** `undefined`**?**

When JavaScript engine finds a `var` variable declaration during the compile phase, it will add that variable to the lexical environment and initialize it with `undefined` and later during the execution when it reaches the line where the actual assignment is done in the code, it will assign that value to the variable.

### **Block-Scoped Variables**

Things that create block-scopes:

-   <span id="66e4">If Statements</span>
-   <span id="9a99">While Loops</span>
-   <span id="dc88">Switch Statements</span>
-   <span id="c5fb">For Loops</span>
-   <span id="089b">Curly Boiz **‘{}’ ….. anything between cury brackets is scoped to within those brackets.**</span>

-   <span id="5c6a">Use the proper declarations to manage your code: Avoid being a sloppy programmer!</span>

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*hpZDzz--eVsA-3o7.png" class="graf-image" /></figure>Variables defined outside any function, block, or module scope have global scope. Variables in global scope can be accessed from everywhere in the application.

When a module system is enabled it’s harder to make global variables, but one can still do it. By defining a variable in HTML, outside any function, a global variable can be created:

When there is no module system in place, it is a lot easier to create global variables. A variable declared outside any function, in any file, is a global variable.

Global variables are available for the lifetime of the application.

Another way for creating a global variable is to use the `window` global object anywhere in the application:

    window.GLOBAL_DATA = { value: 1 };

At this point, the `GLOBAL_DATA` variable is visible everywhere.

    console.log(GLOBAL_DATA)

As you can imagine these practices are bad practices.

#### \*Module scope

Before modules, a variable declared outside any function was a global variable. In modules, a variable declared outside any function is hidden and not available to other modules unless it is explicitly exported.

Exporting makes a function or object available to other modules. In the next example, I export a function from the `sequence.js` module file:

    // in sequence.js
    export { sequence, toList, take };

Importing makes a function or object, from other modules, available to the current module.

    import { sequence, toList, toList } from "./sequence";

In a way, we can imagine a module as a self-executing function that takes the import data as inputs and returns the export data.

### OVERVIEW

Let’s look at the Window/Console in a browser/node environment. Type `window` to your chrome console. JavaScript is executed in this context, also known as the `global scope`.

There are two types of scope in javascript, `Global Vs. Local` and that this is important to understand in terms of a computer program written in JavaScript.

When a function is declared and created, a new `scope` is also created. Any variables declared within that function’s scope will be `enclosed` in a lexical/private scope that belongs to that function. Also, it is important to remember that functions look `outward` for context. If some variable isn’t defined in a function’s scope, the function will look outside the scope chain and search for a variable being referenced in the outer scope. This is what closure is all about.

In it’s most simplest of forms this is a closure:

    const foo = 'bar';
    function returnFoo () {
      return foo;
    }
    returnFoo();
    // -> reaches outside its scope to find foo because it doesn't exist inside of return Foo's scope when foo is referenced.

The function body (code inside returnFoo) has access to the outside scope (code outside of returnFoo) and can access that ‘foo’ variable.

Let’s look at another example:

    const lastName = 'Bob';
    function greet() {
      const firstName = 'Jim';
      alert(`The name's ${lastName}, ${firstName} ${lastName}`);
    }
    console.log(lastName);

Not much different than the idea presented above, but the thought remains the same. When ‘greet’ is called, it has no context in its local scope of finding `lastName` so, it looks outside its scope to find it and use the `lastName` that is found there.

Let’s take this a step further. In the given examples, we’ve seen that we have created two environments for our code. The first would be the global environment where `lastName` and `greet` exist. The second would be the local environment where the alert function is called. Let’s represent those two environments like this:

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*fpIwHvwpDYxatfE9.png" class="graf-image" /></figure>### What is a closure?

A closure is an inner function that has access to the outer (enclosing) function’s variables — scope chain. The closure has three scope chains: it has access to its own scope (variables defined between its curly brackets), it has access to the outer function’s variables, and it has access to the global variables.

The inner function has access not only to the outer function’s variables, but also to the outer function’s parameters. Note that the inner function cannot call the outer function’s arguments object, however, even though it can call the outer function’s parameters directly.

You create a closure by adding a function inside another function.

**A Basic Example:**

### Scope chain

Every scope has a link to the parent scope. When a variable is used, JavaScript looks down the scope chain until it either finds the requested variable or until it reaches the global scope, which is the end of the scope chain.

### Context in JavaScript

-   <span id="ac33">`Scope` : Refers to the visibility and availability of variables.</span>
-   <span id="3117">`Context` : Refers to the value of the `this` keyword when code is executed.</span>

Every function invocation has both a scope and a context. Even though technically functions are objects in JS, you can think of scope as pertaining to functions in which a variable was defined, and context as the object on which some variable or method (function) may exist. Scope describes a function has access to when it is invoked (unique to each invocation). Context is always the value of the `this` keyword which in turn is a reference to the object that a piece of code exists within.

Context is most often determined by how a function is invoked. When a function is called as a method of an object, `this` is set to the object the method is called on:

### `this`** ?**

-   <span id="2c6d">`This` : Keyword that exists in every function and evaluates to the object that is currently invoking that function.</span>
-   <span id="2b18">**Method-Style Invocation** : syntax goes like `object.method(arg)`. (i.e. array.push, str.toUpperCase()</span>
-   <span id="17bb">`Context` refers to the value of this within a function and `this` refers to where a function is invoked.</span>

**Issues with Scope and Context**

-   <span id="dd07">If `this` is called using normal function style invocation, our output will be the contents of the global object.</span>

**When Methods have an Unexpected Context**

-   <span id="bf17">In the above example we get undefined when we assign our this function to a variable bc there is no obj to reference except the global one!</span>

**Strictly Protecting the Global Object**

We can run JS in strict mode by tagging `use strict` at the top of our program.

-   <span id="3c6e">If we try to invoke this on our global function in strict mode we will no longer be able to access it and instead just get undefined.</span>

**Changing Context using Bind**

“The simplest use of `bind()` is to make a function that, no matter how it is called, is called with a particular this value”.

**Binding with Arguments**

-   <span id="208d">We can also use bind() to bind arguments to a function.</span>

### Arrow Functions (Fat Arrows)

side note … if you don’t know what this means ignore it… but if you write an arrow function that utilizes an implicit return… that’s roughly equivalent to what is referred to as a lambda function in other languages.

-   <span id="4190">`=>` : A more concise way of declaring a function and also considers the behavior of `this` and context.</span>

**Arrow Functions Solving Problems**

As you can see the arrow function is shorter and easier to read.

**Anatomy of an Arrow Function**

-   <span id="a35b">If there is only a single parameter there is no need to add parenthesis before the arrow function.</span>
-   <span id="e68f">However if there are zero parameters then you must add an empty set of parentheses.</span>

**Single Expression Arrow Functions**

-   <span id="635b">Arrow functions, *unlike* normal functions, carry over context, binding `this` lexically.</span>
-   <span id="b4db">Value of `this` inside an arrow function is not dependent on how it is invoked.</span>
-   <span id="4b3f">Because arrow functions already have a *bound context*, you can’t reassign `this`.</span>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Phewh… that’s a lot… let’s go over some of that again!

### Block Scope Review:

Block scope is defined with curly braces. It is separated by `{` and `}`.

Variables declared with `let` and `const` can have block scope. They can only be accessed in the block in which they are defined.

Consider the next code that emphasizes `let` block scope:

    let x = 1;
    { 
      let x = 2;
    }
    console.log(x); //1

In contrast, the `var` declaration has no block scope:

    var x = 1;
    { 
      var x = 2;
    }
    console.log(x); //2

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Closures Spaced Repetition

**1. Closures have access to the outer function’s variable even after the outer function returns:**

One of the most important features with closures is that the inner function still has access to the outer function’s variables even after the outer function has returned.

**When functions in JavaScript execute, they use the same scope chain that was in effect when they were created.**

This means that even after the outer function has returned, the inner function still has access to the outer function’s variables. Therefore, you can call the inner function later in your program.

See here:

**2. Closures store references to the outer function’s variables:**

> They do not store the actual value.

Closures get more interesting when the value of the outer function’s variable changes before the closure is called.

And this powerful feature can be harnessed in creative ways…namely private variables.

**3. Closures Gone Bad**

Because closures have access to the updated values of the outer function’s variables, they can also lead to bugs when the outer function’s variable changes with a for loop.

For example:

<span class="graf-dropCap">C</span>closure is a word we use to refer to the context of a given function. Normally our function starts from scratch every time we run it.

However, if we were to return a function from `addOne()` that referenced `counter`, counter would become part of the context of that new function, even after `addOne()` finishes executing. This is easier to see in code than to explain in words:

This works! we only instantiate counter when `createAdder()` is called, but it’s value gets updated whenever the function it returns is called.

> We say that this inner function is closed around the variable `counter`

> Definition*: (According to MDN) A closure is the combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Global Scope Spaced Repetition:

Scope in JavaScript works like it does in most languages. If something is defined at the root level, that’s global scope — we can *access (and modify)* that variable from anywhere. If it’s a function we defined, we can *call* it from anywhere.

### The Problem with Global Scope

So it seems we should declare all of our variables at the global scope.

> Why could this be a problem?

It seems reasonable to want `counter` to *only* be accessed/modified through our `addOne()` function, but if our variable is defined within the global scope, it’s simply not so.

This may not seem like a major concern — we can just make sure we don’t access it directly.

We need some form of encapsulation — i.e. the data our function relies on is *completely* contained within the logic of that function

### Inner Scope

OK, this seems to work as expected, however

> What about inside of our `addOne()` function?

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*hCP3tX_zDtTQLRQT.png" class="graf-image" /></figure>Every function creates it’s own local scope.

Compared to it’s context (i.e. *where* our function is defined), we call this the inner scope

Our function can access/modify anything outside of it’s scope, so the body of our function, `{         counter++; }`, has an effect that persists in the outside scope.

> What about the other way around…Can global scope modify inner scope?

Because `counter` is *defined* within our function’s scope, it doesn’t exist within the global scope, so referencing it there doesn’t make sense.

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*K-GktN0XO2Gw6BPK.png" class="graf-image" /></figure>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Context vs. Scope

The first important thing to clear up is that context and scope are not the same. I have noticed many developers over the years often confuse the two terms (myself included), incorrectly describing one for the other.

Every function invocation has both a scope and a context associated with it.

To condense it down to a single concept, scope is function-based while context is object-based.

#### In other words, scope pertains to the variable access of a function when it is invoked and is unique to each invocation. Context is always the value of the `this` keyword which is a reference to the object that “owns” the currently executing code.

### Variable Scope

A variable can be defined in either local or global scope, which establishes the variables’ accessibility from different scopes during runtime.

Local variables exist only within the function body of which they are defined and will have a different scope for every call of that function. There it is subject for value assignment, retrieval, and manipulation only within that call and is not accessible outside of that scope.

ECMAScript 6 (ES6/ES2015) introduced the `let` and `const` keywords that support the declaration of block scope local variables.

This means the variable will be confined to the scope of a block that it is defined in, such as an `if` statement or `for` loop and will not be accessible outside of the opening and closing curly braces of the block.

This is contrary to `var` declarations which are accessible outside blocks they are defined in.

The difference between `let` and `const` is that a `const` declaration is, as the name implies, constant - a read-only reference to a value.

#### This does not mean the value is immutable, just that the variable identifier cannot be reassigned.

### Closure Spaced Repetition:

#### recall:

<span class="graf-dropCap">L</span><a href="https://www.educative.io/edpresso/lexical-scope-in-javascript" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor"><strong>exical scope</strong></a> is the ability for a function scope to access variables from the parent scope. We call the child function to be lexically bound by that of the parent function.

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*5RWAkuw8fkbTV6MRabyfhQ.png" class="graf-image" /></figure>### AND

A *lexical environment* is an abstraction that holds **identifier-variable mapping**. I**dentifier** refers to the name of variables/functions, and **the variable** is the reference to actual object \[including function object\] or primitive value.

This is similar to an object with a method on it…

In the picture below… sayHi (and name) are identifiers and the function and (string “bryan”) are variable values.

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ewwHx4vO170sT3tneB--2A.png" class="graf-image" /></figure>#### Accessing variables outside of the immediate lexical scope creates a closure.

A closure is to put it simply, when a nested function is defined inside of another function gains access to the outer functions variables.

Returning the nested function from the ‘parent function’ that enclosed the nested function definition, allows you to maintain access to the local variables, (arguments, and potentially even more inner function declarations) of its outer function… without exposing the variables or arguments of outer function…. to any of the other functions that were not declared inside of it.

### What is “this” Context

Context is most often determined by how a function is invoked.

When a function is called as a method of an object, `this` is set to the object the method is called on:

The same principle applies when invoking a function with the `new` operator to create an instance of an object.

When invoked in this manner, the value of `this` within the scope of the function will be set to the newly created instance:

When called as an unbound function, `this` will default to the global context or window object in the browser. However, if the function is executed in *strict mode*, the context will default to undefined.

### Execution Context Spaced Repetition:

JavaScript is a single threaded language, meaning only one task can be executed at a time. When the JavaScript interpreter initially executes code, it first enters into a global execution context by default. Each invocation of a function from this point on will result in the creation of a new execution context.

This is where confusion often sets in, the term **“execution context” is actually for all intents and purposes referring more to scope and not context.**

It is an unfortunate naming convention, however it is the terminology as defined by the ECMAScript specification, so we’re kind of stuck with it.

Each time a new execution context is created it is appended to the top of the *execution stack (call stack).*

The browser will always execute the current execution context that is atop the execution stack. Once completed, it will be removed from the top of the stack and control will return to the execution context below.

An execution context can be divided into a creation and execution phase. In the creation phase, the interpreter will first create a *variable object* that is composed of all the variables, function declarations, and arguments defined inside the execution context.

From there the *scope chain* is initialized next, and the value of `this` is determined last. Then in the execution phase, code is interpreted and executed.

### Conclusion

Variables defined in global scope are available everywhere in the application.

In a module, a variable declared outside any function is hidden and not available to other modules unless it is explicitly exported.

Function scope means that parameters and variables defined in a function are visible everywhere within the function

Variables declared with `let` and `const` have block scope. `var` doesn’t have block scope.

    Data Structures… Under The Hood
    Data Structures Reference

    Data Structures… Under The Hood
    Data Structures Reference

    Array
    Stores things in order. Has quick lookups by index.
    Linked List
    Also stores things in order. Faster insertions and deletions than

    arrays, but slower lookups (you have to “walk down” the whole list).
    !
    Queue
    Like the line outside a busy restaurant. “First come, first served.”
    Stack
    Like a stack of dirty plates in the sink. The first one you take off the

    top is the last one you put down.
    Tree
    Good for storing hierarchies. Each node can have “child” nodes.
    Binary Search Tree
    Everything in the left subtree is smaller than the current node,

    everything in the right subtree is larger. lookups, but only if the tree

    is balanced!
    Binary Search Tree
    Graph
    Good for storing networks, geography, social relationships, etc.
    Heap
    A binary tree where the smallest value is always at the top. Use it to implement a priority queue.
    ![A binary heap is a binary tree where the nodes are organized to so that the smallest value is always at the top.]
    Adjacency list
    A list where the index represents the node and the value at that index is a list of the node’s neighbors:
    graph = [ [1], [0, 2, 3], [1, 3], [1, 2], ]
    Since node 3 has edges to nodes 1 and 2, graph[3] has the adjacency list [1, 2].
    We could also use a dictionary where the keys represent the node and the values are the lists of neighbors.
    graph = { 0: [1], 1: [0, 2, 3], 2: [1, 3], 3: [1, 2], }
    This would be useful if the nodes were represented by strings, objects, or otherwise didn’t map cleanly to list indices.
    Adjacency matrix
    A matrix of 0s and 1s indicating whether node x connects to node y (0 means no, 1 means yes).
    graph = [ [0, 1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1], [0, 1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 1, 0], ]
    Since node 3 has edges to nodes 1 and 2, graph[3][1] and graph[3][2] have value 1.
    a = LinkedListNode(5) b = LinkedListNode(1) c = LinkedListNode(9) a.next = b b.next = c

    Arrays
    Ok, so we know how to store individual numbers. Let’s talk about storing several numbers.
    That’s right, things are starting to heat up.
    Suppose we wanted to keep a count of how many bottles of kombucha we drink every day.
    Let’s store each day’s kombucha count in an 8-bit, fixed-width, unsigned integer. That should be plenty — we’re not likely to get through more than 256 (2⁸) bottles in a single day, right?
    And let’s store the kombucha counts right next to each other in RAM, starting at memory address 0:



    Bam. That’s an array. RAM is basically an array already.
    Just like with RAM, the elements of an array are numbered. We call that number the index of the array element (plural: indices). In this example, each array element’s index is the same as its address in RAM.
    But that’s not usually true. Suppose another program like Spotify had already stored some information at memory address 2:



    We’d have to start our array below it, for example at memory address 3. So index 0 in our array would be at memory address 3, and index 1 would be at memory address 4, etc.:



    Suppose we wanted to get the kombucha count at index 4 in our array. How do we figure out what address in memory to go to? Simple math:
    Take the array’s starting address (3), add the index we’re looking for (4), and that’s the address of the item we’re looking for. 3 + 4 = 7. In general, for getting the nth item in our array:
    \text{address of nth item in array} = \text{address of array start} + n
    This works out nicely because the size of the addressed memory slots and the size of each kombucha count are both 1 byte. So a slot in our array corresponds to a slot in RAM.
    But that’s not always the case. In fact, it’s usually not the case. We usually use 64-bit integers.
    So how do we build an array of 64-bit (8 byte) integers on top of our 8-bit (1 byte) memory slots?
    We simply give each array index 8 address slots instead of 1:



    So we can still use simple math to grab the start of the nth item in our array — just gotta throw in some multiplication:
    \text{address of nth item in array} = \text{address of array start} + (n * \text{size of each item in bytes})
    Don’t worry — adding this multiplication doesn’t really slow us down. Remember: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of fixed-width integers takes time. So all the math we’re using here to get the address of the nth item in the array takes time.
    And remember how we said the memory controller has a direct connection to each slot in RAM? That means we can read the stuff at any given memory address in time.



    Together, this means looking up the contents of a given array index is time. This fast lookup capability is the most important property of arrays.
    But the formula we used to get the address of the nth item in our array only works if:

    Each item in the array is the same size (takes up the same

    number of bytes).

    The array is uninterrupted (contiguous) in memory. There can’t

    be any gaps in the array…like to “skip over” a memory slot Spotify was already using.
    These things make our formula for finding the nth item work because they make our array predictable. We can predict exactly where in memory the nth element of our array will be.
    But they also constrain what kinds of things we can put in an array. Every item has to be the same size. And if our array is going to store a lot of stuff, we’ll need a bunch of uninterrupted free space in RAM. Which gets hard when most of our RAM is already occupied by other programs (like Spotify).
    That’s the tradeoff. Arrays have fast lookups ( time), but each item in the array needs to be the same size, and you need a big block of uninterrupted free memory to store the array.

    ## Pointers
    Remember how we said every item in an array had to be the same size? Let’s dig into that a little more.
    Suppose we wanted to store a bunch of ideas for baby names. Because we’ve got some really cute ones.
    Each name is a string. Which is really an array. And now we want to store those arrays in an array. Whoa.
    Now, what if our baby names have different lengths? That’d violate our rule that all the items in an array need to be the same size!
    We could put our baby names in arbitrarily large arrays (say, 13 characters each), and just use a special character to mark the end of the string within each array…



    “Wigglesworth” is a cute baby name, right?
    But look at all that wasted space after “Bill”. And what if we wanted to store a string that was more than 13 characters? We’d be out of luck.
    There’s a better way. Instead of storing the strings right inside our array, let’s just put the strings wherever we can fit them in memory. Then we’ll have each element in our array hold the address in memory of its corresponding string. Each address is an integer, so really our outer array is just an array of integers. We can call each of these integers a pointer, since it points to another spot in memory.



    The pointers are marked with a * at the beginning.
    Pretty clever, right? This fixes both the disadvantages of arrays:

    The items don’t have to be the same length — each string can be as

    long or as short as we want.

    We don’t need enough uninterrupted free memory to store all our

    strings next to each other — we can place each of them separately, wherever there’s space in RAM.
    We fixed it! No more tradeoffs. Right?
    Nope. Now we have a new tradeoff:
    Remember how the memory controller sends the contents of nearby memory addresses to the processor with each read? And the processor caches them? So reading sequential addresses in RAM is faster because we can get most of those reads right from the cache?



    Our original array was very cache-friendly, because everything was sequential. So reading from the 0th index, then the 1st index, then the 2nd, etc. got an extra speedup from the processor cache.
    But the pointers in this array make it not cache-friendly, because the baby names are scattered randomly around RAM. So reading from the 0th index, then the 1st index, etc. doesn’t get that extra speedup from the cache.
    That’s the tradeoff. This pointer-based array requires less uninterrupted memory and can accommodate elements that aren’t all the same size, but it’s slower because it’s not cache-friendly.
    This slowdown isn’t reflected in the big O time cost. Lookups in this pointer-based array are still time.

    Linked lists
    Our word processor is definitely going to need fast appends — appending to the document is like the main thing you do with a word processor.
    Can we build a data structure that can store a string, has fast appends, and doesn’t require you to say how long the string will be ahead of time?
    Let’s focus first on not having to know the length of our string ahead of time. Remember how we used pointers to get around length issues with our array of baby names?
    What if we pushed that idea even further?
    What if each character in our string were a two-index array with:

    the character itself 2. a pointer to the next character




    We would call each of these two-item arrays a node and we’d call this series of nodes a linked list.
    Here’s how we’d actually implement it in memory:



    Notice how we’re free to store our nodes wherever we can find two open slots in memory. They don’t have to be next to each other. They don’t even have to be in order:



    “But that’s not cache-friendly, “ you may be thinking. Good point! We’ll get to that.
    The first node of a linked list is called the head, and the last node is usually called the tail.
    Confusingly, some people prefer to use “tail” to refer to everything after the head of a linked list. In an interview it’s fine to use either definition. Briefly say which definition you’re using, just to be clear.
    It’s important to have a pointer variable referencing the head of the list — otherwise we’d be unable to find our way back to the start of the list!
    We’ll also sometimes keep a pointer to the tail. That comes in handy when we want to add something new to the end of the linked list. In fact, let’s try that out:
    Suppose we had the string “LOG” stored in a linked list:



    Suppose we wanted to add an “S” to the end, to make it “LOGS”. How would we do that?
    Easy. We just put it in a new node:



    And tweak some pointers:
    ​1. Grab the last letter, which is “G”. Our tail pointer lets us do this in time.



    ​2. Point the last letter’s next to the letter we’re appending (“S”).



    ​3. Update the tail pointer to point to our new last letter, “S”.



    That’s time.
    Why is it time? Because the runtime doesn’t get bigger if the string gets bigger. No matter how many characters are in our string, we still just have to tweak a couple pointers for any append.
    Now, what if instead of a linked list, our string had been a dynamic array? We might not have any room at the end, forcing us to do one of those doubling operations to make space:



    So with a dynamic array, our append would have a worst-case time cost of .
    Linked lists have worst-case -time appends, which is better than the worst-case time of dynamic arrays.
    That worst-case part is important. The average case runtime for appends to linked lists and dynamic arrays is the same: .
    Now, what if we wanted to *pre*pend something to our string? Let’s say we wanted to put a “B” at the beginning.
    For our linked list, it’s just as easy as appending. Create the node:



    And tweak some pointers:

    Point “B”’s next to “L”. 2. Point the head to “B”.




    Bam. time again.
    But if our string were a dynamic array…



    And we wanted to add in that “B”:



    Eep. We have to make room for the “B”!
    We have to move each character one space down:












    Now we can drop the “B” in there:



    What’s our time cost here?
    It’s all in the step where we made room for the first letter. We had to move all n characters in our string. One at a time. That’s time.
    So linked lists have faster *pre*pends ( time) than dynamic arrays ( time).
    No “worst case” caveat this time — prepends for dynamic arrays are always time. And prepends for linked lists are always time.
    These quick appends and prepends for linked lists come from the fact that linked list nodes can go anywhere in memory. They don’t have to sit right next to each other the way items in an array do.
    So if linked lists are so great, why do we usually store strings in an array? Because arrays have -time lookups. And those constant-time lookups come from the fact that all the array elements are lined up next to each other in memory.
    Lookups with a linked list are more of a process, because we have no way of knowing where the ith node is in memory. So we have to walk through the linked list node by node, counting as we go, until we hit the ith item.
    def get_ith_item_in_linked_list(head, i): if i < 0: raise ValueError(“i can’t be negative: %d” % i) current_node = head current_position = 0 while current_node: if current_position == i: # Found it! return current_node # Move on to the next node current_node = current_node.next current_position += 1 raise ValueError(‘List has fewer than i + 1 (%d) nodes’ % (i + 1))
    That’s i + 1 steps down our linked list to get to the ith node (we made our function zero-based to match indices in arrays). So linked lists have -time lookups. Much slower than the -time lookups for arrays and dynamic arrays.
    Not only that — walking down a linked list is not cache-friendly. Because the next node could be anywhere in memory, we don’t get any benefit from the processor cache. This means lookups in a linked list are even slower.
    So the tradeoff with linked lists is they have faster prepends and faster appends than dynamic arrays, but they have slower lookups.

    ## Doubly Linked Lists
    In a basic linked list, each item stores a single pointer to the next element.
    In a doubly linked list, items have pointers to the next and the previous nodes.



    Doubly linked lists allow us to traverse our list backwards. In a singly linked list, if you just had a pointer to a node in the middle of a list, there would be no way to know what nodes came before it. Not a problem in a doubly linked list.
    Not cache-friendly
    Most computers have caching systems that make reading from sequential addresses in memory faster than reading from scattered addresses.
    Array items are always located right next to each other in computer memory, but linked list nodes can be scattered all over.
    So iterating through a linked list is usually quite a bit slower than iterating through the items in an array, even though they’re both theoretically time.

    Hash tables
    Quick lookups are often really important. For that reason, we tend to use arrays (-time lookups) much more often than linked lists (-time lookups).
    For example, suppose we wanted to count how many times each ASCII character appears in Romeo and Juliet. How would we store those counts?
    We can use arrays in a clever way here. Remember — characters are just numbers. In ASCII (a common character encoding) ‘A’ is 65, ‘B’ is 66, etc.
    So we can use the character(‘s number value) as the index in our array, and store the count for that character at that index in the array:



    With this array, we can look up (and edit) the count for any character in constant time. Because we can access any index in our array in constant time.
    Something interesting is happening here — this array isn’t just a list of values. This array is storing two things: characters and counts. The characters are implied by the indices.
    So we can think of an array as a table with two columns…except you don’t really get to pick the values in one column (the indices) — they’re always 0, 1, 2, 3, etc.
    But what if we wanted to put any value in that column and still get quick lookups?
    Suppose we wanted to count the number of times each word appears in Romeo and Juliet. Can we adapt our array?
    Translating a character into an array index was easy. But we’ll have to do something more clever to translate a word (a string) into an array index…



    Here’s one way we could do it:
    Grab the number value for each character and add those up.



    The result is 429. But what if we only have 30 slots in our array? We’ll use a common trick for forcing a number into a specific range: the modulus operator (%). Modding our sum by 30 ensures we get a whole number that’s less than 30 (and at least 0):
    429 \: \% \: 30 = 9
    Bam. That’ll get us from a word (or any string) to an array index.
    This data structure is called a hash table or hash map. In our hash table, the counts are the values and the words (“lies, “ etc.) are the keys (analogous to the indices in an array). The process we used to translate a key into an array index is called a hashing function.
    ![A blank array except for a 20, labeled as the value, stored at index

    To the left the array is the word “lies,” labeled as the key, with an

    arrow pointing to the right at diamond with a question mark in the middle, labeled as the hashing function. The diamond points to the 9th index of the array.](https://www.interviewcake.com/images/svgs/cs_for_hackers__hash_tables_lies_key_labeled.svg?bust=209)
    The hashing functions used in modern systems get pretty complicated — the one we used here is a simplified example.
    Note that our quick lookups are only in one direction — we can quickly get the value for a given key, but the only way to get the key for a given value is to walk through all the values and keys.
    Same thing with arrays — we can quickly look up the value at a given index, but the only way to figure out the index for a given value is to walk through the whole array.
    One problem — what if two keys hash to the same index in our array? Look at “lies” and “foes”:



    They both sum up to 429! So of course they’ll have the same answer when we mod by 30:
    429 \: \% \: 30 = 9
    So our hashing function gives us the same answer for “lies” and “foes.” This is called a hash collision. There are a few different strategies for dealing with them.
    Here’s a common one: instead of storing the actual values in our array, let’s have each array slot hold a pointer to a linked list holding the counts for all the words that hash to that index:



    One problem — how do we know which count is for “lies” and which is for “foes”? To fix this, we’ll store the word as well as the count in each linked list node:



    “But wait!” you may be thinking, “Now lookups in our hash table take time in the worst case, since we have to walk down a linked list.” That’s true! You could even say that in the worst case every key creates a hash collision, so our whole hash table degrades to a linked list.
    In industry though, we usually wave our hands and say collisions are rare enough that on average lookups in a hash table are time. And there are fancy algorithms that keep the number of collisions low and keep the lengths of our linked lists nice and short.
    But that’s sort of the tradeoff with hash tables. You get fast lookups by key…except some lookups could be slow. And of course, you only get those fast lookups in one direction — looking up the key for a given value still takes time
    Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Breadth-First Traversal
    Breadth-first search (BFS) is a method for exploring a tree or graph. In a BFS, you first explore all the nodes one step away, then all the nodes two steps away, etc.
    Breadth-first search is like throwing a stone in the center of a pond. The nodes you explore “ripple out” from the starting point.
    Here’s a how a BFS would traverse this tree, starting with the root:



    We’d visit all the immediate children (all the nodes that’re one step away from our starting node):



    Then we’d move on to all those nodes’ children (all the nodes that’re two steps away from our starting node):



    And so on:



    Until we reach the end.
    Breadth-first search is often compared with depth-first search.
    Advantages:

    A BFS will find the shortest path between the starting point and

    any other reachable node. A depth-first search will not necessarily find the shortest path.
    Disadvantages

    A BFS on a binary tree generally requires more memory than a DFS.




    Binary Search Tree
    A binary tree is a tree where <==(every node has two or fewer children)==>.

    The children are usually called left and right.
    class BinaryTreeNode(object):
    This lets us build a structure like this:



    That particular example is special because every level of the tree is completely full. There are no “gaps.” We call this kind of tree “perfect.”
    Binary trees have a few interesting properties when they’re perfect:
    Property 1: the number of total nodes on each “level” doubles as we move down the tree.



    Property 2: the number of nodes on the last level is equal to the sum of the number of nodes on all other levels (plus 1). In other words, about half of our nodes are on the last level.
    <==(*Let’s call the number of nodes n, *)==>
    <==(_and the height of the tree h. _)==>
    h can also be thought of as the “number of levels.”
    If we had h, how could we calculate n?
    Let’s just add up the number of nodes on each level!
    If we zero-index the levels, the number of nodes on the xth level is exactly 2^x.

    Level 0: 2⁰ nodes,
    2. Level 1: 2¹ nodes,
    3. Level 2: 2² nodes,
    4. Level 3: 2³ nodes,
    5. etc

    So our total number of nodes is:
    n = 2⁰ + 2¹ + 2² + 2³ + … + 2^{h-1}
    Why only up to 2^{h-1}?
    Notice that we started counting our levels at 0.

    So if we have h levels in total,
    the last level is actually the “h-1”-th level.
    That means the number of nodes on the last level is 2^{h-1}.

    But we can simplify.
    Property 2 tells us that the number of nodes on the last level is (1 more than) half of the total number of nodes,
    so we can just take the number of nodes on the last level, multiply it by 2, and subtract 1 to get the number of nodes overall.

    We know the number of nodes on the last level is 2^{h-1},
    So:

    n = 2^{h-1} * 2–1

    n = 2^{h-1} * 2¹ — 1

    n = 2^{h-1+1}- 1

    n = 2^{h} — 1
    So that’s how we can go from h to n. What about the other direction?
    We need to bring the h down from the exponent.
    That’s what logs are for!
    First, some quick review.
    <==(log_{10} (100) )==>
    simply means,
    “What power must you raise 10 to in order to get 100?”.
    Which is 2,
    because .
    <==(10² = 100 )==>
    Graph Data Structure: Directed, Acyclic, etc
    Graph =====
    Binary numbers
    Let’s put those bits to use. Let’s store some stuff. Starting with numbers.
    The number system we usually use (the one you probably learned in elementary school) is called base 10, because each digit has ten possible values (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 0).
    But computers don’t have digits with ten possible values. They have bits with two possible values. So they use base 2 numbers.
    Base 10 is also called decimal. Base 2 is also called binary.
    To understand binary, let’s take a closer look at how decimal numbers work. Take the number “101” in decimal:



    Notice we have two “1”s here, but they don’t mean the same thing. The leftmost “1” means 100, and the rightmost “1” means 1. That’s because the leftmost “1” is in the hundreds place, while the rightmost “1” is in the ones place. And the “0” between them is in the tens place.



    So this “101” in base 10 is telling us we have “1 hundred, 0 tens, and 1 one.”



    Notice how the places in base 10 (ones place, tens place, hundreds place, etc.) are sequential powers of 10:

    10⁰=1 * 10¹=10 * 10²=100 * 10³=1000 * etc.

    The places in binary (base 2) are sequential powers of 2:

    2⁰=1 * 2¹=2 * 2²=4 * 2³=8 * etc.

    So let’s take that same “101” but this time let’s read it as a binary number:



    Reading this from right to left: we have a 1 in the ones place, a 0 in the twos place, and a 1 in the fours place. So our total is 4 + 0 + 1 which is 5.

    The idea behind big O notation

    Data Structures In Python
    The idea behind big O notation
    Big O notation is the language we use for talking about how long an algorithm takes to run. It’s how we compare the efficiency of different approaches to a problem.
    With big O notation we express the runtime in terms of
    how quickly it grows relative to the input, as the input gets arbitrarily large_.

    how quickly the runtime grows — It’s hard to pin down the exact runtime of an algorithm.


    It depends on the speed of the processor,
    what else the computer is running, etc.

    So instead of talking about the runtime directly, we use big O notation to talk about how quickly the runtime grows.

    relative to the input — If we were measuring our runtime directly,

    we could express our speed in seconds. Since we’re measuring how quickly our runtime grows, we need to express our speed in terms of…something else. With Big O notation, we use the size of the input, which we call “n.” So we can say things like the runtime grows “on the order of the size of the input” () or “on the order of the square of the size of the input” (). 3. as the input gets arbitrarily large — 
    Our algorithm may have steps that seem expensive when n is small but are eclipsed eventually by other steps as n gets huge. For big O analysis, we care most about the stuff that grows fastest as the input grows, because everything else is quickly eclipsed as n gets very large. (If you know what an asymptote is, you might see why “big O analysis” is sometimes called “asymptotic analysis.”)hy “big O analysis” is sometimes called “asymptotic analysis.”)

    Data Structures Reference
    Array
    Stores things in order. Has quick lookups by index.
    Linked List
    Also stores things in order. Faster insertions and deletions than arrays, but slower lookups (you have to “walk down” the whole list).
    Queue
    Like the line outside a busy restaurant. “First come, first served.”
    Stack
    Like a stack of dirty plates in the sink. The first one you take off the top is the last one you put down.
    Tree
    Good for storing hierarchies. Each node can have “child” nodes.
    Binary Search Tree
    Everything in the left subtree is smaller than the current node, everything in the right subtree is larger. lookups, but only if the tree is balanced!
    Binary Search Tree
    Graph
    Good for storing networks, geography, social relationships, etc.
    Heap
    A binary tree where the smallest value is always at the top. Use it to implement a priority queue.
    [A binary heap is a binary tree where the nodes are organized to so that the smallest value is always at the top.]
    Adjacency list
    A list where the index represents the node and the value at that index is a list of the node’s neighbors:
    graph = [ [1], [0, 2, 3], [1, 3], [1, 2], ]
    Since node 3 has edges to nodes 1 and 2, graph[3] has the adjacency list [1, 2].
    We could also use a dictionary where the keys represent the node and the values are the lists of neighbors.
    graph = { 0: [1], 1: [0, 2, 3], 2: [1, 3], 3: [1, 2], }
    This would be useful if the nodes were represented by strings, objects, or otherwise didn’t map cleanly to list indices.
    Adjacency matrix
    A matrix of 0s and 1s indicating whether node x connects to node y (0 means no, 1 means yes).
    graph = [ [0, 1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1], [0, 1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 1, 0], ]
    Since node 3 has edges to nodes 1 and 2, graph[3][1] and graph[3][2] have value 1.
    a = LinkedListNode(5) b = LinkedListNode(1) c = LinkedListNode(9) a.next = b b.next = c

    Arrays
    Ok, so we know how to store individual numbers. Let’s talk about storing several numbers.
    That’s right, things are starting to heat up.
    Suppose we wanted to keep a count of how many bottles of kombucha we drink every day.
    Let’s store each day’s kombucha count in an 8-bit, fixed-width, unsigned integer. That should be plenty — we’re not likely to get through more than 256 (2⁸) bottles in a single day, right?
    And let’s store the kombucha counts right next to each other in RAM, starting at memory address 0:
    Bam. That’s an array. RAM is basically an array already.
    Just like with RAM, the elements of an array are numbered. We call that number the index of the array element (plural: indices). In this example, each array element’s index is the same as its address in RAM.
    But that’s not usually true. Suppose another program like Spotify had already stored some information at memory address 2:
    We’d have to start our array below it, for example at memory address 3. So index 0 in our array would be at memory address 3, and index 1 would be at memory address 4, etc.:
    Suppose we wanted to get the kombucha count at index 4 in our array. How do we figure out what address in memory to go to? Simple math:
    Take the array’s starting address (3), add the index we’re looking for (4), and that’s the address of the item we’re looking for. 3 + 4 = 7. In general, for getting the nth item in our array:
    \text{address of nth item in array} = \text{address of array start} + n
    This works out nicely because the size of the addressed memory slots and the size of each kombucha count are both 1 byte. So a slot in our array corresponds to a slot in RAM.
    But that’s not always the case. In fact, it’s usually not the case. We usually use 64-bit integers.
    So how do we build an array of 64-bit (8 byte) integers on top of our 8-bit (1 byte) memory slots?
    We simply give each array index 8 address slots instead of 1:
    So we can still use simple math to grab the start of the nth item in our array — just gotta throw in some multiplication:
    \text{address of nth item in array} = \text{address of array start} + (n * \text{size of each item in bytes})
    Don’t worry — adding this multiplication doesn’t really slow us down. Remember: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of fixed-width integers takes time. So all the math we’re using here to get the address of the nth item in the array takes time.
    And remember how we said the memory controller has a direct connection to each slot in RAM? That means we can read the stuff at any given memory address in time.
    Together, this means looking up the contents of a given array index is time. This fast lookup capability is the most important property of arrays.
    But the formula we used to get the address of the nth item in our array only works if:

    Each item in the array is the same size (takes up the same

    number of bytes).

    The array is uninterrupted (contiguous) in memory. There can’t

    be any gaps in the array…like to “skip over” a memory slot Spotify was already using.
    These things make our formula for finding the nth item work because they make our array predictable. We can predict exactly where in memory the nth element of our array will be.
    But they also constrain what kinds of things we can put in an array. Every item has to be the same size. And if our array is going to store a lot of stuff, we’ll need a bunch of uninterrupted free space in RAM. Which gets hard when most of our RAM is already occupied by other programs (like Spotify).
    That’s the tradeoff. Arrays have fast lookups ( time), but each item in the array needs to be the same size, and you need a big block of uninterrupted free memory to store the array.

    Pointers
    Remember how we said every item in an array had to be the same size? Let’s dig into that a little more.
    Suppose we wanted to store a bunch of ideas for baby names. Because we’ve got some really cute ones.
    Each name is a string. Which is really an array. And now we want to store those arrays in an array. Whoa.
    Now, what if our baby names have different lengths? That’d violate our rule that all the items in an array need to be the same size!
    We could put our baby names in arbitrarily large arrays (say, 13 characters each), and just use a special character to mark the end of the string within each array…
    “Wigglesworth” is a cute baby name, right?
    But look at all that wasted space after “Bill”. And what if we wanted to store a string that was more than 13 characters? We’d be out of luck.
    There’s a better way. Instead of storing the strings right inside our array, let’s just put the strings wherever we can fit them in memory. Then we’ll have each element in our array hold the address in memory of its corresponding string. Each address is an integer, so really our outer array is just an array of integers. We can call each of these integers a pointer, since it points to another spot in memory.
    The pointers are marked with a * at the beginning.
    Pretty clever, right? This fixes both the disadvantages of arrays:

    The items don’t have to be the same length — each string can be as

    long or as short as we want.

    We don’t need enough uninterrupted free memory to store all our

    strings next to each other — we can place each of them separately, wherever there’s space in RAM.
    We fixed it! No more tradeoffs. Right?
    Nope. Now we have a new tradeoff:
    Remember how the memory controller sends the contents of nearby memory addresses to the processor with each read? And the processor caches them? So reading sequential addresses in RAM is faster because we can get most of those reads right from the cache?
    Our original array was very cache-friendly, because everything was sequential. So reading from the 0th index, then the 1st index, then the 2nd, etc. got an extra speedup from the processor cache.
    But the pointers in this array make it not cache-friendly, because the baby names are scattered randomly around RAM. So reading from the 0th index, then the 1st index, etc. doesn’t get that extra speedup from the cache.
    That’s the tradeoff. This pointer-based array requires less uninterrupted memory and can accommodate elements that aren’t all the same size, but it’s slower because it’s not cache-friendly.
    This slowdown isn’t reflected in the big O time cost. Lookups in this pointer-based array are still time.

    Linked lists
    Our word processor is definitely going to need fast appends — appending to the document is like the main thing you do with a word processor.
    Can we build a data structure that can store a string, has fast appends, and doesn’t require you to say how long the string will be ahead of time?
    Let’s focus first on not having to know the length of our string ahead of time. Remember how we used pointers to get around length issues with our array of baby names?
    What if we pushed that idea even further?
    What if each character in our string were a two-index array with:

    the character itself 
    a pointer to the next character




    We would call each of these two-item arrays a node and we’d call this series of nodes a linked list.
    Here’s how we’d actually implement it in memory:



    Notice how we’re free to store our nodes wherever we can find two open slots in memory. They don’t have to be next to each other. They don’t even have to be in order:
    “But that’s not cache-friendly,” you may be thinking. Good point! We’ll get to that.
    The first node of a linked list is called the head, and the last node is usually called the tail.
    Confusingly, some people prefer to use “tail” to refer to everything after the head of a linked list. In an interview it’s fine to use either definition. Briefly say which definition you’re using, just to be clear.
    It’s important to have a pointer variable referencing the head of the list — otherwise we’d be unable to find our way back to the start of the list!
    We’ll also sometimes keep a pointer to the tail. That comes in handy when we want to add something new to the end of the linked list. In fact, let’s try that out:
    Suppose we had the string “LOG” stored in a linked list:
    Suppose we wanted to add an “S” to the end, to make it “LOGS”. How would we do that?
    Easy. We just put it in a new node:
    And tweak some pointers:
    ​1. Grab the last letter, which is “G”. Our tail pointer lets us do this in time.
    ​2. Point the last letter’s next to the letter we’re appending (“S”).
    ​3. Update the tail pointer to point to our new last letter, “S”.
    That’s time.
    Why is it time? Because the runtime doesn’t get bigger if the string gets bigger. No matter how many characters are in our string, we still just have to tweak a couple pointers for any append.
    Now, what if instead of a linked list, our string had been a dynamic array? We might not have any room at the end, forcing us to do one of those doubling operations to make space:
    So with a dynamic array, our append would have a worst-case time cost of .
    Linked lists have worst-case -time appends, which is better than the worst-case time of dynamic arrays.
    That worst-case part is important. The average case runtime for appends to linked lists and dynamic arrays is the same: .
    Now, what if we wanted to prepend something to our string? Let’s say we wanted to put a “B” at the beginning.
    For our linked list, it’s just as easy as appending. Create the node:
    And tweak some pointers:

    Point “B”’s next to “L”. 2. Point the head to “B”.

    Bam. time again.
    But if our string were a dynamic array…
    And we wanted to add in that “B”:
    Eep. We have to make room for the “B”!
    We have to move each character one space down:
    Now we can drop the “B” in there:
    What’s our time cost here?
    It’s all in the step where we made room for the first letter. We had to move all n characters in our string. One at a time. That’s time.
    So linked lists have faster prepends ( time) than dynamic arrays ( time).
    No “worst case” caveat this time — prepends for dynamic arrays are always time. And prepends for linked lists are always time.
    These quick appends and prepends for linked lists come from the fact that linked list nodes can go anywhere in memory. They don’t have to sit right next to each other the way items in an array do.
    So if linked lists are so great, why do we usually store strings in an array? Because arrays have -time lookups. And those constant-time lookups come from the fact that all the array elements are lined up next to each other in memory.
    Lookups with a linked list are more of a process, because we have no way of knowing where the ith node is in memory. So we have to walk through the linked list node by node, counting as we go, until we hit the ith item.
    def get_ith_item_in_linked_list(head, i): if i < 0: raise ValueError(“i can’t be negative: %d” % i) current_node = head current_position = 0 while current_node: if current_position == i: # Found it! return current_node # Move on to the next node current_node = current_node.next current_position += 1 raise ValueError(‘List has fewer than i + 1 (%d) nodes’ % (i + 1))
    That’s i + 1 steps down our linked list to get to the ith node (we made our function zero-based to match indices in arrays). So linked lists have -time lookups. Much slower than the -time lookups for arrays and dynamic arrays.
    Not only that — walking down a linked list is not cache-friendly. Because the next node could be anywhere in memory, we don’t get any benefit from the processor cache. This means lookups in a linked list are even slower.
    So the tradeoff with linked lists is they have faster prepends and faster appends than dynamic arrays, but they have slower lookups.


     Doubly Linked Lists



    In a basic linked list, each item stores a single pointer to the next element.
    In a doubly linked list, items have pointers to the next and the previous nodes.
    Doubly linked lists allow us to traverse our list backwards. In a singly linked list, if you just had a pointer to a node in the middle of a list, there would be no way to know what nodes came before it. Not a problem in a doubly linked list.
    Not cache-friendly
    Most computers have caching systems that make reading from sequential addresses in memory faster than reading from scattered addresses.
    Array items are always located right next to each other in computer memory, but linked list nodes can be scattered all over.
    So iterating through a linked list is usually quite a bit slower than iterating through the items in an array, even though they’re both theoretically time.

    Hash tables
    Quick lookups are often really important. For that reason, we tend to use arrays (-time lookups) much more often than linked lists (-time lookups).
    For example, suppose we wanted to count how many times each ASCII character appears in Romeo and Juliet. How would we store those counts?
    We can use arrays in a clever way here. Remember — characters are just numbers. In ASCII (a common character encoding) ‘A’ is 65, ‘B’ is 66, etc.
    So we can use the character(‘s number value) as the index in our array, and store the count for that character at that index in the array:



    With this array, we can look up (and edit) the count for any character in constant time. Because we can access any index in our array in constant time.
    Something interesting is happening here — this array isn’t just a list of values. This array is storing two things: characters and counts. The characters are implied by the indices.
    So we can think of an array as a table with two columns…except you don’t really get to pick the values in one column (the indices) — they’re always 0, 1, 2, 3, etc.
    But what if we wanted to put any value in that column and still get quick lookups?
    Suppose we wanted to count the number of times each word appears in Romeo and Juliet. Can we adapt our array?
    Translating a character into an array index was easy. But we’ll have to do something more clever to translate a word (a string) into an array index…



    Here’s one way we could do it:
    Grab the number value for each character and add those up.



    The result is 429. But what if we only have 30 slots in our array? We’ll use a common trick for forcing a number into a specific range: the modulus operator (%). Modding our sum by 30 ensures we get a whole number that’s less than 30 (and at least 0):
    429 \: \% \: 30 = 9
    Bam. That’ll get us from a word (or any string) to an array index.
    This data structure is called a hash table or hash map. In our hash table, the counts are the values and the words (“lies,” etc.) are the keys (analogous to the indices in an array). The process we used to translate a key into an array index is called a hashing function.
    ![A blank array except for a 20, labeled as the value, stored at index

    To the left the array is the word “lies,” labeled as the key, with an

    arrow pointing to the right at diamond with a question mark in the middle, labeled as the hashing function. The diamond points to the 9th index of the array.](https://www.interviewcake.com/images/svgs/cs_for_hackers__hash_tables_lies_key_labeled.svg?bust=209)
    The hashing functions used in modern systems get pretty complicated — the one we used here is a simplified example.
    Note that our quick lookups are only in one direction — we can quickly get the value for a given key, but the only way to get the key for a given value is to walk through all the values and keys.
    Same thing with arrays — we can quickly look up the value at a given index, but the only way to figure out the index for a given value is to walk through the whole array.
    One problem — what if two keys hash to the same index in our array? Look at “lies” and “foes”:



    They both sum up to 429! So of course they’ll have the same answer when we mod by 30:
    429 \: \% \: 30 = 9
    So our hashing function gives us the same answer for “lies” and “foes.” This is called a hash collision. There are a few different strategies for dealing with them.
    Here’s a common one: instead of storing the actual values in our array, let’s have each array slot hold a pointer to a linked list holding the counts for all the words that hash to that index:



    One problem — how do we know which count is for “lies” and which is for “foes”? To fix this, we’ll store the word as well as the count in each linked list node:



    “But wait!” you may be thinking, “Now lookups in our hash table take time in the worst case, since we have to walk down a linked list.” That’s true! You could even say that in the worst case every key creates a hash collision, so our whole hash table degrades to a linked list.
    In industry though, we usually wave our hands and say collisions are rare enough that on average lookups in a hash table are time. And there are fancy algorithms that keep the number of collisions low and keep the lengths of our linked lists nice and short.
    But that’s sort of the tradeoff with hash tables. You get fast lookups by key…except some lookups could be slow. And of course, you only get those fast lookups in one direction — looking up the key for a given value still takes time. 
    Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Breadth-First Traversal
    Breadth-first search (BFS) is a method for exploring a tree or graph. In a BFS, you first explore all the nodes one step away, then all the nodes two steps away, etc.
    Breadth-first search is like throwing a stone in the center of a pond. The nodes you explore “ripple out” from the starting point.
    Here’s a how a BFS would traverse this tree, starting with the root:



    We’d visit all the immediate children (all the nodes that’re one step away from our starting node):
    Then we’d move on to all those nodes’ children (all the nodes that’re two steps away from our starting node):
    And so on:



    Until we reach the end.
    Breadth-first search is often compared with depth-first search.
    Advantages:

    A BFS will find the shortest path between the starting point and

    any other reachable node. A depth-first search will not necessarily find the shortest path.
    Disadvantages

    A BFS on a binary tree generally requires more memory than a DFS.




    Binary Search Tree
    A binary tree is a tree where <==(every node has two or fewer children)==>. The children are usually called left and right.
    class BinaryTreeNode(object):
    This lets us build a structure like this:



    That particular example is special because every level of the tree is completely full. There are no “gaps.” We call this kind of tree “perfect.”
    Binary trees have a few interesting properties when they’re perfect:
    Property 1: the number of total nodes on each “level” doubles as we move down the tree.



    Property 2: the number of nodes on the last level is equal to the sum of the number of nodes on all other levels (plus 1). In other words, about half of our nodes are on the last level.
    <==(Let’s call the number of nodes n,)==>
    <==(and the height of the tree h. )==>
    h can also be thought of as the “number of levels.”
    If we had h, how could we calculate n?
    Let’s just add up the number of nodes on each level!
    If we zero-index the levels, the number of nodes on the xth level is exactly 2^x.

    Level 0: 2⁰ nodes,
    Level 1: 2¹ nodes,
    Level 2: 2² nodes,
    Level 3: 2³ nodes,
    etc

    So our total number of nodes is:
    n = 2⁰ + 2¹ + 2² + 2³ + … + 2^{h-1}
    Why only up to 2^{h-1}?
    Notice that we started counting our levels at 0.

    So if we have h levels in total,
    the last level is actually the “h-1”-th level.
    That means the number of nodes on the last level is 2^{h-1}.

    But we can simplify.
    Property 2 tells us that the number of nodes on the last level is (1 more than) half of the total number of nodes,
    so we can just take the number of nodes on the last level, multiply it by 2, and subtract 1 to get the number of nodes overall.

    We know the number of nodes on the last level is 2^{h-1},

    So:
    n = 2^{h-1} * 2–1 n = 2^{h-1} * 2¹ — 1 n = 2^{h-1+1}- 1 n = 2^{h} — 1
    So that’s how we can go from h to n. What about the other direction?
    We need to bring the h down from the exponent.
    That’s what logs are for!
    First, some quick review.
    <==(log_{10} (100) )==>
    simply means,
    “What power must you raise 10 to in order to get 100?”.
    Which is 2,
    because .
    <==(10² = 100 )==>
    Graph Data Structure: Directed, Acyclic, etc
    Graph =====
    Binary numbers
    Let’s put those bits to use. Let’s store some stuff. Starting with numbers.
    The number system we usually use (the one you probably learned in elementary school) is called base 10, because each digit has ten possible values (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 0).
    But computers don’t have digits with ten possible values. They have bits with two possible values. So they use base 2 numbers.
    Base 10 is also called decimal. Base 2 is also called binary.




    10⁰=1 * 10¹=10 * 10²=100 * 10³=1000 * etc.

    The places in binary (base 2) are sequential powers of 2:

    2⁰=1 * 2¹=2 * 2²=4 * 2³=8 * etc.

    So let’s take that same “101” but this time let’s read it as a binary number:



    Reading this from right to left: we have a 1 in the ones place, a 0 in the twos place, and a 1 in the fours place. So our total is 4 + 0 + 1 which is 5.





    Variables and Expressions

    Duck-Typing : Programming Style which avoids checking an object’s type to figure out what it can do.



    Duck Typing is the fundamental approach of Python.



    Assignment of a value automatically declares.




    a = 7 b = 'Marbles' print(a) # => 7 print(b) # => Marbles

-   <span id="6c22">You can chain variable assignments to give multiple var names the same value.</span>
-   <span id="c495">Use with caution as this is highly unreadable</span>
-   <span id="d6cf">

<!-- -->

    count = max = min = 0 print(count) # => 0 print(max) # => 0 print(min) # => 0

-   <span id="f21e">The value and type of a variable can be re-assigned at any time.</span>

<!-- -->

    a = 17 print(a) # => 17 a = 'seventeen' print(a) # => seventeen

-   <span id="599c">`NaN` does not exist in Python, but you can ‘create’ it like so: `print(float("nan"))`</span>

### Boolean Data Type

-   <span id="0a6e">One of the biggest benefits of Python is that it reads more like English than JS does.</span>

Deploy React App To Heroku Using Postgres & Express
===================================================

Heroku is an web application that makes deploying applications easy for a beginner.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Deploy React App To Heroku Using Postgres & Express

Heroku is an web application that makes deploying applications easy for a beginner.

Before you begin deploying, make sure to remove any `console.log`’s or `debugger`’s in any production code. You can search your entire project folder if you are using them anywhere.

You will set up Heroku to run on a production, not development, version of your application. When a Node.js application like yours is pushed up to Heroku, it is identified as a Node.js application because of the `package.json` file. It runs `npm install` automatically. Then, if there is a `heroku-postbuild` script in the `package.json` file, it will run that script. Afterwards, it will automatically run `npm start`.

In the following phases, you will configure your application to work in production, not just in development, and configure the `package.json` scripts for `install`, `heroku-postbuild` and `start` scripts to install, build your React application, and start the Express production server.

### Phase 1: Heroku Connection

If you haven’t created a Heroku account yet, create one <a href="https://signup.heroku.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">here</a>.

Add a new application in your <a href="https://dashboard.heroku.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">Heroku dashboard</a> named whatever you want. Under the “Resources” tab in your new application, click “Find more add-ons” and add the “Heroku Postgres” add-on with the free Hobby Dev setting.

In your terminal, install the <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-command-line" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">Heroku CLI</a>. Afterwards, login to Heroku in your terminal by running the following:

    heroku login

Add Heroku as a remote to your project’s git repository in the following command and replace `<name-of-Heroku-app>` with the name of the application you created in the <a href="https://dashboard.heroku.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">Heroku dashboard</a>.

    heroku git:remote -a <name-of-Heroku-app>

Next, you will set up your Express + React application to be deployable to Heroku.

### Phase 2: Setting up your Express + React application

Right now, your React application is on a different localhost port than your Express application. However, since your React application only consists of static files that don’t need to bundled continuously with changes in production, your Express application can serve the React assets in production too. These static files live in the `frontend/build` folder after running `npm run build` in the `frontend` folder.

Add the following changes into your `backend/routes.index.js` file.

At the root route, serve the React application’s static `index.html` file along with `XSRF-TOKEN` cookie. Then serve up all the React application’s static files using the `express.static` middleware. Serve the `index.html` and set the `XSRF-TOKEN` cookie again on all routes that don’t start in `/api`. You should already have this set up in `backend/routes/index.js` which should now look like this:

    // backend/routes/index.js
    const express = require('express');
    const router = express.Router();
    const apiRouter = require('./api');
    router.use('/api', apiRouter);
    // Static routes
    // Serve React build files in production
    if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
    const path = require('path');
    // Serve the frontend's index.html file at the root route
    router.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.cookie('XSRF-TOKEN', req.csrfToken());
    res.sendFile(
    path.resolve(__dirname, '../../frontend', 'build', 'index.html')
    );
    });
    // Serve the static assets in the frontend's build folder
    router.use(express.static(path.resolve("../frontend/build")));
    // Serve the frontend's index.html file at all other routes NOT starting with /api
    router.get(/^(?!/?api).*/, (req, res) => {
    res.cookie('XSRF-TOKEN', req.csrfToken());
    res.sendFile(
    path.resolve(__dirname, '../../frontend', 'build', 'index.html')
    );
    });
    }
    // Add a XSRF-TOKEN cookie in development
    if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {
    router.get('/api/csrf/restore', (req, res) => {
    res.cookie('XSRF-TOKEN', req.csrfToken());
    res.status(201).json({});
    });
    }
    module.exports = router;
    Your Express backend’s package.json should include scripts to run the sequelize CLI commands.
    The backend/package.json’s scripts should now look like this:
    "scripts": {
        "sequelize": "sequelize",
        "sequelize-cli": "sequelize-cli",
        "start": "per-env",
        "start:development": "nodemon -r dotenv/config ./bin/www",
        "start:production": "node ./bin/www"
      },

Initialize a `package.json` file at the very root of your project directory (outside of both the `backend` and `frontend` folders). The scripts defined in this `package.json` file will be run by Heroku, not the scripts defined in the `backend/package.json` or the `frontend/package.json`.

When Heroku runs `npm install`, it should install packages for both the `backend` and the `frontend`. Overwrite the `install` script in the root `package.json` with:

    npm --prefix backend install backend && npm --prefix frontend install frontend

This will run `npm install` in the `backend` folder then run `npm install` in the `frontend` folder.

Next, define a `heroku-postbuild` script that will run the `npm run build` command in the `frontend` folder. Remember, Heroku will automatically run this script after running `npm         install`.

Define a `sequelize` script that will run `npm run sequelize` in the `backend` folder.

Finally, define a `start` that will run `npm start` in the \`backend folder.

The root `package.json`’s scripts should look like this:

    "scripts": {
        "heroku-postbuild": "npm run build --prefix frontend",
        "install": "npm --prefix backend install backend && npm --prefix frontend install frontend",
        "dev:backend": "npm install --prefix backend start",
        "dev:frontend": "npm install --prefix frontend start",
        "sequelize": "npm run --prefix backend sequelize",
        "sequelize-cli": "npm run --prefix backend sequelize-cli",
        "start": "npm start --prefix backend"
      },

The `dev:backend` and `dev:frontend` scripts are optional and will not be used for Heroku.

Finally, commit your changes.

### Phase 3: Deploy to Heroku

Once you’re finished setting this up, navigate to your application’s Heroku dashboard. Under “Settings” there is a section for “Config Vars”. Click the `Reveal Config         Vars` button to see all your production environment variables. You should have a `DATABASE_URL` environment variable already from the Heroku Postgres add-on.

Add environment variables for `JWT_EXPIRES_IN` and `JWT_SECRET` and any other environment variables you need for production.

You can also set environment variables through the Heroku CLI you installed earlier in your terminal. See the docs for <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/config-vars" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">Setting Heroku Config Variables</a>.

Push your project to Heroku. Heroku only allows the `master` branch to be pushed. But, you can alias your branch to be named `master` when pushing to Heroku. For example, to push a branch called `login-branch` to `master` run:

    git push heroku login-branch:master

If you do want to push the `master` branch, just run:

    git push heroku master

You may want to make two applications on Heroku, the `master` branch site that should have working code only. And your `staging` site that you can use to test your work in progress code.

Now you need to migrate and seed your production database.

Using the Heroku CLI, you can run commands inside of your production application just like in development using the `heroku run` command.

For example to migrate the production database, run:

    heroku run npm run sequelize db:migrate

To seed the production database, run:

    heroku run npm run sequelize db:seed:all

Note: You can interact with your database this way as you’d like, but beware that `db:drop` cannot be run in the Heroku environment. If you want to drop and create the database, you need to remove and add back the “Heroku Postgres” add-on.

Another way to interact with the production application is by opening a bash shell through your terminal by running:

    heroku bash

In the opened shell, you can run things like `npm run sequelize db:migrate`.

Open your deployed site and check to see if you successfully deployed your Express + React application to Heroku!

If you see an `Application Error` or are experiencing different behavior than what you see in your local environment, check the logs by running:

    heroku logs

If you want to open a connection to the logs to continuously output to your terminal, then run:

    heroku logs --tail

The logs may clue you into why you are experiencing errors or different behavior.

-   <span id="856f">Tab Expand Way: Type your emmet code and press `Tab` key</span>
-   <span id="9aea">Interactive Method: Press `alt + ctrl + Enter` and start typing your expressions. This should automatically generate HTML snippets on the fly.</span>

**This cheatsheet will assume that you press** `Tab` **after each expressions.**

### HTML

### Generating HTML 5 DOCTYPE

`html:5`  
Will generate

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
      <meta charset="UTF-8">
      <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
      <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">
      <title>Document</title>
    </head>
    <body>
    </body>

    </html>
    Child items
    Child items are created using >
    ul>li>p
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p></p>
      </li>
    </ul>

### Sibling Items

Sibling items are created using `+`

`html>head+body`

    <html>
    <head></head>
    <body>
    </body>

    </html>
    Multiplication
    Items can be multiplied by *
    ul>li*5
    <ul>
      <li></li>
      <li></li>
      <li></li>
      <li></li>
      <li></li>
    </ul>

### Grouping

Items can be grouped together using `()`

`table>(tr>th*5)+tr>t*5`

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th></th>
        <th></th>
        <th></th>
        <th></th>
        <th></th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <t></t>
        <t></t>
        <t></t>
        <t></t>
        <t></t>
      </tr>
    </table>

### Class and ID

Class and Id in Emmet can be done using `.` and `#`

`div.heading`

    <div class="heading"></div>

`div#heading`

    <div id="heading"></div>

ID and Class can also be combined together

`div#heading.center`

    <div id="heading" class="center"></div>

### Adding Content inside tags

Contents inside tags can be added using `{}`

`h1{Emmet is awesome}+h2{Every front end developers should use this}+p{This is paragraph}*2`

    <h1>Emmet is awesome</h1>
    <h2>Every front end developers should use this</h2>
    <p>This is paragraph</p>
    <p>This is paragraph</p>

### Attributes inside HTML tags

Attributes can be added using `[]`

`a[href=https://?google.com data-toggle=something target=_blank]`

    <a href="https://?google.com" data-toggle="something" target="_blank"></a>

### Numbering

Numbering can be done using `$`  
You can use this inside tag or contents.

`h${This is so awesome $}*6`

    <h1>This is so awesome 1</h1>
    <h2>This is so awesome 2</h2>
    <h3>This is so awesome 3</h3>
    <h4>This is so awesome 4</h4>
    <h5>This is so awesome 5</h5>
    <h6>This is so awesome 6</h6>

Use `@-` to reverse the Numbering

`img[src=image$$@-.jpg]*5`

    <img src="image05.jpg" alt="">
    <img src="image04.jpg" alt="">
    <img src="image03.jpg" alt="">
    <img src="image02.jpg" alt="">
    <img src="image01.jpg" alt="">

To start the numbering from specific number, use this way

`img[src=emmet$@100.jpg]*5`

    <img src="emmet100.jpg" alt="">
    <img src="emmet101.jpg" alt="">
    <img src="emmet102.jpg" alt="">
    <img src="emmet103.jpg" alt="">
    <img src="emmet104.jpg" alt="">

### Tips

-   <span id="b708">Use `:` to expand known abbreviations</span>

`input:date`

    <input type="date" name="" id="">

`form:post`

    <form action="" method="post"></form>

`link:css`

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">

-   <span id="d43e">Building Navbar</span>

`.navbar>ul>li*3>a[href=#]{Item $@-}`

    <div class="navbar">
      <ul>
        <li><a href="#">Item 3</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">Item 2</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">Item 1</a></li>
      </ul>
    </div>

### CSS

Emmet works surprisingly well with css as well.

-   <span id="68eb">`f:l`</span>

<!-- -->

    float: left;

You can also use any options n/r/l

-   <span id="d9cc">`pos:a­`</span>

<!-- -->

    position: absolute;

Also use any options, pos:a/r/f

-   <span id="5b67">`d:n/b­/f/­i/ib`</span>

`d:ib`

    display: inline-block;

-   <span id="26f6">You can use `m` for margin and `p` for padding followed by direction</span>

`mr` -&gt; `margin-right`

`pr` -&gt; `padding-right`

-   <span id="01cc">`@f` will result in</span>

<!-- -->

    @font-face {
      font-family:;
      src:url();
    }

You can also use these shorthands

### Misconceptions about React

#### <a href="https://aglowiditsolutions.com/blog/react-vs-angular/" class="markup--anchor markup--h4-anchor">React is a framework</a>:

<a href="https://aglowiditsolutions.com/blog/react-vs-angular/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">Many developers an</a>d aspiring students misinterpret React to be a fully functional framework. It is because we often compare React with major frameworks such as Angular and Ember. This comparison is not to compare the best frameworks but to focus on the differences and similarities of React and Angular’s approach that makes their offerings worth studying. Angular works on **the MVC model** to support the Model, View, and Controller layers of an app. React focuses only on the ‘V,’ which is the **view layer** of an application and how to make handling it easier to integrate smoothly into a project.

#### React’s Virtual DOM is faster than DOM.

React uses a **Virtual DOM**, which is essentially a tree of JavaScript objects representing the actual browser DOM. The advantage of using this for the developers is that they don’t manipulate the DOM directly as developers do with jQuery when they write React apps. Instead, they would tell React how they want the DOM to make changes to the state object and allow React to make the necessary updates to the browser DOM. This helps create a comprehensive development model for developers as they don’t need to track all DOM changes. They can modify the state object, and React would use its algorithms to understand what part of UI changed compared to the previous DOM. Using this information updates the actual browser DOM. Virtual DOM provides an excellent API for creating UI and minimizes the update count to be made on the browser DOM.

However, it is **not faster** than the actual DOM. You just read that it needs to pull extra strings to figure out what part of UI needs to be updated before actually performing those updates. Hence, Virtual DOM is beneficial for many things, but it ***isn’t faster than DOM.***

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **1. Explain how React uses a tree data structure called the virtual DOM to model the DOM**

> The virtual DOM is a copy of the actual DOM tree. Updates in React are made to the virtual DOM. React uses a diffing algorithm to reconcile the changes and send the to the DOM to commit and paint.

### **2. Create virtual DOM nodes using JSX** To create a React virtual DOM node using JSX, define HTML syntax in a JavaScript file.

> Here, the JavaScript hello variable is set to a React virtual DOM h1 element with the text “Hello World!”.

> You can also nest virtual DOM nodes in each other just like how you do it in HTML with the real DOM.

### **3. Use debugging tools to determine when a component is rendering**

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*jf3yl4GKDHpxmPJk.gif" class="graf-image" /></figure><figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/0*hBOo6hfwhKwS5UDM.jpg" class="graf-image" /></figure>#### We use the React DevTools extension as an extension in our Browser DevTools to debug and view when a component is rendering

### **4. Describe how JSX transforms into actual DOM nodes**

-   <span id="358b">To transfer JSX into DOM nodes, we use the ReactDOM.render method. It takes a React virtual DOM node’s changes allows Babel to transpile it and sends the JS changes to commit to the DOM.</span>

### **5. Use the** `ReactDOM.render` **method to have React render your virtual DOM nodes under an actual DOM node**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **6. Attach an event listener to an actual DOM node using a virtual node**

The virtual DOM (VDOM) is a programming concept where an ideal, or “virtual”, representation of a UI is kept in memory and synced with the “real” DOM by a library such as ReactDOM. This process is called <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/reconciliation.html" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">reconciliation</a>.

This approach enables the declarative API of React: You tell React what state you want the UI to be in, and it makes sure the DOM matches that state. This abstracts out the attribute manipulation, event handling, and manual DOM updating that you would otherwise have to use to build your app.

Since “virtual DOM” is more of a pattern than a specific technology, people sometimes say it to mean different things. In React world, the term “virtual DOM” is usually associated with <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/rendering-elements.html" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">React elements</a> since they are the objects representing the user interface. React, however, also uses internal objects called “fibers” to hold additional information about the component tree. They may also be considered a part of “virtual DOM” implementation in React.

### Is the Shadow DOM the same as the Virtual DOM?

No, they are different. The Shadow DOM is a browser technology designed primarily for scoping variables and CSS in web components. The virtual DOM is a concept implemented by libraries in JavaScript on top of browser APIs.

-   <span id="8534">To add an event listener to an element, define a method to handle the event and associate that method with the element event you want to listen for:</span>

### **7. Use** `create-react-app` **to initialize a new React app and import required dependencies**

-   <span id="6d60">Create the default create-react-application by typing in our terminal</span>

#### <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/npm-vs-npx-whats-the-difference/" class="markup--anchor markup--h4-anchor">Explanation of npm vs npx from Free Code Camp:</a>

**npm** (node package manager) is the dependency/package manager you get out of the box when you install Node.js. It provides a way for developers to install packages both globally and locally.

Sometimes you might want to take a look at a specific package and try out some commands. But you cannot do that without installing the dependencies in your local `node_modules` folder.

### npm the package manager

npm is a couple of things. First and foremost, it is an online repository for the publishing of open-source Node.js projects.

Second, it is a CLI tool that aids you to install those packages and manage their versions and dependencies. There are hundreds of thousands of Node.js libraries and applications on npm and many more are added every day.

npm by itself doesn’t run any packages. If you want to run a package using npm, you must specify that package in your `package.json` file.

When executables are installed via npm packages, npm creates links to them:

-   <span id="7798">**local** installs have links created at the `./node_modules/.bin/` directory</span>
-   <span id="a534">**global** installs have links created from the global `bin/` directory (for example: `/usr/local/bin` on Linux or at `%AppData%/npm` on Windows)</span>

To execute a package with npm you either have to type the local path, like this:

    $ ./node_modules/.bin/your-package

or you can run a locally installed package by adding it into your `package.json` file in the scripts section, like this:

    {
      "name": "your-application",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "scripts": {
        "your-package": "your-package"
      }
    }

Then you can run the script using `npm run`:

    npm run your-package

You can see that running a package with plain npm requires quite a bit of ceremony.

Fortunately, this is where **npx** comes in handy.

### npx the package runner

Since npm version <a href="https://github.com/npm/npm/releases/tag/v5.2.0" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">5.2.0</a> npx is pre-bundled with npm. So it’s pretty much a standard nowadays.

**npx** is also a CLI tool whose purpose is to make it easy to install and manage dependencies hosted in the npm registry.

It’s now very easy to run any sort of Node.js-based executable that you would normally install via npm.

You can run the following command to see if it is already installed for your current npm version:

    $ which npx

If it’s not, you can install it like this:

    $ npm install -g npx

Once you make sure you have it installed, let’s see a few of the use cases that make **npx** extremely helpful.

### Run a locally installed package easily

If you wish to execute a locally installed package, all you need to do is type:

    $ npx your-package

npx will check whether `<command>` or `<package>` exists in `$PATH`, or in the local project binaries, and if so it will execute it.

### Execute packages that are not previously installed

Another major advantage is the ability to execute a package that wasn’t previously installed.

Sometimes you just want to use some CLI tools but you don’t want to install them globally just to test them out. This means you can save some disk space and simply run them only when you need them. This also means your global variables will be less polluted.

> Now, where were we?

`npx create-react-app <name of app> --use-npm`

-   <span id="e1cb">npx gives us the latest version. `--use-npm` just means to use npm instead of yarn or some other package manager</span>

### **8. Pass props into a React component**

-   <span id="9111">`props` is an object that gets passed down from the parent component to the child component. The values can be of any data structure including a function (which is an object)</span>

<!-- -->

-   <span id="7a12">You can also <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals" class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor">interpolate values</a> into JSX.</span>
-   <span id="f405">Set a variable to the string, “world”, and replace the string of “world” in the NavLinks JSX element with the variable wrapped in curly braces:</span>

> **Accessing props:**

To access our props object in another component we pass it the props argument and React will invoke the functional component with the props object.

### Reminder:

Conceptually, components are like JavaScript functions. They accept arbitrary inputs (called “props”) and return React elements describing what should appear on the screen.

### Function and Class Components

The simplest way to define a component is to write a JavaScript function:

    function Welcome(props) {
      return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
    }

This function is a valid React component because it accepts a single “props” (which stands for properties) object argument with data and returns a React element. We call such components “function components” because they are literally JavaScript functions.

You can also use an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">ES6 class</a> to define a component:

    class Welcome extends React.Component {
      render() {
        return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;
      }
    }

The above two components are equivalent from React’s point of view.

-   <span id="99d5">You can pass down **as many props keys as you want**.</span>

### **9. Destructure props**

> You can destructure the props object in the function component’s parameter.

### **10. Create routes using components from the react-router-dom package**

1.  Import the react-router-dom package:

    npm i react-router-dom

> In your index.js:

1.  <span id="46f3">Above you import your BrowserRouter with which you can wrap your entire route hierarchy. This makes routing information from React Router available to all its descendent components.</span>
2.  <span id="f675">Then in the component of your choosing, usually top tier such as App.js, you can create your routes using the Route and Switch Components</span>

-   <span id="d8fd">In general, relational data is information that is connected to other pieces of information.</span>
-   <span id="2fa8">When working with relational databases, we can connect two entries together utilizing foreign keys (explained below).</span>
-   <span id="e199">In a pets database, we could be keeping track of dogs and cats as well as the toys that each of them own. That ownership of a cat to a toy is the relational aspect of relational data. Two pieces of information that can be connected together to show some sort of meaning.</span>

**Define what a database is**

-   <span id="06fe">The actual location that data is stored.</span>
-   <span id="78c5">A database can be made up of many tables that each store specific kinds of information.</span>
-   <span id="f752">We could have a pets database that stores information about many different types of animals. Each animal type could potentially be represented by a different table.</span>

**Define what a database table is**

-   <span id="04ae">Within a database, a table stores one specific kind of information.</span>
-   <span id="3878">The records (entries) on these tables can be connected to records on other tables through the use of foreign keys</span>
-   <span id="d6f9">In our pets database, we could have a dogs table, with individual records</span>

**Describe the purpose of a primary key**

-   <span id="4d0e">A primary key is used in the database as a unique identifier for the table.</span>
-   <span id="8fb0">We often use an id field that simply increments with each entry. The incrementing ensures that each record has a unique identifier, even if their are other fields of the record that are repeated (two people with the same name would still need to have a unique identifier, for example).</span>
-   <span id="8876">With a unique identifier, we can easily connect records within the table to records from other tables.</span>

**Describe the purpose of a foreign key**

-   <span id="cf54">A foreign key is used as the connector from this record to the primary key of another table s record.</span>
-   <span id="f397">In our pets example, we can imagine two tables to demonstrate: a table to represent cats and a table to represent toys. Each of these tables has a primary key of id that is used as the unique identifier. In order to make a connection between a toy and a cat, we can add another field to the cat table called owner\_id , indicating that it is a foreign key for the cat table. By setting a toy s owner\_id to the same value as a particular cat s id , we can indicate that the cat is the owner of that toy.</span>

**Describe how to properly name things in PostgreSQL**

-   <span id="d6e6">Names within postgres should generally consist of only lowercase letters, numbers, and underscores.</span>
-   <span id="0fb3">Tables within a database are plural by convention, so a table for cats would typically be cats and office locations would be office\_locations (all lowercase, underscores to replace spaces, plural)</span>

**Connect to an instance of PostgreSQL with the command line tool psql**

-   <span id="1b7f">The psql command by default will try to connect to a database and username that matches your system s username</span>
-   <span id="1454">We connect to a different database by providing an argument to the psql command</span>
-   <span id="3439">psql pets</span>
-   <span id="fb37">To connect with a different username we can use the -U flag followed by the username we would like to use. To connect to the pets database as pets\_user</span>
-   <span id="d357">psql -U pets\_user pets</span>
-   <span id="e139">If there is a password for the user, we can tell psql that we would like a prompt for the password to show up by using the -W flag.</span>
-   <span id="8709">psql -U pets\_user -W pets (the order of our flags doesn t matter, as long as any arguments associated with them are together, such as pets\_user directly following -U in this example)</span>

**Identify whether a user is a normal user or a superuser by the prompt in the psql shell**

-   <span id="8ff5">You can tell if you are logged in as a superuser or normal user by the prompt in the terminal.</span>
-   <span id="de97">If the prompt shows =&gt;, the user is a normal user</span>
-   <span id="7ce3">If the prompt show =\#, the user is a superuser</span>

**Create a user for the relational database management system**

-   <span id="f4dc">Within psql, we can create a user with the CREATE USER {username} {WITH options} command.</span>
-   <span id="7eda">The most common options we ll want to use are WITH PASSWORD ‘mypassword’ to provide a password for the user we are creating, CREATEDB to allow the user to create new databases, or SUPERUSER to create a user with all elevated permissions.</span>

**Create a database in the database management system**

-   <span id="3fff">We can use the command CREATE DATABASE {database name} {options} inside psql to create a new database.</span>
-   <span id="7d2f">A popular option we may utilize is WITH OWNER {owner name} to set another user as the owner of the database we are making.</span>

**Configure a database so that only the owner (and superusers) can connect to it**

-   <span id="1a73">We can GRANT and REVOKE privileges from a database to users or categories of users.</span>
-   <span id="8795">In order to remove connection privileges to a database from the public we can use REVOKE CONNECT ON DATABASE {db\_name} FROM PUBLIC;, removing all public connection access.</span>
-   <span id="ee98">If we wanted to grant it back, or to a specific user, we could similarly do GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE {db\_name} FROM {specific user, PUBLIC, etc.};</span>

**View a list of databases in an installation of PostgreSQL**

-   <span id="2111">To list all databases we can use the \\l or \\list command in psql.</span>

**Create tables in a database**

    CREATE TABLE {table name} (
    {columnA} {typeA},
    {columnB} {typeB},
    etc…
    );

-   <span id="a2fc">The whitespace does not matter. Creating the SQL statements on multiple lines is easier to read, but just like JavaScript, they can be presented differently.</span>
-   <span id="a203">One common issue is that SQL does not like trailing commas, so the last column cannot have a comma after its type in this example.</span>

**View a list of tables in a database**

-   <span id="964a">To list all database tables, use the \\dt command.</span>

**Identify and describe the common data types used in PostgreSQL**

-   <span id="a2fd">There are many different data types that we can use in our tables, here are some common examples:</span>
-   <span id="1d53">SERIAL: autoincrementing, very useful for IDs</span>
-   <span id="78ce">VARCHAR(n): a string with a character limit of n</span>
-   <span id="2e02">TEXT: doesn t have character limit, but less performant</span>
-   <span id="c20e">BOOLEAN: true/false</span>
-   <span id="d525">SMALLINT: signed two-byte integer (-32768 to 32767)</span>
-   <span id="6b96">INTEGER: signed four-byte integer (standard)</span>
-   <span id="fa38">BIGINT: signed eight-byte integer (very large numbers)</span>
-   <span id="aa0c">NUMERIC: or DECIMAL, can store exact decimal values</span>
-   <span id="1fb6">TIMESTAMP: date and time</span>

**Describe the purpose of the UNIQUE and NOT NULL constraints, and create columns in database tables that have them**

-   <span id="377b">In addition to the data type, we can provide flags for constraints to place on our column data.</span>
-   <span id="bda2">The UNIQUE flag indicates that the data for the column must not be repeated.</span>
-   <span id="e14c">By default we can create entries in our tables that are missing data from columns. When creating a pet, maybe we don t provide an age because we don t know it, for example. If we want to require that the data be present in order to create a new record, we can indicate that column must be NOT NULL.</span>
-   <span id="6745">In the example below, we are requiring our pets to have unique names and for them to be present (both UNIQUE and NOT NULL). We have no such constraints on the age column, allowing repetition of ages or their complete absence.</span>

<!-- -->

    CREATE TABLE pets (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    age SMALLINT
    );

**Create a primary key for a table**

-   <span id="da50">When creating a table we can indicate the primary key by passing in the column name to parentheses like so:</span>

<!-- -->

    CREATE TABLE people (
    id SERIAL,
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    last_name VARCHAR(50),
    PRIMARY KEY (id)
    );

-   <span id="4871">We could have also used the PRIMARY KEY flag on the column definition itself:</span>

<!-- -->

    CREATE TABLE people (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    last_name VARCHAR(50)
    );

**Create foreign key constraints to relate tables**

-   <span id="e576">In our table definition, we can use the line FOREIGN KEY (foreign\_key\_stored\_in\_this\_table) REFERENCE {other table} ({other\_tables\_key\_name}) to connect two tables.</span>
-   <span id="4c08">This is probably easier to see in an example:</span>

<!-- -->

    CREATE TABLE people (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    last_name VARCHAR(50)
    );

    CREATE TABLE pets (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    age SMALLINT,
    person_id INTEGER,
    FOREIGN KEY (person_id) REFERENCES people (id)
    );

**SQL is not case sensitive for its keywords but is for its entity names**

-   <span id="7749">Exactly as the LO states, CREATE TABLE and create table are interpreted the same way. Using capitalization is a good convention in order to distinguish your keywords.</span>
-   <span id="7d1b">The entity names that we use ARE case-sensitive, however. So a table named pets is unique from a table named Pets. In general, we prefer to use all lowercase for our entities to avoid any of this confusion.</span>

**SQL**

1.  How to use the SELECT … FROM … statement to select data from a single table

-   <span id="9202">Supply the column names in the SELECT clause. If we want all columns, we can also use \*</span>
-   <span id="9fdc">Supply the table names in the FROM clause</span>

— Selects all columns from the friends table

    SELECT
    *
    FROM
    friends;

— Selects the first\_name column from the friends table (remember whitespace is ignored)  
SELECT name  
FROM friends;

-   <span id="ef22">Sometimes we may need to specify what table we are selecting a column from, particulurly if we had joined multiple tables together.</span>

— Notice here we are indicating that we want the “name” field from the “friends” table as well as the “name” field from the “puppies” table. We indicate the table name by table.column  
 — We are also aliasing these fields with the AS keyword so that our returned results have friend\_name and puppy\_name as field headers

    SELECT
    friends.name AS friend_name , puppies.name AS puppy_name
    FROM
    friends
    JOIN
    puppies ON friends.puppy_id = puppies.id

**How to use the WHERE clause on SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements to narrow the scope of the command**

-   <span id="6a59">The WHERE clause allows us to select or apply actions to records that match specific criteria instead of to a whole table.</span>
-   <span id="7ec8">We can use WHERE with a couple of different operators when making our comparison</span>
-   <span id="70eb">WHERE {column} = {value} provides an exact comparison</span>
-   <span id="79bf">WHERE {column} IN ({value1}, {value2}, {value3}, etc.) matches any provided value in the IN statement. We can make this more complex by having a subquery inside of the parentheses, having our column match any values within the returned results.</span>
-   <span id="150e">WHERE {column} BETWEEN {value1} AND {value2} can check for matches between two values (numeric ranges)</span>
-   <span id="9077">WHERE {column} LIKE {pattern} can check for matches to a string. This is most useful when we use the wildcard %, such as WHERE breed LIKE ‘%Shepherd’, which will match any breed that ends in Shepherd</span>
-   <span id="4a87">The NOT operator can also be used for negation in the checks.</span>
-   <span id="db35">Mathematical operators can be used when performing calculations or comparisons within a query as well, such as</span>

<!-- -->

    SELECT name, breed, weight_lbs FROM puppies WHERE weight_lbs > 50; — OR SELECT name, breed, age_yrs FROM puppies WHERE age_yrs * 10 = 5;

**How to use the JOIN keyword to join two (or more) tables together into a single virtual table**

-   <span id="a391">When we want to get information from a related table or do querying based on related table values, we can join the connected table by comparing the foreign key to where it lines up on the other table:</span>

— Here we are joining the puppies table on to the friends table. We are specifying that the comparison we should make is the foreign key puppy\_id on the friends table should line up with the primary key id on the puppies table.

    SELECT
    *
    FROM
    friends
    JOIN
    puppies ON friends.puppy_id = puppies.id

**How to use the INSERT statement to insert data into a table**

-   <span id="b3e7">When a table is already created we can then insert records into it using the INSERT INTO keywords.</span>
-   <span id="d4d3">We provide the name of the table that we would like to add records to, followed by the VALUES keyword and each record we are adding. Here s an example:</span>

— We are providing the table name, then multiple records to insert  
 — The values are listed in the order that they are defined on the table

    INSERT INTO table_name
    VALUES
    (column1_value, colum2_value, column3_value),
    (column1_value, colum2_value, column3_value),
    (column1_value, colum2_value, column3_value);

-   <span id="123c">We can also specify columns when we are inserting data. This makes it clear which fields we are providing data for and allows us to provide them out of order, skip null or default values, etc.</span>

— In this example, we want to use the default value for id since it is autoincremented, so we provide DEFAULT for this field

    INSERT INTO friends (id, first_name, last_name)
    VALUES
    (DEFAULT, ‘Amy’, ‘Pond’);

— Alternatively, we can leave it out completely, since the default value will be used if none is provided

    INSERT INTO friends (first_name, last_name)
    VALUES
    (‘Rose’, ‘Tyler’),
    (‘Martha’, ‘Jones’),
    (‘Donna’, ‘Noble’),
    (‘River’, ‘Song’);

**How to use an UPDATE statement to update data in a table**

-   <span id="8e80">The UPDATE keyword can be used to find records and change their values in our database.</span>
-   <span id="91b5">We generally follow the pattern of UPDATE {table} SET {column} = {new value} WHERE {match condition};.</span>
-   <span id="5fff">Without a condition to narrow our records down, we will update every record in the table, so this is an important thing to double check!</span>
-   <span id="cdee">We can update multiple fields as well by specifying each column in parentheses and their associated new values: UPDATE {table} SET ({column1}, {column2}) = ({value1}, {value2}) WHERE {match condition};</span>

— Updates the pet with id of 4 to change their name and breed

    UPDATE
    pets
    SET
    (name, breed) = (‘Floofy’, ‘Fluffy Dog Breed’) WHERE id = 4;

**How to use a DELETE statement to remove data from a table**

-   <span id="1c5e">Similar to selecting records, we can delete records from a table by specifying what table we are deleting from and what criteria we would like to match in order to delete.</span>
-   <span id="1b25">We follow the general structure DELETE FROM {table} WHERE {condition};</span>
-   <span id="0e74">The condition here is also very important! Without a condition, all records match and will be deleted.</span>

— Deletes from the pets table any record that either has a name Floofy, a name Doggo, or an id of 3.

    DELETE FROM
    pets
    WHERE
    name IN (‘Floofy’, ‘Doggo’) OR id = 3;

**How to use a seed file to populate data in a database**

-   <span id="687c">Seed files are a great way for us to create records that we want to start our database out with.</span>
-   <span id="80f6">Instead of having to individually add records to our tables or manually entering them in psql or postbird, we can create a file that has all of these records and then just pass this file to psql to run.</span>
-   <span id="28da">Seed files are also great if we ever need to reset our database. We can clear out any records that we have by dropping all of our tables, then just run our seed files to get it into a predetermined starting point. This is great for our personal projects, testing environments, starting values for new tables we create, etc.</span>
-   <span id="22c5">There are two main ways we can use a seed file with psql, the &lt; and the | operators. They perform the same function for us, just in slightly different orders, taking the content of a .sql file and executing in within the psql environment:</span>
-   <span id="19c8">psql -d {database} &lt; {sql filepath}</span>
-   <span id="7ec0">cat {sql filepath} | psql -d {database}</span>

**SQL (continued)**

**How to perform relational database design**

-   <span id="8204">Steps to Designing the Database:</span>
-   <span id="0276">Define the entities. What data are are you storing, what are the fields for each entity?</span>
-   <span id="cd73">You can think of this in similar ways to OOP (object oriented programming).</span>
-   <span id="0cf7">If you wanted to model this information using classes, what classes would you make? Those are generally going to be the tables that are created in your database.</span>
-   <span id="57f4">The attributes of your classes are generally going to be the fields/columns that we need for each table.</span>
-   <span id="0681">Identify primary keys. Most of the time these will be ids that you can generate as a serial field, incrementing with each addition to the database.</span>
-   <span id="99da">Establish table relationships. Connect related data together with foreign keys. Know how we store these keys in a one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many relationship.</span>
-   <span id="c8c4">With a one-to-one or one-to-many relationship, we are able to use a foreign key on the table to indicate the other specific record that it is connected to.</span>
-   <span id="2e56">With a many-to-many relationship, each record could be connected to multiple records, so we have to create a join table to connect these entities. A record on this join table connects a record from one table to a record from another table.</span>

**How to use transactions to group multiple SQL commands into one succeed or fail operation**

-   <span id="6bfa">We can define an explicit transaction using BEGIN and ending with either COMMIT or ROLLBACK.</span>
-   <span id="0c34">If any command inside the block fails, everything will be rolled back. We can also specify that we want to roll back at the end of the block instead of committing. We saw that this can be useful when analyzing operations that would manipulate our database.</span>

<!-- -->

    BEGIN;
    UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance — 100.00
    WHERE name = ‘Alice’;
    UPDATE branches SET balance = balance — 100.00
    WHERE name = (SELECT branch_name FROM accounts WHERE name = ‘Alice’);
    UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100.00
    WHERE name = ‘Bob’;
    UPDATE branches SET balance = balance + 100.00
    WHERE name = (SELECT branch_name FROM accounts WHERE name = ‘Bob’);
    COMMIT;

    BEGIN;
    EXPLAIN ANALYZE
    UPDATE cities
    SET city = ‘New York City’
    WHERE city = ‘New York’;
    ROLLBACK;

**How to apply indexes to tables to improve performance**

-   <span id="704c">An index can help optimize queries that we have to run regularly. If we are constantly looking up records in a table by a particular field (such as username or phone number), we can add an index in order to speed up this process.</span>
-   <span id="142a">An index maintains a sorted version of the field with a reference to the record that it points to in the table (via primary key). If we want to find a record based on a field that we have an index for, we can look through this index in a more efficient manner than having to scan through the entire table (generally O(log n) since the index is sorted, instead of O(n) for a sequential scan).</span>
-   <span id="2c8f">To add an index to a field we can use the following syntax:</span>

<!-- -->

    CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name (column_name);

-   <span id="a6d3">To drop an index we can do the following:</span>

<!-- -->

    DROP INDEX index_name

-   <span id="12fa">Making an index is not always the best approach. Indices allow for faster lookup, but slow down record insertion and the updating of associated fields, since we not only have to add the information to the table, but also manipulate the index.</span>
-   <span id="0ef6">We generally wouldn t care about adding an index if:</span>
-   <span id="8833">The tables are small</span>
-   <span id="b3b0">We are updating the table frequently, especially the associated columns</span>
-   <span id="5ebd">The column has many NULL values</span>

**Explain what the EXPLAIN command is used for:**

-   <span id="36da">EXPLAIN gives us information about how a query will run (the query plan)</span>
-   <span id="482c">It gives us an idea of how our database will search for data as well as a qualitative comparitor for how expensive that operation will be. Comparing the cost of two queries will tell us which one is more efficient (lower cost).</span>
-   <span id="c7c7">We can also use the ANALYZE command with EXPLAIN, which will actually run the specified query. Doing so gives us more detailed information, such as the milliseconds it took our query to execute as well as specifics like the exact number of rows filtered and returned.</span>

1.  Demonstrate how to install and use the node-postgres library and its Pool class to query a PostgreSQL-managed database

-   <span id="8f73">We can add the node-postgres library to our application with npm install pg. From there we will typically use the Pool class associated with this library. That way we can run many SQL queries with one database connection (as opposed to Client, which closes the connection after a query).</span>

<!-- -->

    const { Pool } = require(‘pg’);

// If we need to specify a username, password, or database, we can do so when we create a Pool instance, otherwise the default values for logging in to psql are used:

    const pool = new Pool({ username: ‘<<username>>’, password: ‘<<password>>’, database: ‘<<database>>’})

-   <span id="a267">The query method on the Pool instance will allow us to execute a SQL query on our database. We can pass in a string that represents the query we want to run</span>

<!-- -->

    const allAirportsSql = `
    SELECT id, city_id, faa_id, name
    FROM airports;
    `;

    async function selectAllAirports() {
    const results = await pool.query(allAirportsSql);
    console.log(results.rows);
    pool.end(); // invoking end() will close our connection to the database
    }

selectAllAirports();

-   <span id="edf8">The return value of this asynchronous function is an object with a rows key that points to an array of objects, each object representing a record with field names as keys.</span>

**Explain how to write prepared statements with placeholders for parameters of the form $1 , $2 , and so on**

-   <span id="ee72">The prepared statement (SQL string that we wrote) can also be made more dynamic by allowing for parameters to be passed in.</span>
-   <span id="3b64">The Pool instance s query function allows us to pass a second argument, an array of parameters to be used in the query string. The location of the parameter substitutions are designated with $1, $2, etc., to signify the first, second, etc., arguments.</span>

<!-- -->

    const airportsByNameSql = `
    SELECT name, faa_id
    FROM airports
    WHERE UPPER(name) LIKE UPPER($1)
    `;

async function selectAirportsByName(name) {  
const results = await pool.query(airportsByNameSql, \[ \`%${name}%\` \]);  
console.log(results.rows);  
pool.end(); // invoking end() will close our connection to the database  
}

    // Get the airport name from the command line and store it
    // in the variable “name”. Pass that value to the
    // selectAirportsByName function.
    const name = process.argv[2];
    // console.log(name);
    selectAirportsByName(name);

**ORM**

1.  How to install, configure, and use Sequelize, an ORM for JavaScript

-   <span id="0e86">To start a new project we use our standard npm initialize statement</span>
-   <span id="7bf0">npm init -y</span>
-   <span id="564b">Add in the packages we will need (sequelize, sequelize-cli, and pg)</span>
-   <span id="9c9b">npm install sequelize@⁵.0.0 sequelize-cli@⁵.0.0 pg@⁸.0.0</span>
-   <span id="0b1c">Initialize sequelize in our project</span>
-   <span id="8052">npx sequelize-cli init</span>
-   <span id="d03e">Create a database user with credentials we will use for the project</span>
-   <span id="bbc8">psql</span>
-   <span id="caca">CREATE USER example\_user WITH PASSWORD ‘badpassword’</span>
-   <span id="72ab">Here we can also create databases since we are already in postgres</span>

<!-- -->

    CREATE DATABASE example_app_development WITH OWNER example_user

    CREATE DATABASE example_app_test WITH OWNER example_user

    CREATE DATABASE example_app_production WITH OWNER example_user

-   <span id="ae27">If we don t create these databases now, we could also create them after we make our changes to our config file. If we take this approach, we need to make sure our user that we created has the CREATEDB option when we make them, since sequelize will attempt to make the databases with this user. This other approach would look like:</span>
-   <span id="f6a3">In psql: CREATE USER example\_user WITH PASSWORD ‘badpassword’ CREATEDB</span>
-   <span id="45ac">In terminal: npx sequelize-cli db:create</span>
-   <span id="cff2">Double check that our configuration file matches our username, password, database, dialect, and seederStorage (these will be filled out for you in an assessment scenario):</span>

<!-- -->

    “development”: {
    “username”: “sequelize_recipe_box_app”,

1.  How to use database migrations to make your database grow with your application in a source-control enabled way

**Migrations**

-   <span id="3710">In order to make new database tables and sequelize models that reflect them, we want to generate a migration file and model file using model:generate</span>

<!-- -->

    npx sequelize-cli model:generate — name Cat — attributes “firstName:string,specialSkill:string”

-   <span id="bc91">Here we are creating a migration file and a model file for a Cat. We are specifying that we want this table to have fields for firstName and specialSkill. Sequelize will automatically make fields for an id, createdAt, and updatedAt, as well, so we do not need to specify these.</span>
-   <span id="4d04">Once our migration file is created, we can go in and edit any details that we need to. Most often we will want to add in database constraints such as allowNull: false, adding a uniqueness constraint with unique: true, adding in character limits to fields such as type: Sequelize.STRING(100), or specifying a foreign key with references to another table references: { model: ‘Categories’ }.</span>
-   <span id="ca79">After we make any necessary changes to our migration file, we need to perform the migration, which will run the SQL commands to actually create the table.</span>

<!-- -->

    npx sequelize-cli db:migrate

-   <span id="78a8">This command runs any migration files that have not been previously run, in the order that they were created (this is why the timestamp in the file name is important)</span>
-   <span id="0790">If we realize that we made a mistake after migrating, we can undo our previous migration, or all of our migrations. After undoing them, we can make any changes necessary to our migration files (They won t be deleted from the undo, so we don t need to generate anything! Just make the necessary changes to the files that already exist and save the files.). Running the migrations again will make the tables with the updates reflected.</span>

<!-- -->

    npx sequelize-cli db:migrate:undo

    npx sequelize-cli db:migrate:undo:all

**Models Validations and Associations**

-   <span id="a4dd">In addition to the migration files, our model:generate command also created a model file for us. This file is what allows sequelize to transform the results of its SQL queries into useful JavaScript objects for us.</span>
-   <span id="5c70">The model is where we can specify a validation that we want to perform before trying to run a SQL query. If the validation fails, we can respond with a message instead of running the query, which can be an expensive operation that we know won t work.</span>

<!-- -->

    // Before we make changes, sequelize generates the type that this field represents specification:
    DataTypes.TEXT
    // We can replace the generated format with an object to specify not only the type, but the validations that we want to implement. The validations can also take in messages the respond with on failure and arguments.
    specification: {
        type: DataTypes.TEXT,
        validate: {
            notEmpty: {
                msg: 'The specification cannot be empty'
            },
            len: {
                args: [10, 100]
                msg: 'The specifcation must be between 10 and 100 characters'
            }
        }
    }

-   <span id="94ef">Another key part of the model file is setting up our associations. We can use the belongsTo, hasMany, and belongsToMany methods to set up model-level associations. Doing so is what creates the helpful functionality like addOwner that we saw in the pets example, a function that automatically generates the SQL necessary to create a petOwner record and supplies the appropriate petId and ownerId.</span>
-   <span id="e5fc">In a one-to-many association, we need to have a belongsTo association on the many side, and a hasMany association on the one side:</span>
-   <span id="21c2">Instruction.belongsTo(models.Recipe, { foreignKey: ‘recipeId’ });</span>
-   <span id="6e6b">Recipe.hasMany(models.Instruction, { foreignKey: ‘recipeId’ });</span>
-   <span id="7d6a">In a many-to-many association, we need to have a belongsToMany on each side of the association. We generally specify a columnMapping object to show the association more clearly:</span>

<!-- -->

    // In our Owner model

    // To connect this Owner to a Pet through the PetOwner

    const columnMapping = {

    through: ‘PetOwner’,

    // joins table

    otherKey: ‘petId’,

    // key that connects to other table we have a many association with foreignKey: ‘ownerId’

    // our foreign key in the joins table

    }

    Owner.belongsToMany( models.Pet, columnMapping );

    // In our Pet model

    // To connect this Pet to an Owner through the PetOwner

    const columnMapping = { through: ‘PetOwner’,

    // joins table

    otherKey: ‘ownerId’,

    // key that connects to other table we have a many association with

    foreignKey: ‘petId’

    // our foreign key in the joins table

    }

    Pet.belongsToMany( models.Owner, columnMapping );

### **How to perform CRUD operations with Sequelize**

-   <span id="fc1a">Seed Files</span>
-   <span id="ad49">Seed files can be used to populate our database with starter data.</span>
-   <span id="9058">npx sequelize-cli seed:generate — name add-cats</span>
-   <span id="d2cf">up indicates what to create when we seed our database, down indicates what to delete if we want to unseed the database.</span>
-   <span id="d605">For our up, we use the queryInterface.bulkInsert() method, which takes in the name of the table to seed and an array of objects representing the records we want to create:</span>

<!-- -->

    up: (queryInterface, Sequelize) => {
        return queryInterface.bulkInsert('<<TableName>>', [{
            field1: value1a,
            field2: value2a
        }, {
            field1: value1b,
            field2: value2b
        }, {
            field1: value1c,
            field2: value2c
        }]);
    }

-   <span id="0cb9">For our down, we use the queryInterface.bulkDelete() method, which takes in the name of the table and an object representing our WHERE clause. Unseeding will delete all records from the specified table that match the WHERE clause.</span>

<!-- -->

    // If we want to specify what to remove:
    down: (queryInterface, Sequelize) => {
    return queryInterface.bulkDelete(‘<<TableName>>’, {
    field1: [value1a, value1b, value1c], //…etc.
    });
    };
    // If we want to remove everything from the table:
    down: (queryInterface, Sequelize) => {
    return queryInterface.bulkDelete(‘<<TableName>>’, null, {});
    };

-   <span id="c9e3">Running npx sequelize-cli db:seed:all will run all of our seeder files.</span>
-   <span id="8778">npx sequelize-cli db:seed:undo:all will undo all of our seeding.</span>
-   <span id="d655">If we omit the :all we can run specific seed files</span>
-   <span id="4788">Inserting with Build and Create</span>
-   <span id="fc2d">In addition to seed files, which we generally use for starter data, we can create new records in our database by using build and save, or the combined create</span>
-   <span id="3807">Use the .build method of the Cat model to create a new Cat instance in index.js</span>

<!-- -->

    // Constructs an instance of the JavaScript `Cat` class. **Does not
    // save anything to the database yet**. Attributes are passed in as a
    // POJO.
    const newCat = Cat.build({
        firstName: 'Markov',
        specialSkill: 'sleeping',
        age: 5
    });
    // This actually creates a new `Cats` record in the database. We must
    // wait for this asynchronous operation to succeed.
    await newCat.save();
    // This builds and saves all in one step. If we don't need to perform any operations on the instance before saving it, this can optimize our code.
    const newerCat = await Cat.create({
        firstName: 'Whiskers',
        specialSkill: 'sleeping',
        age: 2
    })

**Updating Records**

-   <span id="4ecc">When we have a reference to an instance of a model (i.e. after we have queried for it or created it), we can update values by simply reassigning those fields and using the save method</span>

**Deleting Records**

-   <span id="606a">When we have a reference to an instance of a model, we can delete that record by using destroy</span>
-   <span id="be30">const cat = await Cat.findByPk(1); // Remove the Markov record. await cat.destroy();</span>
-   <span id="0b7f">We can also call destroy on the model itself. By passing in an object that specifies a where clause, we can destroy all records that match that query</span>
-   <span id="5f9f">await Cat.destroy({ where: { specialSkill: ‘jumping’ } });</span>

**How to query using Sequelize**

**findAll**

    const cats = await Cat.findAll();
    // Log the fetched cats.
    // The extra arguments to stringify are a replacer and a space respectively
    // Here we're specifying a space of 2 in order to print more legibly
    // We don't want a replacer, so we pass null just so that we can pass a 3rd argument
    console.log(JSON.stringify(cats, null, 2));

**WHERE clause**

-   <span id="e68d">Passing an object to findAll can add on clauses to our query</span>
-   <span id="ec33">The where key takes an object as a value to indicate what we are filtering by</span>
-   <span id="aa61">{ where: { field: value } } =&gt; WHERE field = value</span>

<!-- -->

    const cats = await Cat.findAll({ where: { firstName: “Markov” } }); console.log(JSON.stringify(cats, null, 2));

**OR in the WHERE clause**

-   <span id="755e">Using an array for the value tells sequelize we want to match any of these values</span>

{ where: { field: \[value1, value2\] } =&gt; WHERE field IN (value1, value2)

    const cats = await Cat.findAll({ where: { firstName: [“Markov”, “Curie”] } });const cats = await Cat.findAll({
        where: {
            firstName: "Markov",
            age: 4
        }
    });
    console.log(JSON.stringify(cats, null, 2));
    console.log(JSON.stringify(cats, null, 2));
    AND in the WHERE clause

    Providing additional key/value pairs to the where object indicates all filters must match
    { where: { field1: value1, field2: value2 } } => WHERE field1 = value1 AND field2 = value2

    Sequelize Op operator

    By requiring Op from the sequelize library we can provide more advanced comparison operators
    const { Op } = require(“sequelize”);
    Op.ne: Not equal operator

    const cats = await Cat.findAll({
        where: {
            firstName: {
                // All cats where the name is not equal to "Markov"
                // We use brackets in order to evaluate Op.ne and use the value as the key
                [Op.ne]: "Markov"
            },
        },
    });
    console.log(JSON.stringify(cats, null, 2));

### Op.and: and operator

    const cats = await Cat.findAll({
        where: {
            // The array that Op.and points to must all be true 
            // Here, we find cats where the name is not "Markov" and the age is 4
            [Op.and]: [{
                firstName: {
                    [Op.ne]: "Markov"
                }
            }, {
                age: 4
            }, ],
        },
    });
    console.log(JSON.stringify(cats, null, 2));

### Op.or: or operator

    const cats = await Cat.findAll({
        where: {
            // One condition in the array that Op.or points to must be true 
            // Here, we find cats where the name is "Markov" or where the age is 4
            [Op.or]: [{
                firstName: "Markov"
            }, {
                age: 4
            }, ],
        },
    });
    console.log(JSON.stringify(cats, null, 2));

Op.gt and Op.lt: greater than and less than operators

const cats = await Cat.findAll({ where: { // Find all cats where the age is greater than 4 age: { \[Op.gt\]: 4 }, } }, }); console.log(JSON.stringify(cats, null, 2));

#### Ordering results

-   <span id="4ee4">Just like the where clause, we can pass an order key to specify we want our results ordered</span>
-   <span id="46a6">The key order points to an array with the fields that we want to order by</span>
-   <span id="ba7f">By default, the order is ascending, just like standard SQL. If we want to specify descending, we can instead use a nested array with the field name as the first element and DESC as the second element. (We could also specify ASC as a second element in a nested array, but it is unnecessary as it is default)</span>
-   <span id="f9f9">const cats = await Cat.findAll({ // Order by age descending, then by firstName ascending if cats have the same age order: \[\[“age”, “DESC”\], “firstName”\], }); console.log(JSON.stringify(cats, null, 2));</span>

<!-- -->

    // Get a reference to the cat record that we want to update (here just the cat with primary key of 1)
    const cat = await Cat.findByPk(1);
    // Change cat's attributes.
    cat.firstName = "Curie";
    cat.specialSkill = "jumping";
    cat.age = 123;
    // Save the new name to the database.
    await cat.save();

-   <span id="c46e">Limiting results</span>
-   <span id="8e6f">We can provide a limit key in order to limit our results to a specified number</span>

<!-- -->

    const cats = await Cat.findAll({
        order: [
            ["age", "DESC"]
        ],
        // Here we are limiting our results to one record. It will still return an array, just with one object inside. We could have said any number here, the result is always an array. 
        limit: 1,
    });
    console.log(JSON.stringify(cats, null, 2));

### findOne

-   <span id="0151">If we only want one record to be returned we can use findOne instead of findAll</span>
-   <span id="2a32">If multiple records would have matched our findOne query, it will return the first record</span>
-   <span id="4c25">Unlike findAll, findOne will return the object directly instead of an array. If no records matched the query it will return null.</span>

<!-- -->

    // finds the oldest cat const cat = await Cat.findOne({ order: [[“age”, “DESC”]], }); console.log(JSON.stringify(cat, null, 2));

-   <span id="3bc7">**Querying with Associations**</span>

We can include associated data by adding an include key to our options object

    const pet = Pet.findByPk(1, {
        include: [PetType, Owner]
    });
    console.log(pet.id, pet.name, pet.age, pet.petTypeId, pet.PetType.type, pet.Owners

We can get nested associations by having include point to an object that specifies which model we have an association with, then chaining an association on with another include

**How to perform data validations with Sequelize**

-   <span id="e654">See the database migrations section above.</span>
-   <span id="9f26">In general, we add in a validate key to each field that we want validations for. This key points to an object that specifies all of the validations we want to make on that field, such as notEmpty, notNull, len, isIn, etc.</span>

<!-- -->

    specification: {
        type: DataTypes.TEXT,
        validate: {
            notEmpty: {
                msg: 'The specification cannot be empty'
            },
            len: {
                args: [10, 100]
                msg: 'The specifcation must be between 10 and 100 characters'
            }
        }
    }

**How to use transactions with Sequelize**

-   <span id="1059">We can create a transaction block in order to make sure either all operations are performed or none of them are</span>
-   <span id="a632">We use the .transaction method in order to create our block. The method takes in a callback with an argument to track our transaction id (typically just a simple tx variable).</span>
-   <span id="79f9">All of our sequelize operations can be passed a transaction key on their options argument which points to our transaction id. This indicates that this operation is part of the transaction block and should only be executed in the database when the whole block executes without error.</span>

<!-- -->

    async function main() {
        try {
            // Do all database access within the transaction.
            await sequelize.transaction(async (tx) => {
                // Fetch Markov and Curie's accounts.
                const markovAccount = await BankAccount.findByPk(
                    1, {
                        transaction: tx
                    },
                );
                const curieAccount = await BankAccount.findByPk(
                    2, {
                        transaction: tx
                    }
                );
                // No one can mess with Markov or Curie's accounts until the
                // transaction completes! The account data has been locked!
                // Increment Curie's balance by $5,000.
                curieAccount.balance += 5000;
                await curieAccount.save({
                    transaction: tx
                });
                // Decrement Markov's balance by $5,000.
                markovAccount.balance -= 5000;
                await markovAccount.save({
                    transaction: tx
                });
            });
        } catch (err) {
            // Report if anything goes wrong.
            console.log("Error!");
            for (const e of err.errors) {
                console.log(
                    `${e.instance.clientName}: ${e.message}`
                );
            }

### Sequelize Cheatsheet

#### Command Line

Sequelize provides utilities for generating migrations, models, and seed files. They are exposed through the `sequelize-cli` command.

#### Init Project

    $ npx sequelize-cli init

You must create a database user, and update the `config/config.json` file to match your database settings to complete the initialization process.

#### Create Database

    npx sequelize-cli db:create

#### Generate a model and its migration

    npx sequelize-cli model:generate --name <ModelName> --attributes <column1>:<type>,<column2>:<type>,...

#### Run pending migrations

    npx sequelize-cli db:migrate

#### Rollback one migration

    npx sequelize-cli db:migrate:undo

#### Rollback all migrations

    npx sequelize-cli db:migrate:undo:all

#### Generate a new seed file

    npx sequelize-cli seed:generate --name <descriptiveName>

#### Run all pending seeds

    npx sequelize-cli db:seed:all

#### Rollback one seed

    npx sequelize-cli db:seed:undo

#### Rollback all seeds

    npx sequelize-cli db:seed:undo:all

#### Migrations

### Create Table (usually used in the up() method)

    // This uses the short form for references
    return queryInterface.createTable(<TableName>, {
        <columnName>: {
            type: Sequelize.<type>,
            allowNull: <true|false>,
            unique: <true|false>,
            references: { model: <TableName> }, // This is the plural table name
                                                // that the column references.
        }
    });
    // This the longer form for references that is less confusing
    return queryInterface.createTable(<TableName>, {
        <columnName>: {
            type: Sequelize.<type>,
            allowNull: <true|false>,
            unique: <true|false>,
            references: {
                model: {
                    tableName: <TableName> // This is the plural table name
                }
            }
        }
    });

### Delete Table (usually used in the down() function)

    return queryInterface.dropTable(<TableName>);

### Adding a column

    return queryInteface.addColumn(<TableName>, <columnName>: {
        type: Sequelize.<type>,
        allowNull: <true|false>,
        unique: <true|false>,
        references: { model: <TableName> }, // This is the plural table name
                                            // that the column references.
    });

### Removing a column

    return queryInterface.removeColumn(<TableName>, <columnName>);

### Model Associations

### One to One between Student and Scholarship

`student.js`

    Student.hasOne(models.Scholarship, { foreignKey: 'studentId' });

`scholarship.js`

    Scholarship.belongsTo(models.Student, { foreignKey: 'studentId' });

### One to Many between Student and Class

`student.js`

    Student.belongsTo(models.Class, { foreignKey: 'classId' });

`class.js`

    Class.hasMany(models.Student, { foreignKey: 'classId' });

### Many to Many between Student and Lesson through StudentLessons table

`student.js`

    const columnMapping = {
        through: 'StudentLesson', // This is the model name referencing the join table.
        otherKey: 'lessonId',
        foreignKey: 'studentId'
    }
    Student.belongsToMany(models.Lesson, columnMapping);

`lesson.js`

    const columnMapping = {
        through: 'StudentLesson', // This is the model name referencing the join table.
        otherKey: 'studentId',
        foreignKey: 'lessonId'
    }
    Lesson.belongsToMany(models.Student, columnMapping);

### Inserting a new item

    // Way 1 - With build and save
    const pet = Pet.build({
        name: "Fido",
        petTypeId: 1
    });
    await pet.save();
    // Way 2 - With create
    const pet = await Pet.create({
        name: "Fido",
        petTypeId: 1
    });

### Updating an item

    // Find the pet with id = 1
    const pet = await Pet.findByPk(1);
    // Way 1
    pet.name = "Fido, Sr."
    await pet.save;
    // Way 2
    await pet.update({
        name: "Fido, Sr."
    });

### Deleting a single item

    // Find the pet with id = 1
    const pet = await Pet.findByPk(1);
    // Notice this is an instance method
    pet.destroy();

### Deleting multiple items

    // Notice this is a static class method
    await Pet.destroy({
        where: {
            petTypeId: 1 // Destorys all the pets where the petType is 1
        }
    });

### Query Format

### findOne

    await <Model>.findOne({
        where: {
            <column>: {
                [Op.<operator>]: <value>
            }
        },
    });

### findAll

    await <Model>.findAll({
        where: {
            <column>: {
                [Op.<operator>]: <value>
            }
        },
        include: <include_specifier>,
        offset: 10,
        limit: 2
    });

### findByPk

    await <Model>.findByPk(<primary_key>, {
        include: <include_specifier>
    });

### Eager loading associations with `include`

Simple include of one related model.

    await Pet.findByPk(1,  {
            include: PetType
        })

Include can take an array of models if you need to include more than one.

    await Pet.findByPk(1, {
            include: [Pet, Owner]
        })

Include can also take an object with keys `model` and `include`.  
This is in case you have nested associations.  
In this case Owner doesn’t have an association with PetType, but  
Pet does, so we want to include PetType onto the Pet Model.

    await Owner.findByPk(1, {
            include: {
                model: Pet
                include: PetType
            }
        });

### toJSON method

The confusingly named toJSON() method does **not** return a JSON string but instead  
returns a POJO for the instance.

    // pet is an instance of the Pet class
    const pet = await Pet.findByPk(1);
    console.log(pet) // prints a giant object with
                     // tons of properties and methods
    // petPOJO is now just a plain old Javascript Object
    const petPOJO = pet.toJSON();
    console.log(petPOJO); // { name: "Fido", petTypeId: 1 }

### Common Where Operators

    const Op = Sequelize.Op
    [Op.and]: [{a: 5}, {b: 6}] // (a = 5) AND (b = 6)
    [Op.or]: [{a: 5}, {a: 6}]  // (a = 5 OR a = 6)
    [Op.gt]: 6,                // > 6
    [Op.gte]: 6,               // >= 6
    [Op.lt]: 10,               // < 10
    [Op.lte]: 10,              // <= 10
    [Op.ne]: 20,               // != 20
    [Op.eq]: 3,                // = 3
    [Op.is]: null              // IS NULL
    [Op.not]: true,            // IS NOT TRUE
    [Op.between]: [6, 10],     // BETWEEN 6 AND 10
    [Op.notBetween]: [11, 15], // NOT BETWEEN 11 AND 15
    [Op.in]: [1, 2],           // IN [1, 2]
    [Op.notIn]: [1, 2],        // NOT IN [1, 2]
    [Op.like]: '%hat',         // LIKE '%hat'
    [Op.notLike]: '%hat'       // NOT LIKE '%hat'
    [Op.iLike]: '%hat'         // ILIKE '%hat' (case insensitive) (PG only)
    [Op.notILike]: '%hat'      // NOT ILIKE '%hat'  (PG only)
    [Op.startsWith]: 'hat'     // LIKE 'hat%'
    [Op.endsWith]: 'hat'       // LIKE '%hat'
    [Op.substring]: 'hat'      // LIKE '%hat%'
    [Op.regexp]: '^[h|a|t]'    // REGEXP/~ '^[h|a|t]' (MySQL/PG only)
    [Op.notRegexp]: '^[h|a|t]' // NOT REGEXP/!~ '^[h|a|t]' (MySQL/PG only)
    [Op.iRegexp]: '^[h|a|t]'    // ~* '^[h|a|t]' (PG only)
    [Op.notIRegexp]: '^[h|a|t]' // !~* '^[h|a|t]' (PG only)
    [Op.like]: { [Op.any]: ['cat', 'hat']}

You can access and query the data using the `findByPk`, `findOne`, and `findAll` methods. First, make sure you import the models in your JavaScript file. In this case, we are assuming your JavaScript file is in the root of your project and so is the models folder.

    const { Recipe, Ingredient, Instruction, MeasurementUnit } = require('./models');

The models folder exports each of the models that you have created. We have these four in our data model, so we will destructure the models to access each table individually. The associations that you have defined in each of your models will allow you to access data of related tables when you query your database using the `include` option.

If you want to find all recipes, for the recipe list, you would use the `findAll` method. You need to await this, so make sure your function is async.

    async function findAllRecipes() {
    return await Recipe.findAll();
    }
    If you would like to include all the ingredients so you can create a shopping list for all the recipes, you would use include. This is possible because of the association you have defined in your Recipe and Ingredient models.
    async function getShoppingList() {
    return await Recipe.findAll({ include: [ Ingredient ] });
    }
    If you only want to find one where there is chicken in the ingredients list, you would use findOne and findByPk.
    async function findAChickenRecipe() {
    const chickenRecipe = await Ingredient.findOne({
    where: {
    foodStuff: 'chicken'
    }
    });
    return await Recipe.findByPk(chickenRecipe.recipeId);
    }
    Data Access to Create/Update/Delete Rows
    You have two options when you want to create a row in a table (where you are saving one record into the table). You can either .build the row and then .save it, or you can .create it. Either way it does the same thing. Here are some examples:
    Let’s say we have a form that accepts the name of the recipe (for simplicity). When we get the results of the form, we can:
    const newRecipe = await Recipe.build({ title: 'Chicken Noodle Soup' });
    await newRecipe.save();
    This just created our new recipe and added it to our Recipes table. You can do the same thing like this:
    await Recipe.create({ title: 'Chicken Noodle Soup' });

If you want to modify an item in your table, you can use `update`. Let’s say we want to change the chicken noodle soup to chicken noodle soup with extra veggies, first we need to get the recipe, then we can update it.

    const modRecipe = await Recipe.findOne({ where: { title: 'Chicken Noodle Soup' } });
    await modRecipe.update({ title: 'Chicken Noodle Soup with Extra Veggies' });
    To delete an item from your table, you will do the same kind of process. Find the recipe you want to delete and destroy it, like this:
    const deleteThis = await Recipe.findOne({ where: { title: 'Chicken Noodle Soup with Extra Veggies' } });
    await deleteThis.destroy();
    NOTE: If you do not await these, you will receive a promise, so you will need to use .then and .catch to do more with the items you are accessing and modifying.
    Documentation
    For the data types and validations in your models, here are the official docs. The sequelize docs are hard to look at, so these are the specific sections with just the lists:

    Sequelize Data Types: https://sequelize.org/v5/manual/data-types.html

    Validations: https://sequelize.org/v5/manual/models-definition.html#validations

    When you access the data in your queries, here are the operators available, again because the docs are hard to navigate, this is the specific section with the list of operators.

    Operators: https://sequelize.org/v5/manual/querying.html#operators

    The documentation for building, saving, creating, updating and destroying is linked here, it does a pretty good job of explaining in my opinion, it just has a title that we have not been using in this course. When they talk about an instance, they mean an item stored in your table.

    Create/Update/Destroy: https://sequelize.org/v5/manual/instances.html

    Everything You Need to Get Started With VSCode + Extensions & Resources
    Every extension or tool you could possibly need



    Here’s a rudimentary static site I made that goes into more detail on the extensions I use…
    VSCodeExtensions
     5fff5b9a2430bb564bfd451d–stoic-mccarthy-2c335f.netlify.app
    Here’s the repo it was deployed from:
    https://github.com/bgoonz/vscode-Extension-readmes

    Commands:

    Command Palette


    Access all available commands based on your current context.


    Keyboard Shortcut: Ctrl+Shift+P

    Tips-N-Tricks:
    Here is a selection of common features for editing code. If the keyboard shortcuts aren’t comfortable for you, consider installing a keymap extension for your old editor.
    Tip: You can see recommended keymap extensions in the Extensions view with Ctrl+K Ctrl+M which filters the search to @recommended:keymaps.
    Multi cursor selection
    To add cursors at arbitrary positions, select a position with your mouse and use Alt+Click (Option+click on macOS).
    To set cursors above or below the current position use:
    Keyboard Shortcut: Ctrl+Alt+Up or Ctrl+Alt+Down



    You can add additional cursors to all occurrences of the current selection with Ctrl+Shift+L.



    Note: You can also change the modifier to Ctrl/Cmd for applying multiple cursors with the editor.multiCursorModifier setting . See Multi-cursor Modifier for details.
    If you do not want to add all occurrences of the current selection, you can use Ctrl+D instead. This only selects the next occurrence after the one you selected so you can add selections one by one.



    Column (box) selection
    You can select blocks of text by holding Shift+Alt (Shift+Option on macOS) while you drag your mouse. A separate cursor will be added to the end of each selected line.



    You can also use keyboard shortcuts to trigger column selection.

    Express APIs Part 2:
    Overview

    Express APIs Part 2:
    Overview
    REST is a generally agreed-upon set of principles and constraints. They are recommendations, not a standard.
    // inside /api/apiRoutes.js <- this can be place anywhere and called anything
    const express = require('express');
    // if the other routers are not nested inside /api then the paths would change
    const userRoutes = require('./users/userRoutes');
    const productRoutes = require('./products/productRoutes');
    const clientRoutes = require('./clients/clientRoutes');
    const router = express.Router(); // notice the Uppercase R
    // this file will only be used when the route begins with "/api"
    // so we can remove that from the URLs, so "/api/users" becomes simply "/users"
    router.use('/users', userRoutes);
    router.use('/products', productRoutes);
    router.use('/clients', clientRoutes);
    // .. and any other endpoint related to the user's resource
    // after the route has been fully configured, we then export it so it can be required where needed

    module.exports = router; // standard convention dictates that this is the last line on the file



    Objective 1 — explain the role of a foreign key
    Overview
    Foreign keys are a type of table field used for creating links between tables. Like primary keys, they are most often integers that identify (rather than store) data. However, whereas a primary key is used to id rows in a table, foreign keys are used to connect a record in one table to a record in a second table.
    Follow Along
    Consider the following farms and ranchers tables.
    Untitled
    Untitled
    The farm_id in the ranchers table is an example of a foreign key. Each entry in the farm_id (foreign key) column corresponds to an id (primary key) in the farms table. This allows us to track which farm each rancher belongs to while keeping the tables normalized.
    If we could only see the ranchers table, we would know that John, Jane, and Jen all work together and that Jim and Jay also work together. However, to know where any of them work, we would need to look at the farms table.

    Objective 2 — query data from multiple tables
    Now that we understand the basics of querying data from a single table, let’s move on to selecting data from multiple tables using JOIN operations.
    Overview
    We can use a JOIN to combine query data from multiple tables using a single SELECT statement.
    There are different types of joins; some are listed below:

    inner joins.
    outer joins.
    left joins.
    right joins.
    cross joins.
    non-equality joins.
    self joins.

    Using joins requires that the two tables of interest contain at least one field with shared information. For example, if a departments table has an id field, and an employee table has a department_id field, and the values that exist in the id column of the departments table live in the department_id field of the employee table, we can use those fields to join both tables like so:
    select * from employees
    join departments on employees.department_id = departments.id

This query will return the data from both tables for every instance where the `ON` condition is true. If there are employees with no value for department*id or where the value stored in the field does not correspond to an existing id in the* departments *table, then that record will NOT be returned. In a similar fashion, any records from the* departments *table that don’t have an employee associated with them will also be omitted from the results. Basically, if the* id\* does not show as the value of department\_id for an employee, it won’t be able to join.

We can shorten the condition by giving the table names an alias. This is a common practice. Below is the same example using aliases, picking which fields to return and sorting the results:

    select d.id, d.name, e.id, e.first_name, e.last_name, e.salary
    from employees as e
    join departments as d
      on e.department_id = d.id
    order by d.name, e.last_name

Notice that we can take advantage of white space and indentation to make queries more readable.

There are several ways of writing joins, but the one shown here should work on all database management systems and avoid some pitfalls, so we recommend it.

The syntax for performing a similar join using Knex is as follows:

    db('employees as e')
      .join('departments as d', 'e.department_id', 'd.id')
      .select('d.id', 'd.name', 'e.first_name', 'e.last_name', 'e.salary')

### Follow Along

A good explanation of how the different types of joins can be seen <a href="https://www.w3resource.com/sql/joins/sql-joins.php" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">in this article from w3resource.com (Links to an external site.)</a>.

### Challenge

Use <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/Sql/tryit.asp?filename=trysql_select_top" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">this online tool (Links to an external site.)</a> to write the following queries:

-   <span id="9ccf">list the products, including their category name.</span>
-   <span id="b07f">list the products, including the supplier name.</span>
-   <span id="7b08">list the products, including both the category name and supplier name.</span>

### What is SQL Joins?

An SQL JOIN clause combines rows from two or more tables. It creates a set of rows in a temporary table.

### How to Join two tables in SQL?

A JOIN works on two or more tables if they have at least one common field and have a relationship between them.

JOIN keeps the base tables (structure and data) unchanged.

### Join vs. Subquery

-   <span id="eeea">JOINs are faster than a subquery and it is very rare that the opposite.</span>
-   <span id="3b2e">In JOINs the RDBMS calculates an execution plan, that can predict, what data should be loaded and how much it will take to processed and as a result this process save some times, unlike the subquery there is no pre-process calculation and run all the queries and load all their data to do the processing.</span>
-   <span id="84ce">A JOIN is checked conditions first and then put it into table and displays; where as a subquery take separate temp table internally and checking condition.</span>
-   <span id="3002">When joins are using, there should be connection between two or more than two tables and each table has a relation with other while subquery means query inside another query, has no need to relation, it works on columns and conditions.</span>

### SQL JOINS: EQUI JOIN and NON EQUI JOIN

The are two types of SQL JOINS — EQUI JOIN and NON EQUI JOIN

1.  <span id="31e6">SQL EQUI JOIN :</span>

The SQL EQUI JOIN is a simple SQL join uses the equal sign(=) as the comparison operator for the condition. It has two types — SQL Outer join and SQL Inner join.

1.  <span id="d86b">SQL NON EQUI JOIN :</span>

The **SQL NON EQUI JOIN** is a join uses comparison operator other than the equal sign like &gt;, &lt;, &gt;=, &lt;= with the condition.

**SQL EQUI JOIN : INNER JOIN and OUTER JOIN**

The SQL EQUI JOIN can be classified into two types — INNER JOIN and OUTER JOIN

1.  <span id="c9b5">SQL INNER JOIN</span>

This type of EQUI JOIN returns all rows from tables where the key record of one table is equal to the key records of another table.

1.  <span id="6bc6">SQL OUTER JOIN</span>

This type of EQUI JOIN returns all rows from one table and only those rows from the secondary table where the joined condition is satisfying i.e. the columns are equal in both tables.

In order to perform a JOIN query, the required information we need are:

**a)** The name of the tables**b)** Name of the columns of two or more tables, based on which a condition will perform.

**Syntax:**

    FROM table1
    join_type table2
    [ON (join_condition)]

**Parameters:**

**Sample table: company**

**Sample table: foods**

To join two tables ‘company’ and ‘foods’, the following SQL statement can be used :

**SQL Code:**

    SELECT  company.company_id,company.company_name,
    foods.item_id,foods.item_name
    FROM company,foods;

Copy

Output:

### Objective 3 — write database access methods

### Overview

While we can write database code directly into our endpoints, best practices dictate that all database logic exists in separate, modular methods. These files containing database access helpers are often called **models**

### Follow Along

To handle CRUD operations for a single resource, we would want to create a **model** (or database access file) containing the following methods:

    function find() {
    }
    function findById(id) {
    }
    function add(user) {
    }
    function update(changes, id) {
    }
    function remove(id) {

    }
    Each of these functions would use Knex logic to perform the necessary database operation.
    function find() {
      return db('users');
    }

For each method, we can choose what value to return. For example, we may prefer `findById()` to return a single `user` object rather than an array.

    function findById(id) {
    // first() returns the first entry in the db matching the query
      return db('users').where({ id }).first();
    }

We can also use existing methods like `findById()` to help `add()` return the new user (instead of just the id).

    function add(user) {
      db('users').insert(user)
        .then(ids => {
          return findById(ids[0]);
        });
    }

Once all methods are written as desired, we can export them like so:

    module.exports = {
      find,
      findById,
      add,
      update,
      delete,
    }

…and use the helpers in our endpoints

    const User = require('./user-model.js');
    router.get('/', (req, res) => {

    User.find()

    .then(users => {

    res.json(users);

    })

    .catch(&nbsp;err => {});

    });
    There should no be knex code in the endpoints themselves.






    A database is a collection of data organized for easy retrieval and manipulation.
    We’re concerned only with digital databases, those that run on computers or other electronic devices. Digital databases have been around since the 1960s. Relational databases, those which store “related” data, are the oldest and most common type of database in use today.
    Data Persistence
    A database is often necessary because our application or code requires data persistence. This term refers to data that is infrequently accessed and not likely to be modified. In less technical terms, the information will be safely stored and remain untouched unless intentionally modified.
    A familiar example of non-persistent data would be JavaScript objects and arrays, which reset each time the code runs.
    Relational Databases
    In relational databases, the data is stored in tabular format grouped into rows and columns (similar to spreadsheets). A collection of rows is called a table. Each row represents a single record in the table and is made up of one or more columns.
    These kinds of databases are relational because a relation is a mathematical idea equivalent to a table. So relational databases are databases that store their data in tables.
    Tables
    Below are some basic facts about tables:

    Tables organize data in rows and columns.


    Each row in a table represents one distinct record.


    Each column represents a field or attribute that is common to all the records.


    Fields should have a descriptive name and a data type appropriate for the attribute it represents.


    Tables usually have more rows than columns.


    Tables have primary keys that uniquely identify each row.


    Foreign keys represent the relationships with other tables.







    SQL:
    SQL is a standard language, which means that it almost certainly will be supported, no matter how your database is managed. That said, be aware that the SQL language can vary depending on database management tools. This lesson focuses on a set of core commands that never change. Learning the standard commands is an excellent introduction since the knowledge transfers between database products.
    The syntax for SQL is English-like and requires fewer symbols than programming languages like C, Java, and JavaScript.
    It is declarative and concise, which means there is a lot less to learn to use it effectively.
    When learning SQL, it is helpful to understand that each command is designed for a different purpose. If we classify the commands by purpose, we’ll end up with the following sub-categories of SQL:

    Data Definition Language (DDL): used to modify database objects. Some examples are: CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE, and DROP TABLE.
    Data Manipulation Language (DML): used to manipulate the data stored in the database. Some examples are: INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.
    Data Query Language (DQL): used to ask questions about the data stored in the database. The most commonly used SQL command is SELECT, and it falls in this category.
    Data Control Language (DCL): used to manage database security and user’s access to data. These commands fall into the realm of Database Administrators. Some examples are GRANT and REVOKE.
    Transaction Control Commands: used for managing groups of statements that must execute as a unit or not execute at all. Examples are COMMIT and ROLLBACK.

    As a developer, you’ll need to get familiar with DDL and become proficient using DML and DQL. This lesson will cover only DML and DQL commands.




    The four SQL operations covered in this section will allow a user to query, insert, and modify a database table.
    Query
    A query is a SQL statement used to retrieve data from a database. The command used to write queries is SELECT, and it is one of the most commonly used SQL commands.
    The basic syntax for a SELECT statement is this:
    select <selection> from <table name>;

To see all the fields on a table, we can use a `*` as the `selection`.

    select * from employees;

The preceding statement would show all the records and all the columns for each record in the `employees` table.

To pick the fields we want to see, we use a comma-separated list:

    select first_name, last_name, salary from employees;

The return of that statement would hold all records from the listed fields.

We can extend the `SELECT` command’s capabilities using `clauses` for things like filtering, sorting, pagination, and more.

It is possible to query multiple tables in a single query. But, in this section, we only perform queries on a single table. We will cover performing queries on multiple tables in another section.

### Insert

To **insert** new data into a table, we’ll use the `INSERT` command. The basic syntax for an `INSERT` statement is this:

    insert into <table name> (<selection>) values (<values>)

Using this formula, we can specify which values will be inserted into which fields like so:

    insert into Customers (Country, CustomerName, ContactName, Address, City, PostalCode)
    values ('USA', 'WebDev School', 'Austen Allred', '1 WebDev Court', 'Provo', '84601');

### Modify

**Modifying** a database consists of updating and removing records. For these operations, we’ll use `UPDATE` and `DELETE` commands, respectively.

The basic syntax for an `UPDATE` statement is:

    update <table name> set <field> = <value> where <condition>;

The basic syntax for a `DELETE` statement is:

    delete from <table name> where <condition>;

When querying a database, the default result will be every entry in the given table. However, often, we are looking for a specific record or a set of records that meets certain criteria.

A `WHERE` clause can help in both cases.

Here’s an example where we might only want to find customers living in Berlin.

    select City, CustomerName, ContactName
    from Customers
    where City = 'Berlin'

We can also chain together `WHERE` clauses using `OR` and `AND` to limit our results further.

The following query includes only records that match both criteria.

    select City, CustomerName, ContactName
    from Customers
    where Country = 'France' and City = 'Paris'

And this query includes records that match either criteria.

    select City, CustomerName, ContactName
    from Customers
    where Country = 'France' or City = 'Paris'

These operators can be combined and grouped with parentheses to add complex selection logic. They behave similarly to what you’re used to in programming languages.

You can read more about SQLite operators from <a href="https://www.w3resource.com/sqlite/operators.php" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">w3resource (Links to an external site.)</a>.

To select a single record, we can use a `WHERE` statement with a uniquely identifying field, like an id:

    select * from Customers
    where CustomerId=3;

Other comparison operators also work in `WHERE` conditions, such as `>`, `<`, `<=`, and `>=`.

    select * from employees where salary >= 50000

### Ordering results using the ORDER BY clause

Query results are shown in the same order the data was inserted. To control how the data is sorted, we can use the `ORDER BY` clause. Let’s see an example.

    -- sorts the results first by salary in descending order, then by the last name in ascending order
    select * from employees order by salary desc, last_name;

We can pass a list of field names to `order by` and optionally choose `asc` or `desc` for the sort direction. The default is `asc`, so it doesn’t need to be specified.

Some SQL engines also support using field abbreviations when sorting.

    select name, salary, department from employees order by 3, 2 desc;

In this case, the results are sorted by the department in ascending order first and then by salary in descending order. The numbers refer to the fields’ position in the *selection* portion of the query, so `1` would be *name*, `2` would be *salary*, and so on.

Note that the `WHERE` clause should come after the `FROM` clause. The `ORDER BY` clause always goes last.

    select * from employees where salary > 50000 order by last_name;

### Limiting results using the LIMIT clause

When we wish to see only a limited number of records, we can use a `LIMIT` clause.

The following returns the first ten records in the products table:

    select * from products
    limit 10

`LIMIT` clauses are often used in conjunction with `ORDER BY`. The following shows us the five cheapest products:

    select * from products
    order by price desc
    limit 5

### Inserting data using INSERT

An insert statement adds a new record to the database. All non-null fields must be listed out in the same order as their values. Some fields, like ids and timestamps, may be auto-generated and do not need to be included in an `INSERT` statement.

    -- we can add fields in any order; the values need to be in the same ordinal position
    -- the id will be assigned automatically
      insert into Customers (Country, CustomerName, ContactName, Address, City, PostalCode)
      values ('USA', 'WebDev School', 'Austen Allred', '1 WebDev Court', 'Provo', '84601');

The values in an insert statement must not violate any restrictions and constraints that the database has in place, such as expected datatypes. We will learn more about constraints and schema design in a later section.

### Modifying recording using UPDATE

When modifying a record, we identify a single record or a set of records to update using a `WHERE` clause. Then we can set the new value(s) in place.

    update Customers
    set City = 'Silicon Valley', Country = 'USA'
    where CustomerName = 'WebDev School'

Technically the `WHERE` clause is not required, but leaving it off would result in every record within the table receiving the update.

### Removing records using DELETE

When removing a record or set of records, we need only identify which record(s) to remove using a `WHERE` clause:

    delete from Customers
    where CustomerName = 'WebDev School`;

Once again, the `WHERE` clause is not required, but leaving it off would remove every record in the table, so it’s essential.

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*9xpwm_56lgvHkFTKsmoMqg.gif" class="graf-image" /></figure>Raw SQL is a critical baseline skill. However, Node developers generally use an **Object Relational Mapper (ORM)** or **query builder** to write database commands in a backend codebase. Both **ORMs** and **query builders** are JavaScript libraries that allow us to interface with the database using a JavaScript version of the SQL language.

For example, instead of a raw SQL `SELECT`:

    SELECT * FROM users;

We could use a query builder to write the same logic in JavaScript:

    db.select('*').from('users');

**Query builders** are lightweight and easy to get off the ground, whereas **ORMs** use an object-oriented model and provide more heavy lifting within their rigid structure.

We will use a **query builder** called <a href="https://knexjs.org/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">knex.js (Links to an external site.)</a>.

### 

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*9xpwm_56lgvHkFTKsmoMqg.gif" class="graf-image" /></figure>### Knex Setup

To use Knex in a repository, we’ll need to add two libraries:

    npm install knex sqlite3

`knex` is our query builder library, and `sqlite3` allows us to interface with a `sqlite` database. We’ll learn more about `sqlite` and other **database management systems** in the following module. For now, know that you need both libraries.

Next, we use Knex to set up a config file:

    const knex = require('knex');
    const config = {
    client: 'sqlite3',
    connection: {
    filename: './data/posts.db3',
    },
    useNullAsDefault: true,
    };
    module.exports = knex(config);
    To use the query builder elsewhere in our code, we need to call knex and pass in a config object. We’ll be discussing Knex configuration more in a future module. Still, we only need the client, connection, and useNullAsDefault keys as shown above. The filename should point towards the pre-existing database file, which can be recognized by the .db3 extension.
    GOTCHA: The file path to the database should be with respect to the root of the repo, not the configuration file itself.
    Once Knex is configured, we can import the above config file anywhere in our codebase to access the database.
    const db = require('../data/db-config.js);

The `db` object provides methods that allow us to begin building queries.

### SELECT using Knex

In Knex, the equivalent of `SELECT * FROM users` is:

    db.select('*').from('users');

There’s a simpler way to write the same command:

    db('users');

Using this, we could write a `GET` endpoint.

    router.get('/api/users', (req, res) => {
      db('users')
      .then(users => {
        res.json(users);
      })
      .catch (err => {
        res.status(500).json({ message: 'Failed to get users' });
      });
    });

**NOTE**: All Knex queries return promises.

Knex also allows for a where clause. In Knex, we could write `SELECT * FROM users WHERE id=1` as

    db('users').where({ id: 1 });

This method will resolve to an array containing a single entry like so: `[{ id: 1, name: 'bill'         }]`.

Using this, we might add a `GET` endpoint where a specific user:

    server.get('api/users/:id', (req, res) => {
      const { id } = req.params;
    db('users').where({ id })

    .then(users => {

    // we must check the length to find our if our user exists

    if (users.length) {

    res.json(users);

    } else {

    res.status(404).json({ message: 'Could not find user with given id.' })

    })

    .catch (err => {

    res.status(500).json({ message: 'Failed to get user' });

    });

    });
    INSERT using Knex
    In Knex, the equivalent of INSERT INTO users (name, age) VALUES ('Eva',                   32) is:
    db('users').insert({ name: 'Eva', age: 32 });

The insert method in Knex will resolve to an array containing the newly created id for that user like so: `[3]`.

### UPDATE using Knex

In knex, the equivalent of `UPDATE users SET name='Ava', age=33 WHERE id=3;` is:

    db('users').where({ id: 3 })
    .update({name: 'Ava', age: 33 });

Note that the `where` method comes before `update`, unlike in SQL.

Update will resolve to a count of rows updated.

### DELETE using Knex

In Knex, the equivalent of `DELETE FROM users WHERE age=33;` is:

    db('users').where({ age: 33}).del();

Once again, the `where` must come before the `del`. This method will resolve to a count of records removed.

### Here’s a small project you can practice with.

SQLlite Studio is an application that allows us to create, open, view, and modify SQLite databases. To fully understand what SQLite Studio is and how it works, we must also understand the concept of the Database Management Systems (DBMS).

### What is a DBMS?

To manage digital databases we use specialized software called **D**ata**B**ase **M**anagement **S**ystems (DBMS). These systems typically run on servers and are managed by **D**ata**B**ase **A**dministrators (DBAs).

In less technical terms, we need a type of software that will allow us to create, access, and generally manage our databases. In the world of relational databases, we specifically use Relational Database Mangement Systems (RDBMs). Some examples are Postgres, SQLite, MySQL, and Oracle.

Choosing a DBMS determines everything from how you set up your database, to where and how the data is stored, to what SQL commands you can use. Most systems share the core of the SQL language that you’ve already learned.

In other words, you can expect `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, `INSERT`, `WHERE` , and the like to be the same across all DBMSs, but the subtleties of the language may vary.

### What is SQLite?

**SQLite** is the DBMS, as the name suggests, it is a more lightweight system and thus easier to get set up than some others.

SQLite allows us to store databases as single files. SQLite projects have a `.db3` extension. That is the database.

SQLite is *not a database* (like relational, graph, or document are databases) but rather *a database management system*.

### Opening an existing database in SQLite Studio

One useful visual interface we might use with a SQLite database is called **SQLite Studio**. <a href="https://sqlitestudio.pl/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">Install SQLITE Studio here. (Links to an external site.)</a>

Once installed, we can use SQLite Studio to open any `.db3` file from a previous lesson. We may view the tables, view the data, and even make changes to the database.

For a more detailed look at SQLite Studio, follow along in the video above.

### 

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*9xpwm_56lgvHkFTKsmoMqg.gif" class="graf-image" /></figure>A **database schema** is the shape of our database. It defines what tables we’ll have, which columns should exist within the tables and any restrictions on each column.

A well-designed database schema keeps the data well organized and can help ensure high-quality data.

Note that while schema design is usually left to Database Administrators (DBAs), understanding schema helps when designing APIs and database logic. And in a smaller team, this step may fall on the developer.

### 

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*9xpwm_56lgvHkFTKsmoMqg.gif" class="graf-image" /></figure>For a look at schema design in SQLite Studio, follow along in the video above.

When designing a single table, we need to ask three things:

-   <span id="2e1a">What fields (or columns) are present?</span>
-   <span id="52e7">What type of data do we expect for each field?</span>
-   <span id="8aff">Are there other restrictions needed for each column?</span>

Looking at the following schema diagram for an `accounts` table, we can the answer to each other those questions:

<a href="https://www.notion.so/9790405dda624818822293a383eec2d2" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">Untitled</a>

### Table Fields

Choosing which fields to include in a table is relatively straight forward. What information needs to be tracked regarding this resource? In the real world, this is determined by the intended use of the product or app.

However, this is one requirement every table should satisfy: a **primary key**. A primary key is a way to identify each entry in the database uniquely. It is most often represented as a auto-incrementing integer called `id` or `[tablename]Id`.

### Datatypes

Each field must also have a specified datatype. The datatype available depends on our DBMS. Some supported datatype in SQLite include:

-   <span id="92fb">**Null:** Missing or unknown information.</span>
-   <span id="32ef">**Integer:** Whole numbers.</span>
-   <span id="181d">**Real:** Any number, including decimals.</span>
-   <span id="ebce">**Text:** Character data.</span>
-   <span id="c00e">**Blob:** a large binary object that can be used to store miscellaneous data.</span>

Any data inserted into the table must match the datatypes determined in schema design.

### Constraints

Beyond datatypes, we may add additional **constraints** on each field. Some examples include:

-   <span id="14ca">**Not Null:** The field cannot be left empty</span>
-   <span id="b533">**Unique:** No two records can have the same value in this field</span>
-   <span id="f0c4">**Primary key:** — Indicates this field is the primary key. Both the not null and unique constraints will be enforced.</span>
-   <span id="f116">**Default:** — Sets a default value if none is provided.</span>

As with data types, any data that does not satisfy the schema constraints will be rejected from the database.

### 

### 

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*9xpwm_56lgvHkFTKsmoMqg.gif" class="graf-image" /></figure>### Multi-Table Design

Another critical component of schema design is to understand how different tables relate to each other. This will be covered in later lesson.

Knex provides a **schema builder**, which allows us to write code to design our database schema. However, beyond thinking about columns and constraints, we must also consider updates.

When a schema needs to be updated, a developer must feel confident that the changes go into effect everywhere. This means schema updates on the developer’s local machine, on any testing or staging versions, on the production database, and then on any other developer’s local machines. This is where **migrations** come into play.

A `database migration` describes changes made to the structure of a database. Migrations include things like adding new objects, adding new tables, and modifying existing objects or tables.

### 

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*9xpwm_56lgvHkFTKsmoMqg.gif" class="graf-image" /></figure>### Knex Cli

To use migrations (and to make Knex setup easier), we need to use **knex cli**. Install knex globally with `npm install -g knex`.

This allows you to use Knex commands within any repo that has `knex` as a local dependency. If you have any issues with this global install, you can use the `npx knex` command instead.

### Initializing Knex

To start, add the `knex` and `sqlite3` libraries to your repository.

`npm install knex sqlite3`

We’ve seen how to use manually create a config object to get started with Knex, but the best practice is to use the following command:

    knex init

Or, if Knex isn’t globally installed:

    npx knex init

This command will generate a file in your root folder called `knexfile.js`. It will be auto populated with three config objects, based on different environments. We can delete all except for the development object.

    module.exports = {
    development: {
    client: 'sqlite3',
    connection: {
    filename: './dev.sqlite3'
    }
    }
    };
    We’ll need to update the location (or desired location) of the database as well as add the useNullAsDefault option. The latter option prevents crashes when working with sqlite3.
    module.exports = {
    development: {
    // our DBMS driver
    client: 'sqlite3',
    // the location of our db
    connection: {
    filename: './data/database_file.db3',
    },
    // necessary when using sqlite3
    useNullAsDefault: true
    }
    };
    Now, wherever we configure our database, we may use the following syntax instead of hardcoding in a config object.
    const knex = require('knex');
    const config = require('../knexfile.js');
    // we must select the development object from our knexfile
    const db = knex(config.development);
    // export for use in codebase

    module.exports = db;
    Knex Migrations
    Once our knexfile is set up, we can begin creating migrations. Though it’s not required, we are going to add an addition option to the config object to specify a directory for the migration files.
    development: {
        client: 'sqlite3',
        connection: {
          filename: './data/produce.db3',
        },
        useNullAsDefault: true,
        // generates migration files in a data/migrations/ folder
        migrations: {
          directory: './data/migrations'
        }
      }

We can generate a new migration with the following command:

`knex migrate:make [migration-name]`

If we needed to create an accounts table, we might run:

`knex migrate:make create-accounts`

Note that inside `data/migrations/` a new file has appeared. Migrations have a timestamp in their filenames automatically. Wither you like this or not, **do not edit migration names.**

The migration file should have both an `up` and a `down` function. Within the `up` function, we write the ended database changes. Within the `down` function, we write the code to undo the `up` functions. This allows us to undo any changes made to the schema if necessary.

    exports.up = function(knex, Promise) {
      // don't forget the return statement
      return knex.schema.createTable('accounts', tbl => {
        // creates a primary key called id
        tbl.increments();
        // creates a text field called name which is both required and unique
        tbl.text('name', 128).unique().notNullable();
        // creates a numeric field called budget which is required
        tbl.decimal('budget').notNullable();
      });
    };
    exports.down = function(knex, Promise) {

    // drops the entire table

    return knex.schema.dropTableIfExists('accounts');

    };
    References for these methods are found in the schema builder section of the Knex docs (Links to an external site.).
    At this point, the table is not yet created. To run this (and any other) migrations, use the command:
    knex migrate:latest
    Note if the database does not exist, this command will auto-generate one. We can use SQLite Studio to confirm that the accounts table has been created.
    Changes and Rollbacks
    If later down the road, we realize you need to update your schema, you shouldn’t edit the migration file. Instead, you will want to create a new migration with the command:
    knex migrate:make accounts-schema-update
    Once we’ve written our updates into this file we save and close with:
    knex migrate:latest
    If we migrate our database and then quickly realize something isn’t right, we can edit the migration file. However, first, we need to rolllback (or undo) our last migration with:
    knex migrate:rollback
    Finally, we are free to rerun that file with knex migrate latest.
    NOTE: A rollback should not be used to edit an old migration file once that file has accepted into a main branch. However, an entire team may use a rollback to return to a previous version of a database.
    Overview
    Knex provides a schema builder, which allows us to write code to design our database schema. However, beyond thinking about columns and constraints, we must also consider updates.
    When a schema needs to be updated, a developer must feel confident that the changes go into effect everywhere.

    Knex Cli
    To use migrations (and to make Knex setup easier), we need to use knex cli. Install knex globally with npm install -g knex.
    This allows you to use Knex commands within any repo that has knex as a local dependency. If you have any issues with this global install, you can use the npx knex command instead.
    Initializing Knex
    To start, add the knex and sqlite3 libraries to your repository.
    npm install knex sqlite3
    We’ve seen how to use manually create a config object to get started with Knex, but the best practice is to use the following command:

    }
    };
    We’ll need to update the location (or desired location) of the database as well as add the useNullAsDefault option. The latter option prevents crashes when working with sqlite3.
    module.exports = {
    development: {
    // our DBMS driver
    client: 'sqlite3',
    // the location of our db
    connection: {
    filename: './data/database_file.db3',
    },
    // necessary when using sqlite3
    useNullAsDefault: true
    }
    };
    Now, wherever we configure our database, we may use the following syntax instead of hardcoding in a config object.
    const knex = require('knex');
    const config = require('../knexfile.js');
    // we must select the development object from our knexfile
    const db = knex(config.development);
    // export for use in codebase

    module.exports = db;
    Knex Migrations
    Once our knexfile is set up, we can begin creating migrations. Though it’s not required, we are going to add an addition option to the config object to specify a directory for the migration files.
    development: {
        client: 'sqlite3',
        connection: {
          filename: './data/produce.db3',
        },
        useNullAsDefault: true,
        // generates migration files in a data/migrations/ folder
        migrations: {
          directory: './data/migrations'
        }
      }

We can generate a new migration with the following command:

`knex migrate:make [migration-name]`

If we needed to create an accounts table, we might run:

`knex migrate:make create-accounts`

Note that inside `data/migrations/` a new file has appeared. Migrations have a timestamp in their filenames automatically. Wither you like this or not, **do not edit migration names.**

The migration file should have both an `up` and a `down` function. Within the `up` function, we write the ended database changes. Within the `down` function, we write the code to undo the `up` functions. This allows us to undo any changes made to the schema if necessary.

    exports.up = function(knex, Promise) {
      // don't forget the return statement
      return knex.schema.createTable('accounts', tbl => {
        // creates a primary key called id
        tbl.increments();
        // creates a text field called name which is both required and unique
        tbl.text('name', 128).unique().notNullable();
        // creates a numeric field called budget which is required
        tbl.decimal('budget').notNullable();
      });
    };
    exports.down = function(knex, Promise) {

    // drops the entire table

    return knex.schema.dropTableIfExists('accounts');

    };
    References for these methods are found in the schema builder section of the Knex docs (Links to an external site.).
    At this point, the table is not yet created. To run this (and any other) migrations, use the command:
    knex migrate:latest
    Note if the database does not exist, this command will auto-generate one. We can use SQLite Studio to confirm that the accounts table has been created.
    Changes and Rollbacks
    If later down the road, we realize you need to update your schema, you shouldn’t edit the migration file. Instead, you will want to create a new migration with the command:
    knex migrate:make accounts-schema-update
    Once we’ve written our updates into this file we save and close with:
    knex migrate:latest
    If we migrate our database and then quickly realize something isn’t right, we can edit the migration file. However, first, we need to rolllback (or undo) our last migration with:
    knex migrate:rollback
    Finally, we are free to rerun that file with knex migrate latest.
    NOTE: A rollback should not be used to edit an old migration file once that file has accepted into a main branch. However, an entire team may use a rollback to return to a previous version of a database.
    Overview
    Often we want to pre-populate our database with sample data for testing. Seeds allow us to add and reset sample data easily.
    Follow Along
    The Knex command-line tool offers a way to seed our database; in other words, pre-populate our tables.
    Similarly to migrations, we want to customize where our seed files are generated using our knexfile
    development: {
        client: 'sqlite3',
        connection: {
          filename: './data/produce.db3',
        },
        useNullAsDefault: true,
        // generates migration files in a data/migrations/ folder
        migrations: {
          directory: './data/migrations'
        },
        seeds: {
          directory: './data/seeds'
        }
      }

To create a seed run: `knex seed:make 001-seedName`

Numbering is a good idea because Knex doesn’t attach a timestamp to the name like migrate does. Adding numbers to the file name, we can control the order in which they run.

We want to create seeds for our accounts table:

`knex seed:make 001-accounts`

A file will appear in the designated seed folder.

    exports.seed = function(knex, Promise) {
      // we want to remove all data before seeding
      // truncate will reset the primary key each time
      return knex('accounts').truncate()
        .then(function () {
          // add data into insert
          return knex('accounts').insert([
            { name: 'Stephenson', budget: 10000 },
            { name: 'Gordon & Gale', budget: 40400 },
          ]);
        });
    };

Run the seed files by typing:

`knex seed:run`

You can now use SQLite Studio to confirm that the accounts table has two entries.

**Foreign keys** are a type of table field used for creating links between tables. Like **primary keys**, they are most often integers that identify (rather than store) data. However, whereas a primary key is used to id rows in a table, foreign keys are used to connect a record in one table to a record in a second table.

### 

Consider the following `farms` and `ranchers` tables.

<a href="https://www.notion.so/5b20c5e233dd4a70a33d6ab2c2e1c8bb" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">Untitled</a>

<a href="https://www.notion.so/0b0a909c24a9474fb9df80938546f12a" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">Untitled</a>

The `farm_id` in the `ranchers` table is an example of a `foreign key`. Each entry in the `farm_id` (foreign key) column corresponds to an `id` (primary key) in the `farms` table. This allows us to track which farm each rancher belongs to while keeping the tables normalized.

If we could only see the `ranchers` table, we would know that John, Jane, and Jen all work together and that Jim and Jay also work together. However, to know where any of them work, we would need to look at the `farms` table.

Now that we understand the basics of querying data from a single table, let’s move on to selecting data from multiple tables using JOIN operations.

### Overview

We can use a `JOIN` to combine query data from multiple tables using a single `SELECT` statement.

There are different types of joins; some are listed below:

-   <span id="d886">inner joins.</span>
-   <span id="43f5">outer joins.</span>
-   <span id="882e">left joins.</span>
-   <span id="ad86">right joins.</span>
-   <span id="4d8b">cross joins.</span>
-   <span id="eb21">non-equality joins.</span>
-   <span id="fc6a">self joins.</span>

Using `joins` requires that the two tables of interest contain at least one field with shared information. For example, if a *departments* table has an *id* field, and an employee table has a *department\_id* field, and the values that exist in the *id* column of the *departments* table live in the *department\_id* field of the employee table, we can use those fields to join both tables like so:

    select * from employees
    join departments on employees.department_id = departments.id

This query will return the data from both tables for every instance where the `ON` condition is true. If there are employees with no value for department*id or where the value stored in the field does not correspond to an existing id in the* departments *table, then that record will NOT be returned. In a similar fashion, any records from the* departments *table that don’t have an employee associated with them will also be omitted from the results. Basically, if the* id\* does not show as the value of department\_id for an employee, it won’t be able to join.

We can shorten the condition by giving the table names an alias. This is a common practice. Below is the same example using aliases, picking which fields to return and sorting the results:

    select d.id, d.name, e.id, e.first_name, e.last_name, e.salary
    from employees as e
    join departments as d
      on e.department_id = d.id
    order by d.name, e.last_name

Notice that we can take advantage of white space and indentation to make queries more readable.

There are several ways of writing joins, but the one shown here should work on all database management systems and avoid some pitfalls, so we recommend it.

The syntax for performing a similar join using Knex is as follows:

    db('employees as e')
      .join('departments as d', 'e.department_id', 'd.id')
      .select('d.id', 'd.name', 'e.first_name', 'e.last_name', 'e.salary')

A good explanation of how the different types of joins can be seen <a href="https://www.w3resource.com/sql/joins/sql-joins.php" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">in this article from w3resource.com (Links to an external site.)</a>.

### What is SQL Joins?

An SQL JOIN clause combines rows from two or more tables. It creates a set of rows in a temporary table.

### How to Join two tables in SQL?

A JOIN works on two or more tables if they have at least one common field and have a relationship between them.

JOIN keeps the base tables (structure and data) unchanged.

### Join vs. Subquery

-   <span id="6fdc">JOINs are faster than a subquery and it is very rare that the opposite.</span>
-   <span id="c648">In JOINs the RDBMS calculates an execution plan, that can predict, what data should be loaded and how much it will take to processed and as a result this process save some times, unlike the subquery there is no pre-process calculation and run all the queries and load all their data to do the processing.</span>
-   <span id="d59c">A JOIN is checked conditions first and then put it into table and displays; where as a subquery take separate temp table internally and checking condition.</span>
-   <span id="08ff">When joins are using, there should be connection between two or more than two tables and each table has a relation with other while subquery means query inside another query, has no need to relation, it works on columns and conditions.</span>

### SQL JOINS: EQUI JOIN and NON EQUI JOIN

The are two types of SQL JOINS — EQUI JOIN and NON EQUI JOIN

1.  <span id="2bb1">SQL EQUI JOIN :</span>

The SQL EQUI JOIN is a simple SQL join uses the equal sign(=) as the comparison operator for the condition. It has two types — SQL Outer join and SQL Inner join.

1.  <span id="a9be">SQL NON EQUI JOIN :</span>

The **SQL NON EQUI JOIN** is a join uses comparison operator other than the equal sign like &gt;, &lt;, &gt;=, &lt;= with the condition.

**SQL EQUI JOIN : INNER JOIN and OUTER JOIN**

The SQL EQUI JOIN can be classified into two types — INNER JOIN and OUTER JOIN

1.  <span id="cf44">SQL INNER JOIN</span>

This type of EQUI JOIN returns all rows from tables where the key record of one table is equal to the key records of another table.

1.  <span id="22a6">SQL OUTER JOIN</span>

This type of EQUI JOIN returns all rows from one table and only those rows from the secondary table where the joined condition is satisfying i.e. the columns are equal in both tables.

In order to perform a JOIN query, the required information we need are:

**a)** The name of the tables**b)** Name of the columns of two or more tables, based on which a condition will perform.

**Syntax:**

    FROM table1
    join_type table2
    [ON (join_condition)]

**Parameters:**

**Pictorial Presentation of SQL Joins:**

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*2DcsnJXF_FOGhUtL.gif" class="graf-image" /></figure>**Example:**

**Sample table: company**

**Sample table: foods**

To join two tables ‘company’ and ‘foods’, the following SQL statement can be used :

**SQL Code:**

    SELECT  company.company_id,company.company_name,
    foods.item_id,foods.item_name
    FROM company,foods;

Copy

Output:

### Overview

While we can write database code directly into our endpoints, best practices dictate that all database logic exists in separate, modular methods. These files containing database access helpers are often called **models**

### Follow Along

To handle CRUD operations for a single resource, we would want to create a **model** (or database access file) containing the following methods:

    function find() {
    }
    function findById(id) {
    }
    function add(user) {
    }
    function update(changes, id) {
    }
    function remove(id) {

    }
    Each of these functions would use Knex logic to perform the necessary database operation.
    function find() {
      return db('users');
    }

For each method, we can choose what value to return. For example, we may prefer `findById()` to return a single `user` object rather than an array.

    function findById(id) {
    // first() returns the first entry in the db matching the query
      return db('users').where({ id }).first();
    }

We can also use existing methods like `findById()` to help `add()` return the new user (instead of just the id).

    function add(user) {
      db('users').insert(user)
        .then(ids => {
          return findById(ids[0]);
        });
    }

Once all methods are written as desired, we can export them like so:

    module.exports = {
      find,
      findById,
      add,
      update,
      delete,
    }

…and use the helpers in our endpoints

    const User = require('./user-model.js');
    router.get('/', (req, res) => {

    User.find()

    .then(users => {

    res.json(users);

    })

    .catch(&nbsp;err => {});

    });
    There should no be knex code in the endpoints themselves.






    Normalization is the process of designing or refactoring database tables for maximum consistency and minimum redundancy.
    With objects, we’re used to denormalized data, stored with ease of use and speed in mind. Non-normalized tables are considered ineffective in relational databases.

    Data normalization is a deep topic in database design. To begin thinking about it, we’ll explore a few basic guidelines and some data examples that violate these rules.
    Normalization Guidelines

    Each record has a primary key.


    No fields are repeated.


    All fields relate directly to the key data.


    Each field entry contains a single data point.


    There are no redundant entries.

    Denormalized Data
    Untitled
    This table has two issues. There is no proper id field (as multiple farms may have the same name), and multiple fields are representing the same type of data: animals.
    Untitled
    While we have now eliminated the first two issues, we now have multiple entries in one field, separated by commas. This isn’t good either, as its another example of denormalization. There is no “array” data type in a relational database, so each field must contain only one data point.
    Untitled
    Now we’ve solved the multiple fields issue, but we created repeating data (the farm field), which is also an example of denormalization. As well, we can see that if we were tracking additional ranch information (such as annual revenue), that field is only vaguely related to the animal information.
    When these issues begin arising in your schema design, it means that you should separate information into two or more tables.
    Anomalies
    Obeying the above guidelines prevent anomalies in your database when inserting, updating, or deleting. For example, imagine if the revenue of Beech Ranch changed. With our denormalized schema, it may get updated in some records but not others:
    Untitled
    Similarly, if Beech Ranch shut down, there would be three (if not more) records that needed to be deleted to remove a single farm.
    Thus a denormalized table opens the door for contradictory, confusing, and unusable data.

    What issues does the following table have?
    Untitled

    There are three types of relationships:

    One to one.


    One to many.


    Many to many.

    Determining how data is related can provide a set of guidelines for table representation and guides the use of foreign keys to connect said tables.

    One to One Relationships
    Imagine we are storing the financial projections for a series of farms.
    We may wish to attach fields like farm name, address, description, projected revenue, and projected expenses. We could divide these fields into two categories: information related to the farm directly (name, address, description) and information related to the financial projections (revenue, expenses).
    We would say that farms and projections have a one-to-one relationship. This is to say that every farm has exactly one projection, and every project corresponds to exactly one farm.
    This data can be represented in two tables: farms and projections
    Untitled
    Untitled
    The farm_id is the foreign key that links farms and projections together.
    Notes about one-to-one relationships:

    The foreign key should always have a unique constraint to prevent duplicate entries. In the example above, we wouldn’t want to allow multiple projections records for one farm.
    The foreign key can be in either table. For example, we may have had a projection_id in the farms table instead. A good rule of thumb is to put the foreign key in whichever table is more auxiliary to the other.
    You can represent one-to-one data in a single table without creating anomalies. However, it is sometimes prudent to use two tables as shown above to keep separate concerns in separate tables.

    One to Many Relationships
    Now imagine, we are storing the full-time ranchers employed at each farm. In this case, each rancher would only work at one farm however, each farm may have multiple ranchers.
    This is called a one-to-many relationship.
    This is the most common type of relationship between entities. Some other examples:

    One customer can have many orders.
    One user can have many posts.
    One post can have many comments.

    Manage this type of relationship by adding a foreign key on the “many” table of the relationship that points to the primary key on the “one” table. Consider the farms and ranchers tables.
    Untitled
    Untitled
    In a many-to-many relationship, the foreign key (in this case farm_id) should not be unique.
    Many to Many Relationships
    If we want to track animals on a farm as well, we must explore the many-to-many relationship. A farm has multiple animals, and multiple of each type of animal is present at multiple different farms.
    Some other examples:

    an order can have many products and the same product will appear in many orders.
    a book can have more than one author, and an author can write more than one book.

    To model this relationship, we need to introduce an intermediary table that holds foreign keys that reference the primary key on the related tables. We now have a farms, animals, and farm_animals table.
    Untitled
    Untitled
    Untitled
    While each foreign key on the intermediary table is not unique, the combinations of keys should be unique.




    The Knex query builder library also allows us to create multi-table schemas include foreign keys. However, there are a few extra things to keep in mind when designing a multi-table schema, such as using the correct order when creating tables, dropping tables, seeding data, and removing data.
    We have to consider the way that delete and updates through our API will impact related data.

    Foreign Key Setup
    In Knex, foreign key restrictions don’t automatically work. Whenever using foreign keys in your schema, add the following code to your knexfile. This will prevent users from entering bad data into a foreign key column.
    development: {
      client: 'sqlite3',
      useNullAsDefault: true,
      connection: {
        filename: './data/database.db3',
      },
      // needed when using foreign keys
      pool: {
        afterCreate: (conn, done) => {
          // runs after a connection is made to the sqlite engine
          conn.run('PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON', done); // turn on FK enforcement
        },
      },
    },

### Migrations

Let’s look at how we might track our `farms` and `ranchers` using Knex. In our migration file’s `up` function, we would want to create two tables:

    exports.up = function(knex, Promise) {
      return knex.schema
        .createTable('farms', tbl => {
          tbl.increments();
          tbl.string('farm_name', 128)
            .notNullable();
        })
        // we can chain together createTable
        .createTable('ranchers', tbl => {
          tbl.increments();
          tbl.string('rancher_name', 128);
          tbl.integer('farm_id')
            // forces integer to be positive
            .unsigned()
            .notNullable()
            .references('id')
            // this table must exist already
            .inTable('farms')
        })
    };

Note that the foreign key can only be created *after* the reference table.

In the down function, the opposite is true. We always want to drop a table with a foreign key *before* dropping the table it references.

    exports.down = function(knex, Promise) {
      // drop in the opposite order
      return knex.schema
        .dropTableIfExists('ranchers')
        .dropTableIfExists('farms')
    };

In the case of a many-to-many relationship, the syntax for creating an intermediary table is identical, except for one additional piece. We need a way to make sure our combination of foreign keys is unique.

    .createTable('farm_animals', tbl => {
      tbl.integer('farm_id')
        .unsigned()
        .notNullable()
        .references('id')
        // this table must exist already
        .inTable('farms')
      tbl.integer('animal_id')
        .unsigned()
        .notNullable()
        .references('id')
        // this table must exist already
        .inTable('animals')
    // the combination of the two keys becomes our primary key

    // will enforce unique combinations of ids

    tbl.primary(['farm_id', 'animal_id']);

    });
    Seeds
    Order is also a concern when seeding. We want to create seeds in the same order we created our tables. In other words, don’t create a seed with a foreign key, until that reference record exists.
    In our example, make sure to write the 01-farms seed file and then the 02-ranchers seed file.
    However, we run into a problem with truncating our seeds, because we want to truncate 02-ranchers before 01-farms. A library called knex-cleaner provides an easy solution for us.
    Run knex seed:make 00-cleanup and npm install knex-cleaner. Inside the cleanup seed, use the following code.
    const cleaner = require('knex-cleaner');
    exports.seed = function(knex) {

    return cleaner.clean(knex, {

    mode: 'truncate', // resets ids

    ignoreTables: ['knex_migrations', 'knex_migrations_lock'], // don't empty migration tables

    });

    };
    This removes all tables (excluding the two tables that track migrations) in the correct order before any seed files run.
    Cascading
    If a user attempt to delete a record that is referenced by another record (such as attempting to delete Morton Ranch when entries in our ranchers table reference that record), by default, the database will block the action. The same thing can happen when updating a record when a foreign key reference.
    If we want that to override this default, we can delete or update with cascade. With cascade, deleting a record also deletes all referencing records, we can set that up in our schema.
    .createTable('ranchers', tbl => {
        tbl.increments();
        tbl.string('rancher_name', 128);
        tbl.integer('farm_id')
        .unsigned()
        .notNullable()
        .references('id')
        .inTable('farms')
        .onUpdate('CASCADE');
        .onDelete('CASCADE')
    })

    A package.json file already exists with the dependencies. Please run npm install to install those before doing your development and running your tests.

    Do not remove any dependencies already listed in the package.json.
    Running the application
    You can run your application in “dev” mode. The nodemon package is installed

    and runnable from npm run dev.
    Running the tests
    This is “black-box testing”. The tests will only use your Express application.

    It will not make connections to the database or directly test your route

    handlers. They will merely make HTTP requests of your Express app and analyze

    the responses.
    To ease your development, tests will run against your development database

    and not the test database.
    You will be responsible for creating, migrating, and seeding the data in

    your development database.
    Run your tests with npm test. You can run npm test test/test-file-name.js

    to run the tests for a specific part of the assessment.

    Example: To only run the test 01-form-page.js do,

    npm test test/01-form-page.js

    If you get tired of seeing all of the Sequelize failures, you can try running:
    npm test 2> /dev/null

That should redirect the annoying messages into oblivion but leave the  
mocha output available for you to read. This may prevent you from seeing other  
errors, though, so make sure to run it without the `2> /dev/null` if you’re  
trying to get a test to pass and need to see error output.

### App Requirements

These are the requirements for the application. Follow them closely. The tests  
will attempt to read data from your rendered HTML.

Read all of the requirements. Determine the data needed to include in your data  
model.

Please use port 8081 for your Express.js server.

### The database

Create a database user with `CREATEDB` priveleges:

-   <span id="96a3">The login username that you must use is “express\_practice\_app”</span>
-   <span id="6e88">The login password that you must use is “EzB5Dxo2dabnQBF8”</span>

Initialize Sequelize in your assessment and use the following configuration in  
your `config/config.json` file:

    {
      "development": {
        "username": "express_practice_app",
        "password": "EzB5Dxo2dabnQBF8",
        "database": "express_practice_development",
        "host": "127.0.0.1",
        "dialect": "postgres",
        "seederStorage": "sequelize",
        "logging": false
      }
    }

Remove `logging: false` if you want to see SQL output in your terminal when  
running tests with `npm test`.

Create the `development` database with those configurations.

For this assessment, the tests will be using your `development` database  
configuration defined in the `config.json` file. **The tests will not be  
testing your database explicitly, but test specs DO rely on you setting up the  
database AND database constraints properly.**

You will need to generate and run the migrations, models, and seeders. There is  
no need to run `npm test` until after doing this.

### The data model

You will need to store “People” data and “HairColor” data.

Generate a model (and migration) for the “HairColor” model with the attributes:

Attribute nameAttribute typeConstraintscolorstringunique, not nullable

-   <span id="cda4">the “color” column will hold values up to 20 characters in length and  
    will not allow `NULL`s</span>

Generate a model (and migration) for the “Person” model with the attributes:

Attribute nameAttribute typeConstraintsfirstNamestringnot nullablelastNamestringnot nullableageintegerbiographytexthairColorIdintegernot nullable, references HairColors

Configure the migration so that:

-   <span id="7b0d">the “firstName” column will hold values up to 50 characters in length and  
    will not allow `NULL`s</span>
-   <span id="c44e">the “lastName” column will hold values up to 50 characters in length and  
    will not allow `NULL`s</span>
-   <span id="e6f2">the “hairColorId” will not allow `NULL`s and references the “HairColors”  
    table</span>

Create a seeder file for `HairColors`:

    { color: "Auburn", createdAt: '2019-04-12', updatedAt: '2019-04-12'},
    { color: "Black", createdAt: '2019-04-12', updatedAt: '2019-04-12' },
    { color: "Blonde", createdAt: '2019-04-12', updatedAt: '2019-04-12' },
    { color: "Brown", createdAt: '2019-04-12', updatedAt: '2019-04-12' },
    { color: "Other", createdAt: '2019-04-12', updatedAt: '2019-04-12' },
    { color: "Red", createdAt: '2019-04-12', updatedAt: '2019-04-12' },
    { color: "White", createdAt: '2019-04-12', updatedAt: '2019-04-12' },

If you set up the seeder correctly, the `HairColors` table should have the  
following pre-defined data in it:

colorAuburnBlackBlondeBrownOtherRedWhite

**NOTE:** All of the data constraints for this assessment can be handled by the  
database with the `allowNull` and `unique` flags in your migrations. You **do  
not** need to use form validations in this project. They are good to have, in  
real applications, but can require too much time for you to integrate them into  
this project. Again, you **do not** need to use a form validator, just use  
database constraints and let the errors turn into 500 status codes by Express.

Make sure to make the appropriate associations.

After you’ve generated your models, migrations, and seeder files, don’t forget  
to migrate and seed your database with the appropriate Sequelize CLI commands.

### Your main file

You must use the **app.js** file to create and configure your Express  
application. You must store the instance of your Express.js application in a  
variable named “app”. That is what is exported at the bottom of the **app.js**  
file.

Set up your CSRF middleware to use cookies.

### The route “GET /new-person”

This page shows a form in which a visitor can add a new person. The form must  
have

-   <span id="4869">a method of “post”</span>
-   <span id="1861">an action of “/new-person”</span>

In the form, you should have these inputs with the provided name:

Field HTML nameField typeConstraintsDefault valuesfirstNamesingle-line textrequiredlastNamesingle-line textrequiredagenumberbiographymulti-line texthairColorIddropdownrequiredOne of the pre-defined hair colors\_csrfhiddenThe value provided by the CSURF middleware

You should also have a submit button.

Please refer to the screenshot below:

### The route “POST /new-person”

The post handler should validate the data from the HTTP request. If everything  
is fine, then it should create a new person and redirect to the route “/”.

Remember, all of the data constraints for this assessment can be handled by the  
database with the `allowNull` and `unique` flags in your migrations. You **do  
not** need to use form validations in this project. They are good to have, in  
real applications, but can require too much time for you to integrate them into  
this project. Again, you **do not** need to use a form validator, just use  
database constraints and let the errors turn into 500 status codes by Express.

If the data does not pass validation, then no new record should be created. It  
is ok to just let Express return an error code of 500 in this case. **Note**:  
you would not do this in a real application.

### The route “GET /”

When someone accesses your application, they should see a list of people that  
are stored in your database. The list should contain:

-   <span id="8be4">The person’s first name</span>
-   <span id="30c2">The person’s last name</span>
-   <span id="c4ee">The person’s age</span>
-   <span id="392d">A short biography</span>
-   <span id="15a9">Their hair color</span>

Please refer to the screenshot below:

To create a table in a Pug.js template, you’ll use something like the following  
code. You probably already know this, but it’s included for your reference.

    table
      thead
        tr
          th Header 1
          th Header 2
      tbody
        each thing in things
          tr
            td= thing.property1
            td= thing.property2

The tests will use a regular expression to determine if each piece of data is  
wrapped with TD tags. For example, to test for the “Auburn”  
value appearing in the HTML of the page, the tests would use the following  
regular expression.

    <td[^>]*>\s*Auburn\s*</td>

The regular expression will ignore any attributes that you put on the table data  
tag as well as any white space around the entry for the data value.

Again, the styling is not important to the tests.

Front End Behavioral Interview
==============================

Web Developer Job Interview Questions

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Front End Behavioral Interview

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*h1f0wDTq6vj_V8QS.png" class="graf-image" /></figure>### Web Developer Job Interview Questions

### 1. DESCRIBE A WEB DEVELOPMENT PROJECT YOU WORKED ON FROM START TO FINISH. WHAT APPROACH DID YOU TAKE, WHAT CHALLENGES DID YOU FACE, AND HOW WERE YOU SUCCESSFUL?

Tip: Be transparent about what a real web development project looks like for you. Highlight your wins, of course, but don’t shy away from being real about the challenges. Interviewers aren’t looking to hear that you never have setbacks (that’s not realistic). They want to hear how you get past setbacks and ultimately succeed.

### 2. DESCRIBE A PROJECT THAT WENT OFF THE RAILS. WHY DID IT GO WRONG AND HOW DID YOU REACT?

Tip: Similar to the last question, interviewers are looking for honesty here. Sometimes projects go badly, and that’s OK. What’s important is how you respond to failures and learn from them so they don’t happen next time.

### 3. WHICH PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES ARE YOU PROFICIENT IN? ARE THERE ANY LANGUAGES YOU’RE NOT FAMILIAR WITH THAT YOU FEEL LIKE YOU NEED TO LEARN?

Tip: This question is pretty straightforward — -let the interviewer know which languages you’re familiar with and how you use them. Ideally, you’ve scoped out the job beforehand and know that your experience syncs with what the employer needs. At the same time, have some new languages in mind that you’d like to learn. This highlights your willingness to keep growing professionally.

### 4. WHY ARE YOU DRAWN TO WEB DEVELOPMENT?

Tip: It’s a common pitfall to interview for a job and never explicitly say WHY you want to work in this specific field or for this particular employer/company. Even if the question doesn’t get asked, find a way to touch on it during the interview.

### 5. WHAT KIND OF TEAM ENVIRONMENT DO YOU THRIVE IN?

Tip: You may be tempted to say whatever you think the interviewer is looking for, but it’s way better to be honest. If the team you’ll be working with has a work style that’s completely outside of your comfort zone, then this particular job might not be a good fit for you. That being said, most development teams are dynamic and flexible, and if your employer knows what kind of environment suits you best, they can help find a spot on the team that WILL work for you.

### 6. HOW DO YOU KEEP ON TOP OF INDUSTRY NEWS AND TRENDS, AND HOW DO YOU APPLY THIS TO YOUR WORK?

Tip: You DO keep up with industry news, don’t you? If so, simply rattle off your list of favorite news sources and why they’re effective for keeping you in the know. And if tech news is something you’ve overlooked while being in the weeds of learning tech skills, take a few minutes to find a few suitable news blogs and tech Twitter accounts to put in your hip pocket (and be ready to bust them out at your next interview).

### 7. HOW DO YOU COMMUNICATE YOUR PROGRESS TO CLIENTS AND/OR STAKEHOLDERS?

Tip: The gist here is to demonstrate that you understand the importance of keeping clients and stakeholders up to date, and that you have ideas for establishing systems of communication (or that you’re willing to work with systems like Agile or Scrum if they’re used by your employer).

### 8. WHAT DO YOU DO IF A CLIENT OR STAKEHOLDER IS UNHAPPY WITH A PROJECT?

Tip: Having an effective communication strategy with stakeholders doesn’t mean you won’t sometimes receive negative feedback. So how do you respond? Do you get defensive? Shut down? Give up? Or do you find creative ways to accept that feedback and address client or shareholder concerns? Interviewers are looking for candidates who can adapt to and recover from hard times, so either think of a real example that you can share, or develop a client appeasement gameplan that you’ll use when the time comes.

### 9. GIVE ME AN EXAMPLE OF HOW YOU’D DESCRIBE WEB DEVELOPMENT (WHAT IT IS, WHY IT IS IMPORTANT) TO SOMEONE WHO IS COMPLETELY NEW TO TECH.

Tip: As a web developer you’ll find yourself in situations where you need to talk “tech” with non-techies. Making your work make sense to people who have no idea what it is you actually do is a valuable skill. Take off your developer hat for a day and think of some ways to describe web development to someone who doesn’t know Java from JavaScript.

### 10. GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF A WEBSITE OR WEB APPLICATION THAT YOU DON’T LIKE, POINT OUT WHAT’S WRONG WITH IT AND WHAT YOU WOULD CHANGE.

Tip: Interviewers may ask you to provide an example of a website you think is less than stellar, then ask you to describe what you think is lacking and what you’d do to improve it. It’s a good idea to have examples and explanations on hand (as well as examples of sites you think are super effective) going into an interview. Answering this question comprehensively shows interviewers that you aren’t signing on to mindlessly write code — -you understand what makes good sites good and how to make bad sites better.

### 11. WHAT KIND OF MANAGEMENT STYLE DO YOU RESPOND TO BEST?

Tip: This question is another one where you might be tempted to make the interviewer happy. But you know what’s guaranteed to make YOU unhappy? Working for a manager whose style you can’t stand. Be as flexible and as open minded as you can when describing your preferred management style, but if there’s something that’s a complete deal-breaker for you (or that you particularly appreciate), don’t be shy about making it known.

### 12. HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE THE ROLE OF A WEB DEVELOPER? WHAT ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF THE JOB AND WHY?

Tip: Your clear and concise summary of a web developer role shows how you think about the web development process in general, and lets interviewers know what specific developer strengths and interests you bring to the job.

### 13. HOW DO YOU MANAGE YOUR TIME DURING A DEVELOPMENT CYCLE, AND WHAT METHODS DO YOU USE FOR ESTIMATING HOW LONG SPECIFIC DEVELOPMENT TASKS WILL TAKE?

Tip: Managing your time and estimating how long individual tasks will take is critical to your success as a web developer. If you’re already good at time management and estimation, revisit what works for you and build on it ahead of this question. And if your current time management approach isn’t working? Now’s a great time to implement a new system and get the most out of your work day.

### 14. WHAT SOFT SKILLS WILL YOU BRING TO THE JOB, AND HOW DO YOU ENVISION USING THEM?

Tip: Soft skills can be a difference maker. If it’s a choice between a skilled programmer and a skilled programmer who can write well or who has experience with project management, most employers will pick the latter. So have a list of your own soft skills ready, but also have examples of how they’ll be relevant to a web developer job. It’s not enough to say you’re good at written and verbal communication. You need to explain how your excellent written and verbal communication skills will help you relay project details to team members and stakeholders.

### 15. GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF A NON-CODING/WEB DEVELOPMENT PROBLEM THAT YOU’VE SOLVED, AND WHAT YOUR PROBLEM SOLVING PROCESS INVOLVED.

Tip: Yes, you’re interviewing for a web developer job, but remember to look to other experiences in your life for inspiration. Examples like the time you helped improve the ordering system at the cafe you worked at or put together a volunteer fundraising effort to save the music program at your kids’ school all speak to the breadth of your problem solving abilities and experiences.

-   <span id="0232">**­­­­If you were to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?**</span>

Semantic HTML is markup that conveys meaning, not appearance, to search engines to make everything easier to identify.

-   <span id="37b8">**Name two big differences between display: block; and display: inline;.**</span>

block starts on a new line and takes up the full width of the content.  
 inline starts on the same line as previous content, in line with other content, and takes up only the space needed for the content.

· **What are the 4 areas of the box model?**

content, padding, border, margin

· **While using flexbox, what axis does the following property work on: align-items: center?**

cross-axis

· **Explain why git is valuable to a team of developers.**

Allows you to dole out tiny pieces of a large project to many developers who can all work towards the same goal on their own chunks, allows roll back if you make a mistake; version control.

· **What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?**

An adaptive website “adapts” to fit a pre-determined set of screen sizes/devices, and a responsive one changes to fit all devices.

· **Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.**

It means you develop/code the site with mobile in mind first and work your way outward in screen size.

· **What does font-size: 62.5% in the html tag do for us when using rem units?**

This setting makes it so that 1 rem = 10 px for font size, easier to calculate.

· **How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?**

Preprocessing is basically a bunch of functions and variables you can use to store CSS settings in different ways that make it easier to code CSS.

· **What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?**

Favorite is (parametric) mixins; but I don’t have a lot of trouble with preprocessing. What gives me the most trouble is knowing ahead of time what would be good to go in a mixin for a given site.

· **Describe the biggest difference between .forEach & .map.**

forEach iterates over an array item by item, and map calls a function on each array item, but returns another/additional array, unlike forEach.

· **What is the difference between a function and a method?**

Every function is an object. If a value is a function, it is a method. Methods have to be ‘received’ by something; functions do not.

· **What is closure?**

It is code identified elsewhere that we can use later; gives the ability to put functions together. If a variable isn’t defined, a function looks outward for context.

· **Describe the four rules of the ‘this’ keyword.**

1.  Window/global binding — this is the window/console object. ‘use strict’; to prevent window binding.

2.  Implicit binding — when a function is called by a dot, the object preceding the dot is the ‘this’. 80 percent of ‘this’ is from this type of binding.

3.  New binding — points to new object created & returned by constructor function

4.  Explicit binding — whenever call, bind, or apply are used.

· **Why do we need super() in an extended class?**

Super ties the parent to the child.

-   <span id="d57b">**What is the DOM?**</span>

Document object model, the ‘window’ or container that holds all the page’s elements

-   <span id="6172">**What is an event?**</span>

An event is something happening on or to the page, like a mouse click, doubleclick, key up/down, pointer out of element/over element, things like this. There are tons of “events” that javascript can detect.

-   <span id="75c5">**What is an event listener?**</span>

Javascript command that ‘listens’ for an event to happen on the page to a given element and then runs a function when that event happens

-   <span id="157d">**Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?**</span>

A NodeList isn’t a real array, so it won’t have access to array methods such as slice or map.

-   <span id="6934">**What is a component?**</span>

Reusable pieces of code to display info in a consistent repeatable way

· **What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve? Support your answer with concepts introduced in class and from your personal research on the web.**

ReactJS is a library used to build large applications. It’s very good at assisting developers in manipulating the DOM element to create rich user experiences. We need a way to off-load the state/data that our apps use, and React helps us do that.

· **What does it mean to *think* in react?**

It makes you think about how to organize/build apps a little differently because it’s very scalable and allows you to build huge apps. React’s one-way data flow makes everything modular and fast. You can build apps top-down or bottom-up.

· **Describe state.**

Some data we want to display.

· **Describe props.**

Props are like function arguments in JS and attributes in HTML.

· **What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component to state or prop changes?**

Side effects are anything that affects something outside the executed function’s scope like fetching data from an API, a timer, or logging.

· **Explain benefit(s) using client-side routing?**

Answer: It’s much more efficient than the traditional way, because a lot of data isn’t being transmitted unnecessarily.

· **Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?**

Because some companies still use class components and don’t want to switch their millions of dollars’ worth of code over to all functional hooks, and also there’s currently a lot more troubleshooting content out there for classes that isn’t out there for hooks. Also, functional components are better when you don’t need state, presentational components.

· **Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.**

componentDidMount = do the stuff inside this ‘function’ after the component mounted

componentDidUpdate = do the stuff inside this function after the component updated

componentWillUnmount = clean-up in death/unmounting phase

· **What is the purpose of a custom hook?**

allow you to apply non-visual behavior and stateful logic throughout your components by reusing the same hook over and over again

· **Why is it important to test our apps?**

Gets bugs fixed faster, reduces regression risk, makes you consider/work out the edge cases, acts as documentation, acts as safety net when refactoring, makes code more trustworthy

· **What problem does the context API help solve?**

You can store data in a context object instead of prop drilling.

· **In your own words, describe actions, reducers and the store and their role in Redux. What does each piece do? Why is the store known as a ‘single source of truth’ in a redux application?**

Everything that changes within your app is represented by a single JS object called the store. The store contains state for our application. When changes are made to our application state, we never write to our store object but rather clone the state object, modify the clone, and replace the original state with the new copy, never mutating the original object. Reducers are the only place we can update our state. Actions tell our reducers “how” to update the state, and perhaps with what data it should be updated, but only a reducer can actually update the state.

· **What is the difference between Application state and Component state? When would be a good time to use one over the other?**

App state is global, component state is local. Use component state when you have component-specific variables.

· **Describe redux-thunk, what does it allow us to do? How does it change our action-creators?**

Redux Thunk is middleware that provides the ability to handle asynchronous operations inside our Action Creators, because reducers are normally synchronous.

· **What is your favorite state management system you’ve learned and this sprint? Please explain why!**

Redux, because I felt it was easier to understand than the context API.

· **Explain what a token is used for.**

Many services out in the wild require the client (our React app, for example) to provide proof that it’s authenticated with them. The server running these services can issue a JWT (JSON Web Token) as the authentication token, in exchange for correct login credentials.

· **What steps can you take in your web apps to keep your data secure?**

As we build our web apps, we will most likely have some “protected” routes — routes that we only want to render if the user has logged in and been authenticated by our server. The way this normally works is we make a login request, sending the server the user’s username and password. The server will check those credentials against what is in the database, and if it can authenticate the user, it will return a token. Once we have this token, we can add two layers of protection to our app. One with protected routes, the other by sending an authentication header with our API calls (as we learned in the above objective).

· **Describe how web servers work.**

The “world wide web” (which we’ll refer to as “the web”) is just a part of the internet — which is itself a network of interconnected computers. The web is just one way to share data over the internet. It consists of a body of information stored on web servers, ready to be shared across the world. The term “web server” can mean two things:

· a computer that stores the code for a website

· a program that runs on such a computer

The physical computer device that we call a web server is connected to the internet, and stores the code for different websites to be shared across the world at all times. When we load the code for our websites, or web apps, on a server like this, we would say that the server is “hosting” our website/app.

· **Which HTTP methods can be mapped to the CRUD acronym that we use when interfacing with APIs/Servers.**

Create, Read, Update, Delete

· **Mention two parts of Express that you learned about this week.**

Routing/router, Middleware, convenience helpers

· **Describe Middleware?**

array of functions that get executed in the order they are introduced into the server code

· **Describe a Resource?**

o everything is a **resource**.

o each resource is accessible via a **unique URI**.

o resources can have multiple **representations**.

o communication is done over a **stateless** protocol (HTTP).

o management of resources is done via **HTTP methods**.

· **What can the API return to help clients know if a request was successful?**

200 status code/201 status code

· **How can we partition our application into sub-applications?**

By dividing the code up into multiple files and ‘requiring’ them in the main server file.

· **Explain the difference between Relational Databases and SQL.**

SQL is the language used to access a relational database.

· **Why do tables need a primary key?**

To uniquely identify each record/row.

· **What is the name given to a table column that references the primary key on another table.**

Foreign key

· **What do we need in order to have a *many to many* relationship between two tables.**

An **intermediary table** that holds foreign keys that reference the primary key on the related tables.

· **What is the purpose of using *sessions*?**

The purpose is to persist data across requests.

· **What does bcrypt do to help us store passwords in a secure manner?**

o password hashing function.

o implements salting both manual and automatically.

o accumulative hashing rounds.

· **What does bcrypt do to slow down attackers?**

Having an algorithm that hashes the information multiple times (rounds) means an attacker needs to have the hash, know the algorithm used, and how many rounds were used to generate the hash in the first place. So it basically makes it a lot more difficult to get somebody’s password.

· **What are the three parts of the JSON Web Token?**

Header, payload, signature

**Explain how React uses a tree data structure called the “virtual DOM” to model the DOM**

> ↠The Virtual DOM is an in-memory tree representation of the browser’s Document Object Model. React’s philosophy is to interact with the Virtual DOM instead of the regular DOM for developer ease and performance.

> ↠By abstracting the key concepts from the DOM, React is able to expose additional tooling and functionality increasing developer ease.

> ↠By trading off the additional memory requirements of the Virtual DOM, React is able to optimize for efficient subtree comparisons, resulting in fewer, simpler updates to the less efficient DOM. The result of these tradeoffs is improved performance.

### **Describe how JSX transforms into React.createElement calls:**

#### ↠JSX is a special format to let you construct virtual DOM nodes using familiar HTML-like syntax. You can put the JSX directly into your .js files, however you must run the JSX through a pre-compiler like <a href="https://babeljs.io/" class="markup--anchor markup--h4-anchor">Babel</a> in order for the browser to understand it.

#### ↠ReactDOM.render is a simple function which accepts 2 arguments: what to render and where to render it:

Fundamental Concepts In Javascript
==================================

This is the stuff that comes up on interviews…

### Fundamental Concepts In Javascript

#### This is the stuff that comes up on interviews…

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*v_HRUxnqaDN-wJd8.png" class="graf-image" /></figure>Or even deeper:

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*2WT03WQBOGKWH_9i.png" class="graf-image" /></figure>### Here are most of the below exercises!

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*Ff29X3kTbA17Qgoz.jpg" class="graf-image" /></figure>-   <span id="1fd7">Label variables as either Primitive vs. Reference</span>
-   <span id="de11">primitives: strings, booleans, numbers, null and undefined</span>
-   <span id="c203">primitives are immutable</span>
-   <span id="254c">refereces: objects (including arrays)</span>
-   <span id="80bc">references are mutable</span>
-   <span id="8b53">Identify when to use `.` vs `[]` when accessing values of an object</span>
-   <span id="cb76">dot syntax `object.key`</span>
-   <span id="91bc">easier to read</span>
-   <span id="7ff8">easier to write</span>
-   <span id="a46a">cannot use variables as keys</span>
-   <span id="74e2">keys cannot begin with a number</span>
-   <span id="c648">bracket notation `object["key]`</span>
-   <span id="5677">allows variables as keys</span>
-   <span id="f562">strings that start with numbers can be use as keys</span>
-   <span id="08df">Write an object literal with a variable key using interpolation</span>

### put it in brackets to access the value of the variable, rather than just making the value that string

-   <span id="d0b0">Use the `obj[key] !== undefined` pattern to check if a given variable that contains a key exists in an object</span>
-   <span id="9f75">can also use `(key in object)` syntax interchangeably (returns a boolean)</span>
-   <span id="811d">Utilize Object.keys and Object.values in a function</span>
-   <span id="1f44">`Object.keys(obj)` returns an array of all the keys in `obj`</span>
-   <span id="8efe">`Object.values(obj)` returns an array of the values in `obj`</span>

### Iterate through an object using a `for         in` loop

### Define a function that utilizes `...rest` syntax to accept an arbitrary number of arguments

-   <span id="eb23">`...rest` syntax will store all additional arguments in an array</span>
-   <span id="e2d4">array will be empty if there are no additional arguments</span>

### Use `...spread` syntax for Object literals and Array literals

-   <span id="438a">Destructure an array to reference specific elements</span>

### Write a function that accepts a array as an argument and returns an object representing the count of each character in the array

### Callbacks Lesson Concepts

-   <span id="133e">Given multiple plausible reasons, identify why functions are called “First Class Objects” in JavaScript.</span>
-   <span id="22a1">they can be stored in variables, passed as arguments to other functions, and serve as return value for a function</span>
-   <span id="5b83">supports same basic operations as other types (strings, bools, numbers)</span>
-   <span id="2419">higher-order functions take functions as arguments or return functions as values</span>
-   <span id="2cc7">Given a code snippet containing an anonymous callback, a named callback, and multiple `console.log`s, predict what will be printed</span>
-   <span id="7d16">what is this referring to?</span>
-   <span id="e1c6">Write a function that takes in a value and two callbacks. The function should return the result of the callback that is greater.</span>

#### Write a function, myMap, that takes in an array and a callback as arguments. The function should mimic the behavior of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map" class="markup--anchor markup--h4-anchor"><code>Array#map</code>.</a>

### Write a function, myFilter, that takes in an array and a callback as arguments. The function should mimic the behavior of `Array#filter`.

### Write a function, myEvery, that takes in an array and a callback as arguments. The function should mimic the behavior of `Array#every`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Scope Lesson Concepts

-   <span id="cd3f">Identify the difference between `const`, `let`, and `var` declarations</span>

> `const` ***- cannot reassign variable, scoped to block***

> `let` ***- can reassign variable, scoped to block***

> `var` ***- outdated, may or may not be reassigned, scoped to function. can be not just reassigned, but also redeclared!***

-   <span id="dc31">*a variable will always evaluate to the value it contains regardless of how it was declared*</span>

#### Explain the difference between `const`, `let`, and `var` declarations

> `var` *is function scoped—so if you declare it anywhere in a function, the declaration* ***(but not assignment…the fact that it exists is known to the javascript engine but the value assigned to it is a mystery until the code is run line by line!) is “hoisted”*** *so it will* ***exist in memory as “undefined”*** *which is bad and unpredictable*

> `var` *will also allow you to redeclare a variable, while* `let` *or* `const` *will raise a syntax error. you shouldn’t be able to do that!*

#### `!!const` *won’t let you reassign a variable!!*

> *but if it points to a mutable object, you will still be able to change the value by mutating the object*

-   <span id="2e8a">**block-scoped variables allow new variables with the same name in new scopes**</span>
-   <span id="b7a6">block-scoped still performs hoisting of all variables within the block, but it doesn’t **initialize to the value of** `undefined` **like** `var` **does,** so it throws a specific reference error if you try to access the value before it has been declared</span>
-   <span id="d64f">**if you do not use** `var` **or** `let` **or** `const` **when initializing, it will be declared as global—THIS IS BAD** *(pretend that’s something you didn’t even know you could do)*</span>
-   <span id="a6c4">if you assign a value without a declaration*(la la la la….I’m not listening)*, it exists in the global scope (so then it would be accessible by all outer scopes, so bad). however, there’s no hoisting, so it doesn’t exist in the scope until after the line is run.</span>

### Predict the evaluation of code that utilizes function scope, block scope, lexical scope, and scope chaining

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*P22Rwsk7Uzn5vJNS.png" class="graf-image" /></figure>-   <span id="904e">**scope of a program means the set of variables that are available for use within the program**</span>
-   <span id="2aa4">**global scope is represented by the** `window` **object in the browser and the** `global` **object in Node.js**</span>
-   <span id="e255">*global variables are available everywhere, and so increase the risk of name collisions*</span>

#### local scope is the set of variables available for use within the function

-   <span id="bb8a">when we enter a function, we enter a new scope</span>
-   <span id="6bc8">includes functions arguments, local variables declared inside function, and any variables that were already declared when the function is defined (hmm about that last one)</span>
-   <span id="b80e">for blocks (denoted by curly braces `{}`, as in conditionals or `for` loops), variables can be block scoped</span>
-   <span id="5ae1">inner scope does not have access to variables in the outer scope</span>
-   <span id="068c">scope chaining — if a given variable is not found in immediate scope, javascript will search all accessible outer scopes until variable is found</span>
-   <span id="c44e">so an inner scope can access outer scope variables</span>
-   <span id="37e1">but an outer scope can never access inner scope variables</span>

### Define an arrow function

### Given an arrow function, deduce the value of `this` without executing the code

-   <span id="98d6">arrow functions are automatically bound to the context they were declared in.</span>
-   <span id="c91b">unlike regular function which use the context they are invoked in (unless they have been bound using `Function#bind`).</span>
-   <span id="66a9">if you implement an arrow function as a method in an object the context it will be bound to is NOT the object itself, but the global context.</span>
-   <span id="b6e8">so you can’t use an arrow function to define a method directly</span>

### Implement a closure and explain how the closure effects scope

#### a closure is “the combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared”

-   <span id="bb50">**alternatively, “when an inner function uses or changes variables in an outer function”**</span>
-   <span id="87c8">closures have access to any variables within their own scope + scope of outer functions + global scope</span>
-   <span id="a9e4">the set of all these available variables is “lexical environemnt”</span>
-   <span id="8562">closure keeps reference to all variables \*\* even if the outer function has returned</span>
-   <span id="0a13">Without a closure to access the variables of an outer function from within a call to an inner function the outer function ‘closed’ over …each function has a private mutable state that cannot be accessed externally</span>
-   <span id="2d6a">The inner function will maintain a reference to the scope in which it was declared.so it has access to variables that were initialized in any outer scope- even if that scope</span>
-   <span id="d0d9">The inner function will maintain a reference to the scope in which it was declared.so it has access to variables that were initialized in any outer scope- even if that scope</span>

### Q:

#### if a variable exists in the scope of what could have been accessed by a function(e.g.global scope, outer function, etc), does that variable wind up in the closure even if it never got accessed ?

### A:

#### if you change the value of a variable(e.g.i++) you will change the value of that variable in the scope that it was declared in

### Define a method that references `this` on an object literal

-   <span id="e43c">when we use `this` in a method it refers to the object that the method is invoked on</span>
-   <span id="568d">it will let you access other pieces of information from within that object, or even other methods</span>
-   <span id="3cc8">method style invocation — `object.method(args)` (e.g. built in examples like `Array#push`, or `String#toUpperCase`)</span>
-   <span id="e9b1">context is set every time we invoke a function</span>
-   <span id="5423">function style invocation sets the context to the global object no matter what</span>
-   <span id="31b8">being inside an object does not make the context that object! you still have to use method-style invocation</span>
-   <span id="fa5a">Utilize the built in `Function#bind` on a callback to maintain the context of this</span>
-   <span id="5e6d">when we call bind on a function, we get an exotic function back — so the context will always be the same for that new function</span>

can also work with arguments, so you can have a version of a function with particular arguments and a particular context.the first arg will be the context aka the \`this\` you want it to use.the next arguments will be the functions arguments that you are binding — if you just want to bind it to those arguments in particular, you can use \`null\` as the first argument, so the context won ‘t be bound, just the arguments — Given a code snippet, identify what \`this\` refers to

> Important to recognize the difference between scope and context

-   <span id="a071">**scope works like a dictionary that has all the variables that are available within a given block, plus a pointer back the next outer scope(which itself has pointers to new scopes until you reach the global scope.so you can think about a whole given block ‘s scope as a kind of linked list of dictionaries) (also, this is not to say that scope is actually implemented in this way, that is just the schema that i can use to understand it)**</span>

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*ATcQhZwwSH5EPFWk.gif" class="graf-image" /></figure>-   <span id="f933">**context refers to the value of the \`this\` keyword**</span>
-   <span id="03e2">the keyword \`this\` exists in every function and it evaluates to the object that is currently invoking that function</span>
-   <span id="7933">so the context is fairly straightforward when we talk about methods being called on specific objects</span>
-   <span id="f7bb">you could, however, call an object ‘s method on something other than that object, and then this would refer to the context where/how it was called, e.g.</span>

### CALLING SOMETHING IN THE WRONG CONTEXT CAN MESS YOU UP!

-   <span id="1757">could throw an error if it expects this to have some other method or whatever that doesn’t exist</span>
-   <span id="11b1">you could also overwrite values or assign values to exist in a space where they should not exist</span>
-   <span id="e2bc">if you call a function as a callback, it will set `this` to be the outer function itself, even if the function you were calling is a method that was called on a particular object</span>

we can use strict mode with `"use strict";` this will prevent you from accessing the global object with `this` in functions, so if you try to call `this` in the global context and change a value, you will get a type error, and the things you try to access will be undefined

-   <span id="2d21">CALLING SOMETHING IN THE WRONG CONTEXT CAN MESS YOU UP!</span>
-   <span id="e8e4">could throw an error if it expects this to have some other method or whatever that doesn’t exist</span>
-   <span id="b227">you could also overwrite values or assign values to exist in a space where they should not exist</span>
-   <span id="a0a0">if you call a function as a callback, it will set `this` to be the outer function itself, even if the function you were calling is a method that was called on a particular object</span>

> *we can use strict mode with* `"use strict";` *this will prevent you from accessing the global object with* `this` *in functions, so if you try to call* `this` *in the global context and change a value, you will get a type error, and the things you try to access will be undefined*

### POJOs

### POJOs

#### 1. Label variables as either Primitive vs. Reference

Javascript considers most data types to be ‘primitive’, these data types are immutable, and are passed by value. The more complex data types: Array and Object are mutable, are considered ‘reference’ data types, and are passed by reference.

-   <span id="05bb">Boolean — Primitive</span>
-   <span id="a5ab">Null — Primitive</span>
-   <span id="8aa7">Undefined — Primitive</span>
-   <span id="5c6b">Number — Primitive</span>
-   <span id="2e68">String — Primitive</span>
-   <span id="e2a1">Array — Reference</span>
-   <span id="1fe0">Object — Reference</span>
-   <span id="545b">Function — Reference</span>

#### 2. Identify when to use . vs \[\] when accessing values of an object

#### 3. Write an object literal with a variable key using interpolation

#### 4. Use the obj\[key\] !== undefined pattern to check if a given variable that contains a key exists in an object

#### 5. Utilize Object.keys and Object.values in a function

#### 6. Iterate through an object using a for in loop

#### 7. Define a function that utilizes …rest syntax to accept an arbitrary number of arguments

#### 8. Use …spread syntax for Object literals and Array literals

#### 9. Destructure an array to reference specific elements

#### 10. Destructure an object to reference specific values

#### 11. Write a function that accepts a string as an argument and returns an object representing the count of each character in the array

### Review of Concepts

#### 1. Identify the difference between const, let, and var declarations

#### 2. Explain the difference between const, let, and var declarations

    var a = "a";

-   <span id="cb01">`var` is the historical keyword used for variable declaration.</span>
-   <span id="f2d5">`var` declares variables in function scope, or global scope if not inside a function.</span>
-   <span id="8c4a">We consider `var` to be deprecated and it is never used in this course.</span>

<!-- -->

    let b = "b";

-   <span id="9912">`let` is the keyword we use most often for variable declaration.</span>
-   <span id="f9dd">`let` declares variables in block scope.</span>
-   <span id="75e1">variables declared with `let` are re-assignable.</span>

<!-- -->

    const c = "c";

-   <span id="5f80">`const` is a specialized form of `let` that can only be used to initialize a variable.</span>
-   <span id="7bc0">Except when it is declared, you cannot assign to a `const` variable.</span>
-   <span id="5df7">`const` scopes variables the same way that `let` does.</span>

#### 3. Predict the evaluation of code that utilizes function scope, block scope, lexical scope, and scope chaining

Consider this `run` function, inside which `foo` and `bar` have `function         scope` . `i` and `baz` are scoped to the block expression.

Notice that referencing `baz` from outside it’s block results in JavaScript throwing a ReferenceError.

Consider this `run` function, inside of which `foo` has `function scope` .

#### 6. Implement a closure and explain how the closure effects scope

#### 4. Define an arrow function

    const returnValue = (val) => val;

This simple construct will create a function that accepts `val` as a parameter, and returns `val` immediately. We do not need to type `return val` , because this is a single-line function.

Identically, we could write

    const returnValue = (val) => {
        return val;
    };

#### 5. Given an arrow function, deduce the value of `this` without executing the code

If we use a function declaration style function, the `this` variable is set to the `global` object (i.e. `Object [global]` in Node. JS and `Window` in your browser).

    const adder = (arr) => {
        console.log(this);
        arr.reduce((acc, ele) => sum += ele);
    };
    adder([1, 2, 4, 6]);

In this example, we use a fat arrow style function. Note that when we declare a functions like this `this` becomes

### ***space***

> *The space complexity represents the memory consumption of a data structure. As for most of the things in life, you can’t have it all, so it is with the data structures. You will generally need to trade some time for space or the other way around.*

### *time*

> *The time complexity for a data structure is in general more diverse than its space complexity.*

### *Several operations*

> *In contrary to algorithms, when you look at the time complexity for data structures you need to express it for several operations that you can do with data structures. It can be adding elements, deleting elements, accessing an element or even searching for an element.*

### *Dependent on data*

> *Something that data structure and algorithms have in common when talking about time complexity is that they are both dealing with data. When you deal with data you become dependent on them and as a result the time complexity is also dependent of the data that you received. To solve this problem we talk about 3 different time complexity.*

-   <span id="bc8d">**The best-case complexity: when the data looks the best**</span>
-   <span id="8b06">**The worst-case complexity: when the data looks the worst**</span>
-   <span id="881c">**The average-case complexity: when the data looks average**</span>

### Big O notation

The complexity is usually expressed with the Big O notation. The wikipedia page about this subject is pretty complex but you can find here a good summary of the different complexity for the most famous data structures and sorting algorithms.

### The Array data structure

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*Qk3UYgeqXamRrFLR.gif" class="graf-image" /></figure>### Definition

An Array data structure, or simply an Array, is a data structure consisting of a collection of elements (values or variables), each identified by at least one array index or key. The simplest type of data structure is a linear array, also called one-dimensional array. From Wikipedia

Arrays are among the oldest and most important data structures and are used by every program. They are also used to implement many other data structures.

1.  <span id="b953">The index of an array **runs in sequence**</span>

2.  This could be useful for storing data that are required to be ordered, such as rankings or queues

3.  In JavaScript, array’s value could be mixed; meaning value of each index could be of different data, be it String, Number or even Objects

### 2. Objects

Think of objects as a logical grouping of a bunch of properties.

Properties could be some variable that it’s storing or some methods that it’s using.

I also visualize an object as a table.

The main difference is that object’s “index” need not be numbers and is not necessarily sequenced.

> *A Hash Table (Hash Map) is a data structure used to implement an associative array, a structure that can map keys to values. A Hash Table uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found. From Wikipedia*

Hash Tables are considered the more efficient data structure for lookup and for this reason, they are widely used.

### The Set

### Sets

Sets are pretty much what it sounds like. It’s the same intuition as Set in Mathematics. I visualize Sets as Venn Diagrams.

> *A Set is an abstract data type that can store certain values, without any particular order, and no repeated values. It is a computer implementation of the mathematical concept of a finite Set. From Wikipedia*

The Set data structure is usually used to test whether elements belong to set of values. Rather then only containing elements, Sets are more used to perform operations on multiple values at once with methods such as union, intersect, etc…

### The Singly Linked List

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*fLs64rV-Xq19aVCA.gif" class="graf-image" /></figure>### *Definition*

> *A Singly Linked List is a linear collection of data elements, called nodes pointing to the next node by means of pointer. It is a data structure consisting of a group of nodes which together represent a sequence. Under the simplest form, each node is composed of data and a reference (in other words, a link) to the next node in the sequence.*

Linked Lists are among the simplest and most common data structures because it allows for efficient insertion or removal of elements from any position in the sequence.

### The Doubly Linked List

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*TQXiR-L_itiG3WP-.gif" class="graf-image" /></figure>### *Definition*

> *A Doubly Linked List is a linked data structure that consists of a set of sequentially linked records called nodes. Each node contains two fields, called links, that are references to the previous and to the next node in the sequence of nodes. From Wikipedia*

Having two node links allow traversal in either direction but adding or removing a node in a doubly linked list requires changing more links than the same operations on a Singly Linked List.

### The Stack

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/0*qsjYW-Lvfo22ecLE.gif" class="graf-image" /></figure>### *Definition*

> *A Stack is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, with two principal operations: push, which adds an element to the collection, and pop, which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed. The order in which elements come off a Stack gives rise to its alternative name, LIFO (for last in, first out). From Wikipedia*

A Stack often has a third method peek which allows to check the last pushed element without popping it.

### The Queue

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*YvfuX5tKP7-V0p7v.gif" class="graf-image" /></figure>### *Definition*

> *A Queue is a particular kind of abstract data type or collection in which the entities in the collection are kept in order and the principal operations are the addition of entities to the rear terminal position, known as enqueue, and removal of entities from the front terminal position, known as dequeue. This makes the Queue a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure. In a FIFO data structure, the first element added to the Queue will be the first one to be removed.*

As for the Stack data structure, a peek operation is often added to the Queue data structure. It returns the value of the front element without dequeuing it.

### The Tree

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*yUiQ-NaPKeLQnN7n" class="graf-image" /></figure>### *Definition*

> *A Tree is a widely used data structure that simulates a hierarchical tree structure, with a root value and subtrees of children with a parent node. A tree data structure can be defined recursively as a collection of nodes (starting at a root node), where each node is a data structure consisting of a value, together with a list of references to nodes (the “children”), with the constraints that no reference is duplicated, and none points to the root node. From Wikipedia*

### The Graph

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*q31mL1kjFWlIzw3l.gif" class="graf-image" /></figure>### *Definition*

> *A Graph data structure consists of a finite (and possibly mutable) set of vertices or nodes or points, together with a set of unordered pairs of these vertices for an undirected Graph or a set of ordered pairs for a directed Graph. These pairs are known as edges, arcs, or lines for an undirected Graph and as arrows, directed edges, directed arcs, or directed lines for a directed Graph. The vertices may be part of the Graph structure, or may be external entities represented by integer indices or references.*

-   <span id="f896">A graph is **any** collection of nodes and edges.</span>
-   <span id="fbda">Much more relaxed in structure than a tree.</span>
-   <span id="5281">It doesn’t need to have a root node (not every node needs to be accessible from a single node)</span>
-   <span id="0c79">It can have cycles (a group of nodes whose paths begin and end at the same node)</span>
-   <span id="4afc">Cycles are not always “isolated”, they can be one part of a larger graph. You can detect them by starting your search on a specific node and finding a path that takes you back to that same node.</span>
-   <span id="8f45">Any number of edges may leave a given node</span>
-   <span id="51cf">A Path is a sequence of nodes on a graph</span>

### Cycle Visual

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*dn1BqCdXdFg4FCVSz6uArA.png" class="graf-image" /></figure>A Graph data structure may also associate to each edge some edge value, such as a symbolic label or a numeric attribute (cost, capacity, length, etc.).

Representation  
There are different ways of representing a graph, each of them with its own advantages and disadvantages. Here are the main 2:

Adjacency list: For every vertex a list of adjacent vertices is stored. This can be viewed as storing the list of edges. This data structure allows the storage of additional data on the vertices and edges.  
Adjacency matrix: Data are stored in a two-dimensional matrix, in which the rows represent source vertices and columns represent destination vertices. The data on the edges and vertices must be stored externally.

### Fundamental Data Structures in JavaScript

#### A simple to follow guide to Lists Stacks and Queues, with animated gifs, diagrams, and code examples!

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2560/0*ph952PPOmG5uz_Pv" class="graf-image" /></figure><figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*zhC6dP1hb2rq2qt2.png" class="graf-image" /></figure>### Linked Lists

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*znES1vYRV3Zvk9-e.gif" class="graf-image" /></figure>In the university setting, it’s common for Linked Lists to appear early on in an undergraduate’s Computer Science coursework. While they don’t always have the most practical real-world applications in industry, Linked Lists make for an important and effective educational tool in helping develop a student’s mental model on what data structures actually are to begin with.

Linked lists are simple. They have many compelling, reoccurring edge cases to consider that emphasize to the student the need for care and intent while implementing data structures. They can be applied as the underlying data structure while implementing a variety of other prevalent abstract data types, such as Lists, Stacks, and Queues, and they have a level of versatility high enough to clearly illustrate the value of the Object Oriented Programming paradigm.

They also come up in software engineering interviews quite often.

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*OYmTpAK6tyDQzoIE.gif" class="graf-image" /></figure>### What is a Linked List?

A Linked List data structure represents a linear sequence of “vertices” (or “nodes”), and tracks three important properties.

**Linked List Properties:**

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*z-i1wE6QPOtqxGiW_B6WuA.png" class="graf-image" /></figure>The data being tracked by a particular Linked List does not live inside the Linked List instance itself. Instead, each vertex is actually an instance of an even simpler, smaller data structure, often referred to as a “Node”.

Depending on the type of Linked List (there are many), Node instances track some very important properties as well.

**Linked List Node Properties:**

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*vagMBs5Quwv8b8tvF4W6Og.png" class="graf-image" /></figure>Property Description `value`: The actual value this node represents.`next`The next node in the list (relative to this node).`previous`The previous node in the list (relative to this node).

**NOTE:** The `previous` property is for Doubly Linked Lists only!

Linked Lists contain *ordered* data, just like arrays. The first node in the list is, indeed, first. From the perspective of the very first node in the list, the *next* node is the second node. From the perspective of the second node in the list, the *previous* node is the first node, and the *next* node is the third node. And so it goes.

#### “So…this sounds a lot like an Array…”

Admittedly, this does *sound* a lot like an Array so far, and that’s because Arrays and Linked Lists are both implementations of the List ADT. However, there is an incredibly important distinction to be made between Arrays and Linked Lists, and that is how they *physically store* their data. (As opposed to how they *represent* the order of their data.)

Recall that Arrays contain *contiguous* data. Each element of an array is actually stored *next to* it’s neighboring element *in the actual hardware of your machine*, in a single continuous block in memory.

*An Array’s contiguous data being stored in a continuous block of addresses in memory.*

Unlike Arrays, Linked Lists contain *non-contiguous* data. Though Linked Lists *represent* data that is ordered linearly, that mental model is just that — an interpretation of the *representation* of information, not reality.

In reality, in the actual hardware of your machine, whether it be in disk or in memory, a Linked List’s Nodes are not stored in a single continuous block of addresses. Rather, Linked List Nodes live at randomly distributed addresses throughout your machine! The only reason we know which node comes next in the list is because we’ve assigned its reference to the current node’s `next` pointer.

*A Singly Linked List’s non-contiguous data (Nodes) being stored at randomly distributed addresses in memory.*

For this reason, Linked List Nodes have *no indices*, and no *random access*. Without random access, we do not have the ability to look up an individual Linked List Node in constant time. Instead, to find a particular Node, we have to start at the very first Node and iterate through the Linked List one node at a time, checking each Node’s *next* Node until we find the one we’re interested in.

So when implementing a Linked List, we actually must implement both the Linked List class *and* the Node class. Since the actual data lives in the Nodes, it’s simpler to implement the Node class first.

### Types of Linked Lists

There are four flavors of Linked List you should be familiar with when walking into your job interviews.

**Linked List Types:**

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ZoYIEJaOpPiYAuqtPLt8yw.png" class="graf-image" /></figure>***Note:*** *These Linked List types are not always mutually exclusive.*

For instance:

-   <span id="a0e8">Any type of Linked List can be implemented Circularly (e.g. A Circular Doubly Linked List).</span>
-   <span id="c0ff">A Doubly Linked List is actually just a special case of a Multiply Linked List.</span>

You are most likely to encounter Singly and Doubly Linked Lists in your upcoming job search, so we are going to focus exclusively on those two moving forward. However, in more senior level interviews, it is very valuable to have some familiarity with the other types of Linked Lists. Though you may not actually code them out, *you will win extra points by illustrating your ability to weigh the tradeoffs of your technical decisions* by discussing how your choice of Linked List type may affect the efficiency of the solutions you propose.

### Linked List Methods

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*9EnhpQAeV03_DyEZIyiTCw.png" class="graf-image" /></figure>Linked Lists are great foundation builders when learning about data structures because they share a number of similar methods (and edge cases) with many other common data structures. You will find that many of the concepts discussed here will repeat themselves as we dive into some of the more complex non-linear data structures later on, like Trees and Graphs.

### Time and Space Complexity Analysis

Before we begin our analysis, here is a quick summary of the Time and Space constraints of each Linked List Operation. The complexities below apply to both Singly and Doubly Linked Lists:

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*Enb9YaqRxzS87ML83Loasw.png" class="graf-image" /></figure>Before moving forward, see if you can reason to yourself why each operation has the time and space complexity listed above!

### Time Complexity — Access and Search

#### Scenarios

1.  <span id="16fe">We have a Linked List, and we’d like to find the 8th item in the list.</span>
2.  <span id="a9f7">We have a Linked List of sorted alphabet letters, and we’d like to see if the letter “Q” is inside that list.</span>

#### Discussion

Unlike Arrays, Linked Lists Nodes are not stored contiguously in memory, and thereby do not have an indexed set of memory addresses at which we can quickly lookup individual nodes in constant time. Instead, we must begin at the head of the list (or possibly at the tail, if we have a Doubly Linked List), and iterate through the list until we arrive at the node of interest.

In Scenario 1, we’ll know we’re there because we’ve iterated 8 times. In Scenario 2, we’ll know we’re there because, while iterating, we’ve checked each node’s value and found one that matches our target value, “Q”.

In the worst case scenario, we may have to traverse the entire Linked List until we arrive at the final node. This makes both Access & Search **Linear Time** operations.

### Time Complexity — Insertion and Deletion

#### Scenarios

1.  <span id="2462">We have an empty Linked List, and we’d like to insert our first node.</span>
2.  <span id="ae0b">We have a Linked List, and we’d like to insert or delete a node at the Head or Tail.</span>
3.  <span id="290b">We have a Linked List, and we’d like to insert or delete a node from somewhere in the middle of the list.</span>

#### Discussion

Since we have our Linked List Nodes stored in a non-contiguous manner that relies on pointers to keep track of where the next and previous nodes live, Linked Lists liberate us from the linear time nature of Array insertions and deletions. We no longer have to adjust the position at which each node/element is stored after making an insertion at a particular position in the list. Instead, if we want to insert a new node at position `i`, we can simply:

1.  <span id="7675">Create a new node.</span>
2.  <span id="adf9">Set the new node’s `next` and `previous` pointers to the nodes that live at positions `i` and `i - 1`, respectively.</span>
3.  <span id="1bf6">Adjust the `next` pointer of the node that lives at position `i - 1` to point to the new node.</span>
4.  <span id="9580">Adjust the `previous` pointer of the node that lives at position `i` to point to the new node.</span>

And we’re done, in Constant Time. No iterating across the entire list necessary.

“But hold on one second,” you may be thinking. “In order to insert a new node in the middle of the list, don’t we have to lookup its position? Doesn’t that take linear time?!”

Yes, it is tempting to call insertion or deletion in the middle of a Linked List a linear time operation since there is lookup involved. However, it’s usually the case that you’ll already have a reference to the node where your desired insertion or deletion will occur.

For this reason, we separate the Access time complexity from the Insertion/Deletion time complexity, and formally state that Insertion and Deletion in a Linked List are **Constant Time** across the board.

***Note:*** *Without a reference to the node at which an insertion or deletion will occur, due to linear time lookup, an insertion or deletion in the middle of a Linked List will still take Linear Time, sum total.*

### Space Complexity

#### Scenarios

1.  <span id="12d2">We’re given a Linked List, and need to operate on it.</span>
2.  <span id="7c5f">We’ve decided to create a new Linked List as part of strategy to solve some problem.</span>

#### Discussion

It’s obvious that Linked Lists have one node for every one item in the list, and for that reason we know that Linked Lists take up Linear Space in memory. However, when asked in an interview setting what the Space Complexity *of your solution* to a problem is, it’s important to recognize the difference between the two scenarios above.

In Scenario 1, we *are not* creating a new Linked List. We simply need to operate on the one given. Since we are not storing a *new* node for every node represented in the Linked List we are provided, our solution is *not necessarily* linear in space.

In Scenario 2, we *are* creating a new Linked List. If the number of nodes we create is linearly correlated to the size of our input data, we are now operating in Linear Space.

***Note****: Linked Lists can be traversed both iteratively and recursively. If you choose to traverse a Linked List recursively, there will be a recursive function call added to the call stack for every node in the Linked List. Even if you’re provided the Linked List, as in Scenario 1, you will still use Linear Space in the call stack, and that counts.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Stacks and Queues

Stacks and Queues aren’t really “data structures” by the strict definition of the term. The more appropriate terminology would be to call them abstract data types (ADTs), meaning that their definitions are more conceptual and related to the rules governing their user-facing behaviors rather than their core implementations.

For the sake of simplicity, we’ll refer to them as data structures and ADTs interchangeably throughout the course, but the distinction is an important one to be familiar with as you level up as an engineer.

Now that that’s out of the way, Stacks and Queues represent a linear collection of nodes or values. In this way, they are quite similar to the Linked List data structure we discussed in the previous section. In fact, you can even use a modified version of a Linked List to implement each of them. (Hint, hint.)

These two ADTs are similar to each other as well, but each obey their own special rule regarding the order with which Nodes can be added and removed from the structure.

Since we’ve covered Linked Lists in great length, these two data structures will be quick and easy. Let’s break them down individually in the next couple of sections.

### What is a Stack?

Stacks are a Last In First Out (LIFO) data structure. The last Node added to a stack is always the first Node to be removed, and as a result, the first Node added is always the last Node removed.

The name Stack actually comes from this characteristic, as it is helpful to visualize the data structure as a vertical stack of items. Personally, I like to think of a Stack as a stack of plates, or a stack of sheets of paper. This seems to make them more approachable, because the analogy relates to something in our everyday lives.

If you can imagine adding items to, or removing items from, a Stack of…literally anything…you’ll realize that every (sane) person naturally obeys the LIFO rule.

We add things to the *top* of a stack. We remove things from the *top* of a stack. We never add things to, or remove things from, the *bottom* of the stack. That’s just crazy.

Note: We can use JavaScript Arrays to implement a basic stack. `Array#push` adds to the top of the stack and `Array#pop` will remove from the top of the stack. In the exercise that follows, we’ll build our own Stack class from scratch (without using any arrays). In an interview setting, your evaluator may be okay with you using an array as a stack.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### What is a Queue?

Queues are a First In First Out (FIFO) data structure. The first Node added to the queue is always the first Node to be removed.

The name Queue comes from this characteristic, as it is helpful to visualize this data structure as a horizontal line of items with a beginning and an end. Personally, I like to think of a Queue as the line one waits on for an amusement park, at a grocery store checkout, or to see the teller at a bank.

If you can imagine a queue of humans waiting…again, for literally anything…you’ll realize that *most* people (the civil ones) naturally obey the FIFO rule.

People add themselves to the *back* of a queue, wait their turn in line, and make their way toward the *front*. People exit from the *front* of a queue, but only when they have made their way to being first in line.

We never add ourselves to the front of a queue (unless there is no one else in line), otherwise we would be “cutting” the line, and other humans don’t seem to appreciate that.

Note: We can use JavaScript Arrays to implement a basic queue. `Array#push` adds to the back (enqueue) and `Array#shift` will remove from the front (dequeue). In the exercise that follows, we’ll build our own Queue class from scratch (without using any arrays). In an interview setting, your evaluator may be okay with you using an array as a queue.

### Stack and Queue Properties

Stacks and Queues are so similar in composition that we can discuss their properties together. They track the following three properties:

**Stack Properties | Queue Properties:**

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*aZCnZJzaeY74DTb2CTRuFA.png" class="graf-image" /></figure>Notice that rather than having a `head` and a `tail` like Linked Lists, Stacks have a `top`, and Queues have a `front` and a `back` instead. Stacks don’t have the equivalent of a `tail` because you only ever push or pop things off the top of Stacks. These properties are essentially the same; pointers to the end points of the respective List ADT where important actions way take place. The differences in naming conventions are strictly for human comprehension.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Similarly to Linked Lists, the values stored inside a Stack or a Queue are actually contained within Stack Node and Queue Node instances. Stack, Queue, and Singly Linked List Nodes are all identical, but just as a reminder and for the sake of completion, these List Nodes track the following two properties:

### Time and Space Complexity Analysis

Before we begin our analysis, here is a quick summary of the Time and Space constraints of each Stack Operation.

Data Structure Operation Time Complexity (Avg)Time Complexity (Worst)Space Complexity (Worst)Access`Θ(n)O(n)O(n)`Search`Θ(n)O(n)O(n)`Insertion`Θ(1)O(1)O(n)`Deletion`Θ(1)O(1)O(n)`

Before moving forward, see if you can reason to yourself why each operation has the time and space complexity listed above!

#### Time Complexity — Access and Search

When the Stack ADT was first conceived, its inventor definitely did not prioritize searching and accessing individual Nodes or values in the list. The same idea applies for the Queue ADT. There are certainly better data structures for speedy search and lookup, and if these operations are a priority for your use case, it would be best to choose something else!

Search and Access are both linear time operations for Stacks and Queues, and that shouldn’t be too unclear. Both ADTs are nearly identical to Linked Lists in this way. The only way to find a Node somewhere in the middle of a Stack or a Queue, is to start at the `top` (or the `back`) and traverse downward (or forward) toward the `bottom` (or `front`) one node at a time via each Node’s `next` property.

This is a linear time operation, O(n).

#### Time Complexity — Insertion and Deletion

For Stacks and Queues, insertion and deletion is what it’s all about. If there is one feature a Stack absolutely must have, it’s constant time insertion and removal to and from the `top` of the Stack (FIFO). The same applies for Queues, but with insertion occurring at the `back` and removal occurring at the `front` (LIFO).

Think about it. When you add a plate to the top of a stack of plates, do you have to iterate through all of the other plates first to do so? Of course not. You simply add your plate to the top of the stack, and that’s that. The concept is the same for removal.

Therefore, Stacks and Queues have constant time Insertion and Deletion via their `push` and `pop` or `enqueue` and `dequeue` methods, O(1).

#### Space Complexity

The space complexity of Stacks and Queues is very simple. Whether we are instantiating a new instance of a Stack or Queue to store a set of data, or we are using a Stack or Queue as part of a strategy to solve some problem, Stacks and Queues always store one Node for each value they receive as input.

For this reason, we always consider Stacks and Queues to have a linear space complexity, O(n).

### When should we use Stacks and Queues?

At this point, we’ve done a lot of work understanding the ins and outs of Stacks and Queues, but we still haven’t really discussed what we can use them for. The answer is actually…a lot!

For one, Stacks and Queues can be used as intermediate data structures while implementing some of the more complicated data structures and methods we’ll see in some of our upcoming sections.

For example, the implementation of the breadth-first Tree traversal algorithm takes advantage of a Queue instance, and the depth-first Graph traversal algorithm exploits the benefits of a Stack instance.

Additionally, Stacks and Queues serve as the essential underlying data structures to a wide variety of applications you use all the time. Just to name a few:

#### Stacks

-   <span id="f63a">The Call Stack is a Stack data structure, and is used to manage the order of function invocations in your code.</span>
-   <span id="6b24">Browser History is often implemented using a Stack, with one great example being the browser history object in the very popular React Router module.</span>
-   <span id="098f">Undo/Redo functionality in just about any application. For example:</span>
-   <span id="f15d">When you’re coding in your text editor, each of the actions you take on your keyboard are recorded by `push`ing that event to a Stack.</span>
-   <span id="e303">When you hit \[cmd + z\] to undo your most recent action, that event is `pop`ed off the Stack, because the last event that occured should be the first one to be undone (LIFO).</span>
-   <span id="9248">When you hit \[cmd + y\] to redo your most recent action, that event is `push`ed back onto the Stack.</span>

#### Queues

-   <span id="7c8d">Printers use a Queue to manage incoming jobs to ensure that documents are printed in the order they are received.</span>
-   <span id="89e7">Chat rooms, online video games, and customer service phone lines use a Queue to ensure that patrons are served in the order they arrive.</span>
-   <span id="c02a">In the case of a Chat Room, to be admitted to a size-limited room.</span>
-   <span id="353e">In the case of an Online Multi-Player Game, players wait in a lobby until there is enough space and it is their turn to be admitted to a game.</span>
-   <span id="6a8e">In the case of a Customer Service Phone Line…you get the point.</span>
-   <span id="0ad5">As a more advanced use case, Queues are often used as components or services in the system design of a service-oriented architecture. A very popular and easy to use example of this is Amazon’s Simple Queue Service (SQS), which is a part of their Amazon Web Services (AWS) offering.</span>
-   <span id="48e7">You would add this service to your system between two other services, one that is sending information for processing, and one that is receiving information to be processed, when the volume of incoming requests is high and the integrity of the order with which those requests are processed must be maintained.</span>

### Fundamental Javascript Concepts You Should Understand

### Plain Old JS Object Lesson Concepts

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*bEuahctJRS_qCQgV.jpg" class="graf-image" /></figure>-   <span id="d911">Label variables as either Primitive vs. Reference</span>
-   <span id="42a0">primitives: strings, booleans, numbers, null and undefined</span>
-   <span id="4423">primitives are immutable</span>
-   <span id="fd1a">refereces: objects (including arrays)</span>
-   <span id="d581">references are mutable</span>
-   <span id="65e2">Identify when to use `.` vs `[]` when accessing values of an object</span>
-   <span id="eb9d">dot syntax `object.key`</span>
-   <span id="8e03">easier to read</span>
-   <span id="1662">easier to write</span>
-   <span id="5796">cannot use variables as keys</span>
-   <span id="588a">keys cannot begin with a number</span>
-   <span id="5501">bracket notation `object["key]`</span>
-   <span id="5734">allows variables as keys</span>
-   <span id="76ca">strings that start with numbers can be use as keys</span>
-   <span id="822a">Write an object literal with a variable key using interpolation</span>

#### put it in brackets to access the value of the variable, rather than just make the value that string

    let a = "b";
        let obj = {
            a: "letter_a",
            [a]: "letter b"
        }

-   <span id="e4fc">Use the `obj[key] !== undefined` pattern to check if a given variable that contains a key exists in an object</span>
-   <span id="0baa">can also use `(key in object)` syntax interchangeably (returns a boolean)</span>
-   <span id="ad4c">Utilize Object.keys and Object.values in a function</span>
-   <span id="b548">`Object.keys(obj)` returns an array of all the keys in `obj`</span>
-   <span id="f39b">`Object.values(obj)` returns an array of the values in `obj`</span>

#### Iterate through an object using a `for         in` loop

    let printValues = function(obj) {
          for (let key in obj) {
              let value = obj[key];
              console.log(value);
          }
      }

#### Define a function that utilizes `...rest` syntax to accept an arbitrary number of arguments

-   <span id="58a5">`...rest` syntax will store all additional arguments in an array</span>
-   <span id="5f8b">array will be empty if there are no additional arguments</span>

<!-- -->

    let myFunction = function(str, ...strs) {
            console.log("The first string is " + str);
            console.log("The rest of the strings are:");
            strs.forEach(function(str) {
                console.log(str);
            })
        }

#### Use `...spread` syntax for Object literals and Array literals

    let arr1 = ["a", "b", "c"];
      let longer = [...arr1, "d", "e"]; // ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"]
      // without spread syntax, this would give you a nested array
      let withoutRest = [arr1, "d", "e"] // [["a", "b", "c"], "d", "e"]

-   <span id="118b">Destructure an array to reference specific elements</span>

<!-- -->

    let array = [35, 9];

    let [firstEl, secondEl] = array;

    console.log(firstEl); // => 35

    console.log(secondEl); // => 9

    // can also destructure using … syntax let array = [35, 9, 14]; let [head, …tail] = array; console.log(head); // => 35 console.log(tail); // => [9, 14]

    -Destructure an object to reference specific values
        -
        if you want to use variable names that don 't match the keys, you can use aliasing -
        `let { oldkeyname: newkeyname } = object` -
        rule of thumb— only destructure values from objects that are two levels deep ``
    `javascript
    let obj = {
       name: "Wilfred",
       appearance: ["short", "mustache"],
       favorites: {
          color: "mauve",
          food: "spaghetti squash",
          number: 3
       }
    }
    // with variable names that match keys
    let { name, appearance } = obj;
    console.log(name); // "Wilfred"
    console.log(appearance); // ["short", "mustache"]

    // with new variable names (aliasing)
    let {name: myName, appearance: myAppearance} = obj;

    console.log(myName); // "Wilfred"
    console.log(myAppearance); // ["short", "mustache"]

    // in a function call
    let sayHello = function({name}) {
    console.log("Hello, " + name); // "Hello Wilfred"
    }

    // nested objects + aliasing
    let { favorites: {color, food: vegetable} } = obj;
    console.log(color, vegetable); //=> mauve spaghetti squash

#### Write a function that accepts a array as an argument and returns an object representing the count of each character in the array

    //
      let elementCounts = function(array) {
          let obj = {};
          array.forEach(function(el) {
              if (el in obj) obj[el] += 1;
              else obj[el] = 1;
          })
          return obj;
      }
      console.log(elementCounts(["e", "f", "g", "f"])); // => Object {e: 1, f: 2, g: 1}

### Callbacks Lesson Concepts

-   <span id="a16e">Given multiple plausible reasons, identify why functions are called “First Class Objects” in JavaScript.</span>
-   <span id="0d89">they can be stored in variables, passed as arguments to other functions, and serve as return value for a function</span>
-   <span id="e458">supports same basic operations as other types (strings, bools, numbers)</span>
-   <span id="6af2">higher-order functions take functions as arguments or return functions as values</span>
-   <span id="adbe">Given a code snippet containing an anonymous callback, a named callback, and multiple `console.log`s, predict what will be printed</span>
-   <span id="e93b">what is this referring to?</span>
-   <span id="c73f">Write a function that takes in a value and two callbacks. The function should return the result of the callback that is greater.</span>

<!-- -->

    let greaterCB = function(val, callback1, callback2) {
        if (callback1(val) > callback2(val)) {
            return callback1(val);
        }
        return callback2(val);
    }

    let greaterCB = function(val, callback1, callback2) {
        if (callback1(val) > callback2(val)) {
            return callback1(val);
        }
        return callback2(val);
    }

// shorter version let greaterCB = function(val, callback1, callback2) { return Math.max(callback1(val), callback2(val)); } // even shorter, cause why not let greaterCB = (val, cb1, cb2) =&gt; Math.max(cb1(val), cb2(val));

    -Write a
    function, myMap, that takes in an array and a callback as arguments.The
    function should mimic the behavior of `Array#map`.
    ``
    `javascript
    let myMap = function(array, callback) {
       let newArr = [];
       for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i ++) {
          mapped = callback(array[i], i, array);
          newArr.push(mapped);
       }
       return newArr;
    }
    console.log( myMap([16,25,36], Math.sqrt)); // => [4, 5, 6];
    let myMapArrow = (array, callback) => {

    let newArr = [];

    array.forEach( (ele, ind, array) => {

    newArr.push(callback(ele, ind, array));

    })

    return newArr;

    }

    console.log(myMapArrow([16,25,36], Math.sqrt)); // => [4, 5, 6];
    Write a function, myFilter, that takes in an array and a callback as arguments. The function should mimic the behavior of Array#filter.
    let myFilter = function(array, callback) {
          let filtered = [];
          for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
              if (callback(array[i])) {
                  filtered.push(array[i], i, array);
              }
          }
      }

#### Write a function, myEvery, that takes in an array and a callback as arguments. The function should mimic the behavior of `Array#every`.

    let myEvery = function(array, callback) {
          for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
              if (!callback(array[i], i, array)) {
                  return false
              }
          }
          return true;
      }
      // with arrow function syntax
      let myEvery = (array, callback) => {
          for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
              if (!callback(array[i])) {
                  return false
              }
          }
          return true;
      }

### Scope Lesson Concepts

-   <span id="685f">Identify the difference between `const`, `let`, and `var` declarations</span>
-   <span id="7308">`const` - cannot reassign variable, scoped to block</span>
-   <span id="e07f">`let` - can reassign variable, scoped to block</span>
-   <span id="670d">`var` - outdated, may or may not be reassigned, scoped to function. can be not just reassigned, but also redeclared!</span>
-   <span id="b254">a variable will always evaluate to the value it contains regardless of how it was declared</span>
-   <span id="aace">Explain the difference between `const`, `let`, and `var` declarations</span>
-   <span id="5d79">`var` is function scoped—so if you declare it anywhere in a function, the declaration (but not assignment) is “hoisted”</span>
-   <span id="a54b">so it will exist in memory as “undefined” which is bad and unpredictable</span>
-   <span id="2dc2">`var` will also allow you to redeclare a variable, while `let` or `const` will raise a syntax error. you shouldn’t be able to do that!</span>
-   <span id="1f74">`const` won’t let you reassign a variable, but if it points to a mutable object, you will still be able to change the value by mutating the object</span>
-   <span id="2c20">block-scoped variables allow new variables with the same name in new scopes</span>
-   <span id="c3d4">block-scoped still performs hoisting of all variables within the block, but it doesn’t initialize to the value of `undefined` like `var` does, so it throws a specific reference error if you try to access the value before it has been declared</span>
-   <span id="f797">if you do not use `var` or `let` or `const` when initializing, it will be declared as global—THIS IS BAD</span>
-   <span id="2212">if you assign a value without a declaration, it exists in the global scope (so then it would be accessible by all outer scopes, so bad). however, there’s no hoisting, so it doesn’t exist in the scope until after the line is run</span>
-   <span id="86d1">Predict the evaluation of code that utilizes function scope, block scope, lexical scope, and scope chaining</span>
-   <span id="25dc">scope of a program means the set of variables that are available for use within the program</span>
-   <span id="bcaf">global scope is represented by the `window` object in the browser and the `global` object in Node.js</span>
-   <span id="7bc3">global variables are available everywhere, and so increase the risk of name collisions</span>
-   <span id="5172">local scope is the set of variables available for use within the function</span>
-   <span id="ed33">when we enter a function, we enter a new scope</span>
-   <span id="c21b">includes functions arguments, local variables declared inside function, and any variables that were already declared when the function is defined (hmm about that last one)</span>
-   <span id="51ad">for blocks (denoted by curly braces `{}`, as in conditionals or `for` loops), variables can be block scoped</span>
-   <span id="09f1">inner scope does not have access to variables in the outer scope</span>
-   <span id="587e">scope chaining — if a given variable is not found in immediate scope, javascript will search all accessible outer scopes until variable is found</span>
-   <span id="6ea5">so an inner scope can access outer scope variables</span>
-   <span id="5188">but an outer scope can never access inner scope variables</span>

#### Define an arrow function

    let arrowFunction = (param1, param2) => {
    let sum = param1 + param2;
    return sum;
    }
    // with 1 param you can remove parens around parameters let arrowFunction = param =>
    // if your return statement is one line, you can use implied return let arrowFunction = param => param + 1;
    // you don’t have to assign to variable, can be anonymous // if you never need to use it again param => param + 1;
    Given an arrow function, deduce the value of this without executing the code

    arrow functions are automatically bound to the context they were declared in.
    unlike regular function which use the context they are invoked in (unless they have been bound using Function#bind).
    if you implement an arrow function as a method in an object the context it will be bound to is NOT the object itself, but the global context.
    so you can’t use an arrow function to define a method directly

    let obj = {
    name: “my object”,
    unboundFunc: function () {

    return this.name;

    // this function will be able to be called on different objects

    },
    boundToGlobal: () => { return this.name; // this function, no matter how you call it, will be called // on the global object, and it cannot be rebound // this is because it was defined using arrow syntax },

    makeFuncBoundToObj: function() {
            return () => {
                return this.name;
            }
            // this function will return a function that will be bound
            // to the object where we call the outer method
            // because the arrow syntax is nested inside one of this
            // function's methods, it cannot be rebound
        },

        makeUnboundFunc: function() {
            return function() {
                return this.name;
            }
            //this function will return a function that will still be unbound
        },

        immediatelyInvokedFunc: function() {
            return this.name;
        }(), // this property will be set to the return value of this anonymous function,
        // which is invoked during the object definition;
        // basically, it's a way to check the context inside of an object, at this moment

        innerObj: {
            name: "inner object",
            innerArrowFunc: () => {
                return this.name;
            } // the context inside a nested object is not the parent, it's still
            // the global object. entering an object definition doesn't change the context
        },

        let otherObj = {
            name: "my other object"
        }
    // call unboundFunc on obj, we get "my object" console.log("unboundFunc: ", obj.unboundFunc()); // => "my object" // assign unboundFunc to a variable and call it let newFunc = obj.unboundFunc; // this newFunc will default to being called on global object console.log("newFunc: ",newFunc()); // => undefined // but you could bind it directly to a different object if you wanted console.log("newFunc: ", newFunc.bind(otherObj)()); // "my other object"
    // meanwhile, obj.boundToGlobal will only ever be called on global object console.log("boundToGlobal: ", obj.boundToGlobal()); //=> undefined let newBoundFunc = obj.boundToGlobal; console.log("newBoundFunc: ", newBoundFunc()); // => undefined // even if you try to directly bind to another object, it won't work! console.log("newBoundFunc: ", newBoundFunc.bind(otherObj)()); // => undefined
    // let's make a new function that will always be bound to the context // where we call our function maker let boundFunc = obj.makeFuncBoundToObj();// note that we're invoking, not just assigning console.log("boundFunc: ", boundFunc()); // => "my object" // we can't rebind this function console.log("boundFunc: ", boundFunc.bind(otherObj)()) // =>"my object"
    // but if I call makeFuncBoundToObj on another context // the new bound function is stuck with that other context let boundToOther = obj.makeFuncBoundToObj.bind(otherObj)(); console.log("boundToOther: ", boundToOther()); // => "my other object" console.log("boundToOther: ", boundToOther.bind(obj)()) // "my other object"
    // the return value of my immediately invoked function // shows that the context inside of the object is the // global object, not the object itself // context only changes inside a function that is called // on an object console.log("immediatelyInvokedFunc: ", obj.immediatelyInvokedFunc); // => undefined
    // even though we're inside a nested object, the context is // still the same as it was outside the outer object // in this case, the global object console.log("innerArrowFunc: ", obj.innerObj.innerArrowFunc()); // => undefined

    }

    -Implement a closure and explain how the closure effects scope
        -
        a closure is "the combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared" -
        alternatively, "when an inner function uses or changes variables in an outer function" -
        closures have access to any variables within their own scope + scope of outer functions + global scope— the set of all these available variables is "lexical environemnt" -
        closure keeps reference to all variables ** even
    if the outer
    function has returned **
        -each
    function has a private mutable state that cannot be accessed externally
        -
        the inner
    function will maintain a reference to the scope in which it was declared.so it has access to variables that were initialized in any outer scope— even
    if that scope
        -
        if a variable exists in the scope of what could have been accessed by a
    function(e.g.global scope, outer
        function, etc), does that variable wind up in the closure even
    if it never got accessed ?
        -
        if you change the value of a variable(e.g.i++) you will change the value of that variable in the scope that it was declared in

        ``
    `javascript
    function createCounter() {
       // this function starts a counter at 0, then returns a
       // new function that can access and change that counter
       //
       // each new counter you create will have a single internal
       // state, that can be changed only by calling the function.
       // you can't access that state from outside of the function,
       // even though the count variable in question is initialized
       // by the outer function, and it remains accessible to the
       // inner function after the outer function returns.
       let count = 0;
       return function() {
          count ++;
          return count;
       }
    }

    let counter = createCounter();
    console.log(counter()); //=> 1
    console.log(counter()); //=> 2
    // so the closure here comes into play because
    // an inner function is accessing and changing
    // a variable from an outer function

    // the closure is the combination of the counter
    // function and the all the variables that existed
    // in the scope that it was declared in. because
    // inner blocks/functions have access to outer
    // scopes, that includes the scope of the outer
    // function.

    // so counter variable is a closure, in that
    // it contains the inner count value that was
    // initialized by the outer createCounter() function
    // count has been captured or closed over

    // this state is private, so if i run createCounter again
    // i get a totally separate count that doesn't interact
    // with the previous one and each of the new functions
    // will have their own internal state based on the
    // initial declaration in the now-closed outer function

    let counter2 = createCounter();
    console.log(counter2()); // => 1

    // if i set a new function equal to my existing counter
    // the internal state is shared with the new function
    let counter3 = counter2;
    console.log(counter3());

#### Define a method that references `this` on an object literal

-   <span id="ae61">when we use `this` in a method it refers to the object that the method is invoked on</span>
-   <span id="29a2">it will let you access other pieces of information from within that object, or even other methods</span>
-   <span id="c41d">method style invocation — `object.method(args)` (e.g. built in examples like `Array#push`, or `String#toUpperCase`)</span>
-   <span id="c99d">context is set every time we invoke a function</span>
-   <span id="fa43">function style invocation sets the context to the global object no matter what</span>
-   <span id="8cc1">being inside an object does not make the context that object! you still have to use method-style invocation</span>
-   <span id="f578">Utilize the built in `Function#bind` on a callback to maintain the context of this</span>
-   <span id="26ba">when we call bind on a function, we get an exotic function back — so the context will always be the same for that new function</span>

<!-- -->

    let cat = {
      purr: function () {
      console.log("meow");
      },
      purrMore: function () {
      this.purr();
      },
      };
      let sayMeow = cat.purrMore; console.log(sayMeow()); // TypeError: this.purr is not a function

      // we can use the built in Function.bind to ensure our context, our this, // is the cat object let boundCat = sayMeow.bind(cat);
      boundCat(); // prints "meow"

    -`bind`
       can also work with arguments, so you can have a version of a
       function with particular arguments and a particular context.the first arg will be the context aka the `this`
       you want it to use.the next arguments will be the functions arguments that you are binding -
           if you just want to bind it to those arguments in particular, you can use `null`
       as the first argument, so the context won 't be bound, just the arguments -
           Given a code snippet, identify what `this`
       refers to
           -
           important to recognize the difference between scope and context -
           scope works like a dictionary that has all the variables that are available within a given block, plus a pointer back the next outer scope(which itself has pointers to new scopes until you reach the global scope.so you can think about a whole given block 's scope as a kind of linked list of dictionaries) (also, this is not to say that scope is actually implemented in this way, that is just the schema that i can use to understand it) -
               context refers to the value of the `this`
               keyword -
               the keyword `this`
               exists in every
               function and it evaluates to the object that is currently invoking that
               function -so the context is fairly straightforward when we talk about methods being called on specific objects -
               you could, however, call an object 's method on something other than that object, and then this would refer to the context where/how it was called, e.g.
               ``
               `javascript
    let dog = {
       name: "Bowser",
       changeName: function () {
          this.name = "Layla";
      },
    };

    // note this is **not invoked** - we are assigning the function itself
    let change = dog.changeName;
    console.log(change()); // undefined

    // our dog still has the same name
    console.log(dog); // { name: 'Bowser', changeName: [Function: changeName] }

    // instead of changing the dog we changed the global name!!!
    console.log(this); // Object [global] {etc, etc, etc,  name: 'Layla'}

### CALLING SOMETHING IN THE WRONG CONTEXT CAN MESS YOU UP!

-   <span id="b960">could throw an error if it expects this to have some other method or whatever that doesn’t exist</span>
-   <span id="1880">you could also overwrite values or assign values to exist in a space where they should not exist</span>
-   <span id="c9f0">if you call a function as a callback, it will set `this` to be the outer function itself, even if the function you were calling is a method that was called on a particular object</span>

      },
      };
      global.setTimeout(cat.purrMore, 5000); // 5 seconds later: TypeError: this.purr is not a function

we can use strict mode with `"use strict";` this will prevent you from accessing the global object with `this` in functions, so if you try to call `this` in the global context and change a value, you will get a type error, and the things you try to access will be undefined

    POJOs
    1. Label variables as either Primitive vs. Reference
    Javascript considers most data types to be ‘primitive’, these data types are immutable, and are passed by value. The more complex data types: Array and Object are mutable, are considered ‘reference’ data types, and are passed by reference.

    Boolean — Primitive
    Null — Primitive
    Undefined — Primitive
    Number — Primitive
    String — Primitive
    Array — Reference
    Object — Reference
    Function — Reference

    2. Identify when to use . vs [] when accessing values of an object
    let obj = {
        "one": 1,
        "two": 2
    };
    // Choose the square brackets property accessor when the property name is determined at
    // runtime, or if the property name is not a valid identifier
    let myKey = "one";
    console.log(obj[myKey]);
    // Choose the dot property accessor when the property name is known ahead of time.

    console.log(obj.two);
    3. Write an object literal with a variable key using interpolation
    let keyName = "two";
    // If the key is not known, you can use an alternative [] syntax for

    // object initialization only

    let obj2 = {

    [keyName]: 2

    }

    console.log(obj2);
    4. Use the obj[key] !== undefined pattern to check if a given variable that contains a key exists in an object
    function doesKeyExist(obj, key) {
        // obj[key] !== undefined
        // or:
        return key in obj;
    }
    let course = {

    bootcamp: 'Lambda',

    course: 'Bootcamp Prep'

    }

    console.log(doesKeyExist(course, 'course')); // => true

    console.log(doesKeyExist(course, 'name')); // => false
    5. Utilize Object.keys and Object.values in a function
    function printKeys(object) {
        return Object.keys(object);
    }
    function printValues(object) {
    return Object.values(object);
    }
    console.log(printKeys({

    dog: "Strelka",

    dog2: "Belka"

    }));

    console.log(printValues({

    dog: "Strelka",

    dog2: "Belka"

    }));
    6. Iterate through an object using a for in loop
    let player = {
        name: "Sergey",
        skill: "hockey"
    };
    for (let key in player) {
    console.log(key, player[key]);
    }
    console.log(Object.entries(player));
    7. Define a function that utilizes …rest syntax to accept an arbitrary number of arguments
    function restSum(...otherNums) {
        let sum = 0;
        console.log(otherNums);
        otherNums.forEach(function(num) {
            sum += num;
        });
    return sum;

    }
    console.log(restSum(3, 5, 6)); // => 14

    console.log(restSum(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)); // => 45

    console.log(restSum(0)); // => 0
    8. Use …spread syntax for Object literals and Array literals
    let numArray = [1, 2, 3];
    let moreNums = [...numArray, 4, 5, 6]
    console.log(moreNums);
    let shoe = {
    color: "red",
    size: 10
    };
    let newShoe = {
    ...shoe,
    brand: "Nike",
    size: 12
    };
    console.log(newShoe);
    newShoe.color = "black";
    console.log(newShoe);
    console.log(shoe);
    9. Destructure an array to reference specific elements
    let arr = ['one', 'two', 'three'];
    let [first] = arr;

    console.log(first);
    10. Destructure an object to reference specific values
    let me = {
        name: "Ian",
        instruments: ['bass', 'synth', 'guitar'],
        siblings: {
            brothers: ['Alistair'],
            sisters: ['Meghan']
        }
    }
    let {
    name,
    instruments: musical_instruments,
    siblings: {
    sisters
    }
    } = me;
    console.log(name);

    console.log(musical_instruments);

    console.log(sisters);
    11. Write a function that accepts a string as an argument and returns an object representing the count of each character in the array
    function charCount(inputString) {
    let res = inputString.split(&quot;&quot;).reduce(function(accum, el) {
        if (el in accum) {
            accum[el] = accum[el] + 1;
        } else {
            accum[el] = 1;
        }
        return accum;
    }, {})
    return res;

    }
    console.log(charCount('aaabbbeebbcdkjfalksdfjlkasdfasdfiiidkkdingds'));
    Review of Concepts
    1. Identify the difference between const, let, and var declarations
    2. Explain the difference between const, let, and var declarations
    var a = "a";

-   <span id="2dba">`var` is the historical keyword used for variable declaration.</span>
-   <span id="50d3">`var` declares variables in function scope, or global scope if not inside a function.</span>
-   <span id="4bc8">We consider `var` to be deprecated and it is never used in this course.</span>

<!-- -->

    let b = "b";

-   <span id="8bab">`let` is the keyword we use most often for variable declaration.</span>
-   <span id="0642">`let` declares variables in block scope.</span>
-   <span id="bf7b">variables declared with `let` are re-assignable.</span>

<!-- -->

    const c = "c";

-   <span id="e199">`const` is a specialized form of `let` that can only be used to **initialize** a variable.</span>
-   <span id="4522">Except when it is declared, you cannot assign to a `const` variable.</span>
-   <span id="4e5a">`const` scopes variables the same way that `let` does.</span>

#### 3. Predict the evaluation of code that utilizes function scope, block scope, lexical scope, and scope chaining

Consider this `run` function, inside which `foo` and `bar` have `function         scope` . `i` and `baz` are scoped to the block expression.

    // function and block scope in this example
    function run() {
        var foo = "Foo";
        let bar = "Bar";
    console.log(foo, bar);

    {
        console.log(foo);
        let baz = &quot;Bazz&quot;;
        console.log(baz);
    }

    console.log(baz); // ReferenceError

    }
    run();
    Notice that referencing baz from outside it’s block results in JavaScript throwing a ReferenceError.
    Consider this run function, inside of which foo has function scope .
    function run() {
        console.log(foo); // undefined
        var foo = "Foo";
        console.log(foo); // Foo
    }
    run();
    Consider this func1 function and it’s nested scopes.
    // global scope
    function func1(arg1) {
        // func1 scope
    return function func2(arg2) {
        // func2 scope

        return function func3(arg3) {
            // func3 scope

            console.log(arg1, arg2, arg3);
        }
    }

    }
    6. Implement a closure and explain how the closure effects scope
    const adder = (arg1) => {
        return (arg2) => {
            return arg1 + arg2;
        }
    };
    const func2 = adder(2);

    const result = func2(2);

    console.log(result); // => 4;
    4. Define an arrow function
    const returnValue = (val) => val;

This simple construct will create a function that accepts `val` as a parameter, and returns `val` immediately. We do not need to type `return val` , because this is a single-line function.

Identically, we could write

    const returnValue = (val) => {
        return val;
    };

#### 5. Given an arrow function, deduce the value of `this` without executing the code

    function fDAdder(arr) {
        console.log(this);
    return arr.reduce((acc, ele) =&gt; {
        return acc + ele;
    });

    };
    fDAdder([1, 2, 4, 6]);
    If we use a function declaration style function, the this variable is set to the global object (i.e. Object [global] in Node. JS and Window in your browser).
    const adder = (arr) => {
        console.log(this);
        arr.reduce((acc, ele) => sum += ele);
    };
    adder([1, 2, 4, 6]);

In this example, we use a fat arrow style function. Note that when we declare a functions like this `this` becomes

#### 7. Define a method that references this on an object literal

    const pokemon = {
        firstname: 'Pika',
        lastname: 'Chu',
        getPokeName: function() {
            const fullname = `${this.firstname} ${this.lastname}`;
            return fullname;
        }
    };
    console.log(pokemon.getPokeName());
    8. Utilize the built in Function#bind on a callback to maintain the context of this
    const pokemon = {
        firstname: 'Pika',
        lastname: 'Chu',
        getPokeName: function() {
            const fullname = `${this.firstname} ${this.lastname}`;
            return fullname;
        }
    };
    const logPokemon = pokemon.getPokename.bind(pokemon);
    logPokemon('sushi', 'algorithms'); // Pika Chu loves sushi and algorithms
    9. Given a code snippet, identify what this refers to
    function Person(name) {
        // this.name = name; 
        // let that = this;
    setTimeout(function() {
        // console.log(this); // =&gt; Window
        // console.log(that); // =&gt; [Function] =&gt; Person
        // this.sayName(); // =&gt; no method error
        that.sayName();
    }, 1000);

    }
    Person.prototype.sayName = function() {
    console.log(this.name);
    };
    const jane = new Person("Jane");

    Getting Comfortable With Python:
    Objective 04 - Use a print statement

    Getting Comfortable With Python:
    Objective 04 - Use a print statement
    Overview
    Learning to use the print function in Python is the perfect way to start writing Python code. When learning to write in any new programming language, one of the first things you want to do is get some output from your program. The print function is how you output the value of an object to the screen. You will learn how to use the print function in Python.
    Follow Along
    Using print with different objects
    Let’s start by executing the print function to print different types of objects in Python. There are numerous types of objects that you can print using the print function.
    Using print with no arguments:
    >>> print()
    >>>
    Notice the empty line after calling the print function. The default end value when calling print is the newline character \\n.
    Using print with a string literal:
    >>> print("Lambda School is awesome!")
    Lambda School is awesome!
    >>>

Notice how calling `print` with the string literal printed the exact string we passed in onto the screen.

Using `print` with a variable:

    >>> slogan = "i love lamp"
    >>> print(slogan)
    i love lamp
    >>>

Notice how calling `print` with the `slogan` variable prints the value assigned to the `slogan` variable.

Using `print` with an expression:

    >>> superlative = "wonderful"
    >>> school = "Lambda School"
    >>> print(school + " is " + superlative)
    Lambda School is wonderful
    >>>

Notice how the argument for the `print` function can be an expression. Once the expression is resolved to a string object, the `print` function can output it to the screen.

Using `print` with other object types:

    print(2020)
    2020
    >>> print(123.456)
    123.456
    >>> print(False)
    False
    >>> print(["Lambda", "School", 2, 0, 2, 0])
    ['Lambda', 'School', 2, 0, 2, 0]
    >>> print(("Lambda", "School"))
    ('Lambda', 'School')
    >>> print({"school": "Lambda School", "year": 2020})
    {'school': 'Lambda School', 'year': 2020}
    >>>

Any object passed as an argument into `print` will get converted into a string type before outputted to the screen.

You can see how the `print` function is easy to use and how it can handle any object type that you pass into it.

### Passing multiple arguments into `print`

Now, let’s look at how we can pass multiple arguments into the `print` function. Using `print` with multiple arguments gives you a flexible and easy way to output items to the screen.

We can pass multiple objects, all of the same or different types, into `print`.

    >>> print("Lambda School", 2020, True)
    Lambda School 2020 True
    >>>

Notice how each object we passed in was converted to a string and then output to the screen. Notice also that `print` used `" "` as the default separator value.

We can change the separator value by assigning a value to the keyword argument `sep`.

    >>> print("Lambda School", 2020, True, sep="!!!")
    Lambda School!!!2020!!!True
    >>> print("Lambda School", 2020, True, sep="\\t")
    Lambda School   2020    True
    >>> print("Lambda School", 2020, True, sep="\\n")
    Lambda School
    2020
    True
    >>> print("Lambda School", 2020, True, sep="")
    Lambda School2020True
    >>>

### Specifying the `end` value with `print`

You can also specify the `end` value by assigning a value to the `end` keyword argument when you call the `print` function. Being able to print a value to the screen but allow the user to stay on the same line is useful and necessary in some cases.

Here is how you can change the default `end` value (which is `\\n`) when calling the `print` function.

    >>> print("Are you a Lambda School student?", end=" (Y or N)")
    Are you a Lambda School student? (Y or N)>>>

Customizing the `end` value when calling the `print` function can be useful and necessary in some circumstances.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

You have now learned the basics of using the `print` function in Python. You learned how to call the `print` function to print objects of different types. You now know how to use `print` with multiple positional arguments. In certain necessary situations, you also know how to change the default `end` value when calling the `print` function.

Now, get some practice using the `print` function by completing the challenge below.

### Objective 05 - Use white space to denote blocks

### Overview

Python is unique because indentation instead of some other character marks blocks of code. A block of code is a collection of statements that are grouped. The syntax for denoting blocks varies from language to language. For example, in C, blocks are delimited by curly braces (`{` and `}`). Understanding how Python uses whitespace and indentation to denote logical lines and code blocks is essential.

### Follow Along

### Whitespace Characters

Whitespace is any character represented by something that appears empty (usually `\\t` or `"         "`). The characters that Python considers to be whitespace can be seen by printing out the value of `string.whitespace` from the `string` library.

    >>> import string
    >>> string.whitespace
    ' \\t\\n\\r\\x0b\\x0c'
    >>>

Notice the characters are `" "` (space), `\\t` (tab), `\\n` (newline), `\\r` (return), `\\x0b` (unicode line tabulation), and `\\x0c` (unicode form feed).

You’ve seen the different types of whitespace characters that can appear, but you mainly need to concern yourself with `" "`, `\\t`, and `\\n`.

### Logical Lines of Code

Whitespace is used to denote the end of a logical line of code. In Python, a logical line of code’s end (a statement or a definition) is marked by a `\\n`.

    >>> first = "Lambda"
    >>> second = "School"
    >>> first + second
    'LambdaSchool'
    >>> first \\
    ... + \\
    ... second
    'LambdaSchool'
    >>>

Notice how the REPL evaluates the expression `first + second` when I return on line 3. Below that, I can write one logical line of code over multiple lines by ending each line with a `\\` character. That `\\` character lets the Python interpreter that even though there is a newline, you don’t want it to treat it as the end of a logical line.

It’s important to understand that Python assumes meaning in newline characters when trying to interpret your code.

### Code Blocks

Whitespace (indentation) can denote code blocks. Python gives meaning to the amount of whitespace (indentation level) that comes before a logical line of code.

    >>> if True:
    ... if True:
      File "<stdin>", line 2
        if True:
        ^
    IndentationError: expected an indented block
    >>>

    kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap
    Purpose of these Roadmaps

    The purpose of these roadmaps is to give you an idea about the landscape and to guide you if you are confused about what to learn next and not to encourage you to pick what is hip and trendy. You should grow some understanding of why one tool would be better suited for some cases than the other and remember hip and trendy never means best suited for the job.

    Note to Beginners

    These roadmaps cover everything that is there to learn for the paths listed below. Don’t feel overwhelmed, you don’t need to learn it all in the beginning if you are just getting started. We are working on the beginner versions of these and will release it soon after we are done with the 2021 release of the Backend and DevOps roadmaps.


    If you think that these can be improved in any way, please do suggest.

    Fluency on the command line is a skill often neglected or considered arcane, but it improves your flexibility and productivity as an engineer in both obvious and subtle ways. This is a selection of notes and tips on using the command-line that we’ve found useful when working on Linux. Some tips are elementary, and some are fairly specific, sophisticated, or obscure. This page is not long, but if you can use and recall all the items here, you know a lot.
    This work is the result of many authors and translators. Some of this originally appeared on Quora, but it has since moved to GitHub, where people more talented than the original author have made numerous improvements. Please submit a question if you have a question related to the command line. Please contribute if you see an error or something that could be better!

This repository serves as a directory of some of the best papers the community can find, bringing together documents scattered across the web. You can also visit the Papers We Love site for more info.
    Due to licenses we cannot always host the papers themselves (when we do, you will see a 📜 emoji next to its title in the directory README) but we can provide links to their locations.
    If you enjoy the papers, perhaps stop by a local chapter meetup and join in on the vibrant discussions around them. You can also discuss PWL events, the content in this repository, and/or anything related to PWL on our Slack, after signing-up to join it, or on our #paperswelove IRC channel on freenode.

    free-for.dev
    Developers and Open Source authors now have a massive amount of services offering free tiers, but it can be hard to find them all to make informed decisions.
    This is a list of software (SaaS, PaaS, IaaS, etc.) and other offerings that have free tiers for developers.
    The scope of this particular list is limited to things that infrastructure developers (System Administrator, DevOps Practitioners, etc.) are likely to find useful. We love all the free services out there, but it would be good to keep it on topic. It’s a bit of a grey line at times so this is a bit opinionated; do not be offended if I do not accept your contribution.
    This list is the result of Pull Requests, reviews, ideas and work done by 900+ people. You too can help by sending Pull Requests to add more services or by remove ones whose offerings have changed or been retired.
    NOTE: This list is only for as-a-Service offerings, not for self-hosted software. For a service to be eligible it has to offer a free tier and not just a free trial. If the free tier is time-bucketed it has to be for at least a year. We also consider the free tier from a security perspective, so SSO is fine but I will not accept services that restrict TLS to paid-only tiers.

    See how the exact same Medium.com clone (called Conduit) is built using different frontends and backends. Yes, you can mix and match them, because they all adhere to the same API spec 😮😎
    While most “todo” demos provide an excellent cursory glance at a framework’s capabilities, they typically don’t convey the knowledge & perspective required to actually build real applications with it.
    RealWorld solves this by allowing you to choose any frontend (React, Angular 2, & more) and any backend (Node, Django, & more) and see how they power a real world, beautifully designed fullstack app called “Conduit”.
    Read the full blog post announcing RealWorld on Medium.
    Implementations
    Over 100 implementations have been created using various languages, libraries, and frameworks.
    See the list of implementations on the CodebaseShow website >>>
    Create a new implementation

    Or you can view upcoming implementations (WIPs).
    How do I get up & running?
    Follow the instructions in the README of whatever frontend and/or backend repo’s you want to get up and running.
    Can you teach me how to build each stack from scratch?
    Yup! We’ve built step-by-step tutorials for all of our stacks that teach you how to go from git init all the way to the production ready application. Start learning now >>>
    Community created resources
    Forks, tutorials, workshops, and other resources based on the RealWorld project:

    RealWorld React/NodeJS E2E Tests by Anish Karandikar
    A repo showing how to wire React frontend with NodeJS backend for a RealWorld fullstack
    Includes E2E integration tests that use Chrome Puppeteer and Mocha and work with CI systems like Travis CI and CircleCI

    thedaviddias/Front-End-Checklist



    Front-End Checklist
    The Front-End Checklist is an exhaustive list of all elements you need to have / to test before launching your website / HTML page to production.
    How To Use • Contributing • Website • Product Hunt
    Other Checklists:

     🎮 Front-End Performance Checklist • 💎 Front-End Design Checklist
    It is based on Front-End developers’ years of experience, with the additions coming from some other open-source checklists.

    How to use?
    All items in the Front-End Checklist are required for the majority of the projects, but some elements can be omitted or are not essential (in the case of an administration web app, you may not need RSS feed for example). We choose to use 3 levels of flexibility:

    means that the item is recommended but can be omitted in some particular situations.
    means that the item is highly recommended and can eventually be omitted in some really particular cases. Some elements, if omitted, can have bad repercussions in terms of performance or SEO.
    means that the item can’t be omitted by any reason. You may cause a dysfunction in your page or have accessibility or SEO issues. The testing priority needs to be on these elements first.

    Some resources possess an emoticon to help you understand which type of content / help you may find on the checklist:

    📖: documentation or article
    🛠: online tool / testing tool
    📹: media or video content


    You can contribute to the Front-End Checklist App reading the CONTRIBUTING.md file which explains everything about the project.

    Graph Data Structure Interview Questions At A Glance
    Because they’re just about the most important data structure there is.



    Graphs
    graph: collections of data represented by nodes and connections between nodes

    graphs: way to formally represent network; ordered pairs

    graphs: modeling relations between many items; Facebook friends (you = node; friendship = edge; bidirectional); twitter = unidirectional

    graph theory: study of graphs

    big O of graphs: G = V(E)
    trees are a type of graph
    Components required to make a graph:

    nodes or vertices: represent objects in a dataset (cities, animals, web pages)
    edges: connections between vertices; can be bidirectional
    weight: cost to travel across an edge; optional (aka cost)

    Useful for:

    maps
    networks of activity
    anything you can represent as a network
    multi-way relational data

    Types of Graphs:

    directed: can only move in one direction along edges; which direction indicated by arrows
    undirected: allows movement in both directions along edges; bidirectional
    cyclic: weighted; edges allow you to revisit at least 1 vertex; example weather
    acyclical: vertices can only be visited once; example recipe

    Two common ways to represent graphs in code:

    adjacency lists: graph stores list of vertices; for each vertex, it stores list of connected vertices
    adjacency matrices: two-dimensional array of lists with built-in edge weights; denotes no relationship

    Both have strengths and weaknesses.



    Questions
    What is a Graph?
    A Graph is a data structure that models objects and pairwise relationships between them with nodes and edges. For example: Users and friendships, locations and paths between them, parents and children, etc.
    Why is it important to learn Graphs?
    Graphs represent relationships between data. Anytime you can identify a relationship pattern, you can build a graph and often gain insights through a traversal. These insights can be very powerful, allowing you to find new relationships, like users who have a similar taste in music or purchasing.
    How many types of graphs are there?
    Graphs can be directed or undirected, cyclic or acyclic, weighted or unweighted. They can also be represented with different underlying structures including, but not limited to, adjacency lists, adjacency matrices, object and pointers, or a custom solution.
    What is the time complexity (big-O) to add/remove/get a vertex/edge for a graph?
    It depends on the implementation. (Graph Representations). Before choosing an implementation, it is wise to consider the tradeoffs and complexities of the most commonly used operations.
    Graph Representations
    The two most common ways to represent graphs in code are adjacency lists and adjacency matrices, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. When deciding on a graph implementation, it’s important to understand the type of data and operations you will be using.



    Adjacency List
    In an adjacency list, the graph stores a list of vertices and for each vertex, a list of each vertex to which it’s connected. So, for the following graph…
    …an adjacency list in Python could look something like this:
    class Graph:
        def __init__(self):
            self.vertices = {
                              "A": {"B"},
                              "B": {"C", "D"},
                              "C": {"E"},
                              "D": {"F", "G"},
                              "E": {"C"},
                              "F": {"C"},
                              "G": {"A", "F"}
                            }

Note that this adjacency list doesn’t actually use any lists. The `vertices` collection is a `dictionary` which lets us access each collection of edges in O(1) constant time while the edges are contained in a `set` which lets us check for the existence of edges in O(1) constant time.

### Adjacency Matrix

Now, let’s see what this graph might look like as an adjacency matrix:

    class Graph:
        def __init__(self):
            self.edges = [[0,1,0,0,0,0,0],
                          [0,0,1,1,0,0,0],
                          [0,0,0,0,1,0,0],
                          [0,0,0,0,0,1,1],
                          [0,0,1,0,0,0,0],
                          [0,0,1,0,0,0,0],
                          [1,0,0,0,0,1,0]]

We represent this matrix as a two-dimensional array, or a list of lists. With this implementation, we get the benefit of built-in edge weights but do not have an association between the values of our vertices and their index.

In practice, both of these would probably contain more information by including Vertex or Edge classes.

### Tradeoffs

Both adjacency matrices and adjacency lists have their own strengths and weaknesses. Let’s explore their tradeoffs.

For the following:

    V: Total number of vertices in the graph
    E: Total number of edges in the graph
    e: Average number of edges per vertex

#### Space Complexity

-   <span id="f8f8">**Adjacency Matrix**: O(V ^ 2)</span>
-   <span id="1946">**Adjacency List**: O(V + E)</span>

Consider a sparse graph with 100 vertices and only one edge. An adjacency list would have to store all 100 vertices but only needs to keep track of that single edge. The adjacency matrix would need to store 100x100=10,000 possible connections, even though all but one would be 0.

Now consider a dense graph where each vertex points to each other vertex. In this case, the total number of edges will approach V² so the space complexities of each are comparable. However, dictionaries and sets are less space efficient than lists so for dense graphs, the adjacency matrix is more efficient.

Takeaway: Adjacency lists are more space efficient for **sparse** graphs while adjacency matrices become efficient for **dense** graphs.

#### Add Vertex

-   <span id="6257">**Adjacency Matrix**: O(V)</span>
-   <span id="6a8f">**Adjacency List**: O(1)</span>

Adding a vertex is extremely simple in an adjacency list:

    self.vertices["H"] = set()

Adding a new key to a dictionary is a constant-time operation.

For an adjacency matrix, we would need to add a new value to the end of each existing row, then add a new row at the end.

    for v in self.edges:
      self.edges[v].append(0)
    v.append([0] * len(self.edges + 1))

Remember that with Python lists, appending to the end of a list is usually O(1) due to over-allocation of memory but can be O(n) when the over-allocated memory fills up. When this occurs, adding the vertex can be O(V²).

Takeaway: Adding vertices is very efficient in adjacency lists but very inefficient for adjacency matrices.

#### Remove Vertex

-   <span id="8226">**Adjacency Matrix**: O(V ^ 2)</span>
-   <span id="85fd">**Adjacency List**: O(V)</span>

Removing vertices is pretty inefficient in both representations. In an adjacency matrix, we need to remove the removed vertex’s row, then remove that column from each other row. Removing an element from a list requires moving everything after that element over by one slot which takes an average of V/2 operations. Since we need to do that for every single row in our matrix, that results in a V² time complexity. On top of that, we need to reduce the index of each vertex after our removed index by 1 as well which doesn’t add to our quadratic time complexity, but does add extra operations.

For an adjacency list, we need to visit each vertex and remove all edges pointing to our removed vertex. Removing elements from sets and dictionaries is a O(1) operation, so this results in an overall O(V) time complexity.

Takeaway: Removing vertices is inefficient in both adjacency matrices and lists but more inefficient in matrices.

#### Add Edge

-   <span id="dbbe">**Adjacency Matrix**: O(1)</span>
-   <span id="3968">**Adjacency List**: O(1)</span>

Adding an edge in an adjacency matrix is quite simple:

    self.edges[v1][v2] = 1

Adding an edge in an adjacency list is similarly simple:

    self.vertices[v1].add(v2)

Both are constant-time operations.

Takeaway: Adding edges to both adjacency lists and matrices is very efficient.

#### Remove Edge

-   <span id="b417">**Adjacency Matrix**: O(1)</span>
-   <span id="d794">**Adjacency List**: O(1)</span>

Removing an edge from an adjacency matrix is quite simple:

    self.edges[v1][v2] = 0

Removing an edge from an adjacency list is similarly simple:

    self.vertices[v1].remove(v2)

Both are constant-time operations.

Takeaway: Removing edges from both adjacency lists and matrices is very efficient.

#### Find Edge

-   <span id="dc68">**Adjacency Matrix**: O(1)</span>
-   <span id="2b87">**Adjacency List**: O(1)</span>

Finding an edge in an adjacency matrix is quite simple:

    return self.edges[v1][v2] > 0

Finding an edge in an adjacency list is similarly simple:

    return v2 in self.vertices[v1]

Both are constant-time operations.

Takeaway: Finding edges from both adjacency lists and matrices is very efficient.

#### Get All Edges from Vertex

-   <span id="798e">**Adjacency Matrix**: O(V)</span>
-   <span id="fa79">**Adjacency List**: O(1)</span>

Say you want to know all the edges originating from a particular vertex. With an adjacency list, this is as simple as returning the value from the vertex dictionary:

    return self.vertex[v]

In an adjacency matrix, however, it’s a bit more complicated. You would need to iterate through the entire row and populate a list based on the results:

    v_edges = []
    for v2 in self.edges[v]:
        if self.edges[v][v2] > 0:
            v_edges.append(v2)
    return v_edges

Takeaway: Fetching all edges is more efficient in an adjacency list than an adjacency matrix.

### Breadth-First Search

Can use breadth-first search when searching a graph; explores graph outward in rings of increasing distance from starting vertex; never attempts to explore vertex it is or has already explored

#### BFS

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*WOvrysI4fX6ePqN-.gif" class="graf-image" /></figure>### Applications of BFS

-   <span id="149a">pathfinding, routing</span>
-   <span id="9ab5">web crawlers</span>
-   <span id="31af">find neighbor nodes in P2P network</span>
-   <span id="13aa">finding people/connections away on social network</span>
-   <span id="4f5f">find neighboring locations on graph</span>
-   <span id="d1b5">broadcasting on a network</span>
-   <span id="4061">cycle detection in a graph</span>
-   <span id="0f7f">finding connected components</span>
-   <span id="a86f">solving several theoretical graph problems</span>

### Coloring BFS

It’s useful to color vertexes as you arrive at them and as you leave them behind as already searched.

**unlisted**: white  
**vertices whose neighbors are being explored**: gray  
**vertices with no unexplored neighbors**: black

### BFS Pseudocode

    def BFS(graph, start_vert):
        for v of graph.vertices:
            v.color = white
        start_vert.color = gray
        queue.enqueue(start_vert)
        while !queue isEmpty():
        # peek at head but don't dequeue
        u = queue[0]
        for v of u.neighbors:
            if v.color == white:
                v.color == gray
                queue.enqueue(v)
        queue.dequeue()
        u.color = black

### BFS Steps

1.  <span id="ccee">Mark graph vertices white.</span>
2.  <span id="26e7">Mark starting vertex gray.</span>
3.  <span id="863c">Enqueue starting vertex.</span>
4.  <span id="b8d8">Check if queue is not empty.</span>
5.  <span id="2dc5">If not empty, peek at first item in queue.</span>
6.  <span id="0e5c">Loop through that vertex’s neighbors.</span>
7.  <span id="1a9e">Check if unvisited.</span>
8.  <span id="7165">If unvisited, mark as gray and enqueue vertex.</span>
9.  <span id="338b">Dequeue current vertex and mark as black.</span>
10. <span id="8460">Repeat until all vertices are explored.</span>

### Depth-First Search

dives down the graph as far as it can before backtracking and exploring another branch; never attempts to explore a vertex it has already explored or is in the process of exploring; exact order will vary depending on which branches get taken first and which is starting vertex

#### DFS:

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*DZVdn1kWaiJXQ_zc.gif" class="graf-image" /></figure>### Applications of DFS

-   <span id="044e">preferred method for exploring a graph if we want to ensure we visit every node in graph</span>
-   <span id="b086">finding minimum spanning trees of weighted graphs</span>
-   <span id="c419">pathfinding</span>
-   <span id="281e">detecting cycles in graphs</span>
-   <span id="6739">solving and generating mazes</span>
-   <span id="20b5">topological sorting, useful for scheduling sequences of dependent jobs</span>

### DFS Pseudocode

    # recursion
    def explore(graph):
        visit(this_vert)
        explore(remaining_graph)
    iterative
    def DFS(graph):
    for v of graph.verts:
    v.color = white
    v.parent = null
    for v of graph.verts:
    if v.color == white:
    DFS_visit(v)
    def DFS_visit(v):

    v.color = gray

    for neighbor of v.adjacent_nodes:

    if neighbor.color == white:

    neighbor.parent = v

    DFS_visit(neighbor)

    v.color = black
    DFS Steps

    Take graph as parameter.
    Marks all vertices as unvisited.
    Sets vertex parent as null.
    Passes each unvisited vertex into DFS_visit().
    Mark current vertex as gray.
    Loops through its unvisited neighbors.
    Sets parent and makes recursive call to DFS_visit().
    Marks vertex as black.
    Repeat until done.

    Connected Components
    connected components: in a disjoint graph, groups of nodes on a graph that are connected with each other
    Uses

    typically very large graphs, networks
    social networks
    networks (which devices can reach one another)
    epidemics (how spread, who started, where next)

    key to finding connected components: searching algorithms, breadth-first search
    How to find connected componnents

    for each node in graph:
    has it been explored
    if no, do BFS
    all nodes reached are connected
    if yes, already in connected component
    go to next node

    strongly connected components: any node in this group can get to any other node
    Bonus Python Question:
    '''
    This Bellman-Ford Code is for determination whether we can get
    shortest path from given graph or not for single-source shortest-paths problem.
    In other words, if given graph has any negative-weight cycle that is reachable
    from the source, then it will give answer False for "no solution exits".
    For argument graph, it should be a dictionary type
    such as
    graph = {
    'a': {'b': 6, 'e': 7},
    'b': {'c': 5, 'd': -4, 'e': 8},
    'c': {'b': -2},
    'd': {'a': 2, 'c': 7},
    'e': {'b': -3}
    }
    Review of Concepts:




    A graph is any collection of nodes and edges.
    A graph is a less restrictive class of collections of nodes than structures like a tree.
    It doesn’t need to have a root node (not every node needs to be accessible from a single node)
    It can have cycles (a group of nodes whose paths begin and end at the same node)




    Cycles in a graph



    Cycles are not always “isolated”, they can be one part of a larger graph. You can detect them by starting your search on a specific node and finding a path that takes you back to that same node.





    Any number of edges may leave a given node
    A Path is a sequence of nodes on a graph

    Undirected Graph
    Undirected Graph: An undirected graph is one where the edges do not specify a particular direction. The edges are bi-directional.
    Types:



    Dense Graph

    Dense Graph — A graph with lots of edges.
    “Dense graphs have many edges. But, wait! ⚠️ I know what you must be thinking, how can you determine what qualifies as “many edges”? This is a little bit too subjective, right? ? I agree with you, so let’s quantify it a little bit:
    Let’s find the maximum number of edges in a directed graph. If there are |V| nodes in a directed graph (in the example below, six nodes), that means that each node can have up to |v| connections (in the example below, six connections).
    Why? Because each node could potentially connect with all other nodes and with itself (see “loop” below). Therefore, the maximum number of edges that the graph can have is |V|\*|V| , which is the total number of nodes multiplied by the maximum number of connections that each node can have.”
    When the number of edges in the graph is close to the maximum number of edges, the graph is dense.

    Sparse Graph

    Sparse Graph — Few edges
    When the number of edges in the graph is significantly fewer than the maximum number of edges, the graph is sparse.

    Weighted Graph

    Weighted Graph — Edges have a cost or a weight to traversal

    Directed Graph

    Directed Graph — Edges only go one direction

    Undirected Graph

    Undirected Graph — Edges don’t have a direction. All graphs are assumed to be undirected unless otherwise stated

    Node Class
    Uses a class to define the neighbors as properties of each node.
    Adjacency Matrix
    The row index will correspond to the source of an edge and the column index will correspond to the edges destination.

    When the edges have a direction, matrix[i][j] may not be the same as matrix[j][i]
    It is common to say that a node is adjacent to itself so matrix[x][x] is true for any node
    Will be O(n²) space complexity




    Adjacency List
    Seeks to solve the shortcomings of the matrix implementation. It uses an object where keys represent node labels and values associated with that key are the adjacent node keys held in an array.

    HTTP Basics

    “If you want to build a ship, don’t drum up the men and women to gather wood, divide the work, and give orders. Instead, teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea.” — Antoine de Saint-Exupery;





    HTTP : Hypertext Transfer Protocol.
    HT : Hypertext - content with references to other content.
    Term used to refer to content in computing.
    What makes the Web a “web”.
    Most fundamental part of how we interact.
    Hyperlinks : Links; references between HT resources.
    TP : Transfer Protocol - set of guidelines surrounding the transmission of data.
    Defines the expectations for both ends of the transer.
    Defines some ways the transfer might fail.
    HTTP is a request/response protocol.
    HTTP works between clients & servers.
    Clients : User Agent - the data consumer.
    Servers : Origin - Data provider & where the application is running.




    Components of HTTP-based systems
    HTTP is a client-server protocol: requests are sent by one entity, the user-agent (or a proxy on behalf of it). Most of the time the user-agent is a Web browser, but it can be anything, for example a robot that crawls the Web to populate and maintain a search engine index.
    Each individual request is sent to a server, which handles it and provides an answer, called the response. Between the client and the server there are numerous entities, collectively called proxies, which perform different operations and act as gateways or caches, for example.



    Properties of HTTP

    Reliable Connections : Messages passed between a client & server sacrifice a little speed for the sake of trust.
    TCP is HTTP’s preferred connection type.
    Stateless Transfer : HTTP is a stateless protocol - meaning it does not store any kind of information.
    HTTP supports cookies.
    Intermediaries : Servers or devices that pass your request along which come in three types:


    Proxies : Modify your request so it appears to come from a different source.
    Gateways : Pretend to be the resource server you requested.
    Tunnels : Simply passes your request along.

    Common Examples: 301 Moved Permanently (resource you requested is in a totally new location) & 302 Found (indicates a temporary move)

    Status codes 400 - 499: Client Error

    Indicate problem with client’s request.
    Common Examples: 400 Bad Request (received, but could not understand) & 401 Unauthorized (resource exists but you’re not allowed to see w/o authentication) & 403 Forbidden (resource exists but you’re not allowed to see it at all ) & 404 Not Found (resource requested does not exist);

    Status codes 500 - 599: Server Error

    Indicates request was formatted correctly, but the server couldn’t do what you asked due to an internal problem.
    Common Examples: 500 Internal Server Error (Server had trouble processing) & 504 Gateway Timeout (Server timeout);

    Headers : Work just like HTTP requests.

    Common Examples:


    Location : Used by client for redirection responses.
    Content-Type : Let’s client know what format the body is in.
    Expires : When response is no longer valid
    Content-Disposition : Let’s client know how to display the response.
    Set-Cookie : Sends data back to the client to set on the cookie.
    Data : If the request is successful, the body of the response will contain the resource you have requested.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Heroku Deploy Guides & Cheatsheet Compilation

#### Heroku lets you deploy, run and manage applications written in Ruby, Node.js, Java, Python, Clojure, Scala, Go and PHP. An application is a collection of *source code* written in one of these languages, perhaps a framework, and some *dependency description* that instructs a build system as to which additional dependencies are needed in order to build and run the application.

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*gAOfoFENBTwE5mqJ.gif" class="graf-image" /></figure>#### This is a quick tutorial explaining how to get a static website hosted on Heroku.

> Heroku hosts apps on the internet, not static websites. To get it to run your static portfolio, personal blog, etc., you need to trick Heroku into thinking your website is a PHP app.

> Basic Assumptions You want to deploy some straight-up HTML, CSS, JS, maybe a few images. Nothing fancy here. You are in the root directory of your site (i.e. the directory that contains all subdirectories and files for the site) The root directory contains a main HTML page, e.g. index.html A Heroku app and remote are set up and ready to go Steps Add a file called composer.json to the root directory by running touch composer.json Add a file called index.php to the root directory by running touch index.php Rename the homepage (e.g. index.html) to home.html In index.php, add the following line: In composer.json, add the following line: {} Run git push heroku master Done! Visit your deployed single-page website, hosted by Heroku (as a fake PHP app ☺).

### Steps:

> **-heavily borrowed from this** <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-deploy-an-application-to-heroku/" class="markup--anchor markup--blockquote-anchor"><strong>free code camp article</strong></a> **by Stan Georgian.**

### 1.) Create the project

Starting with any basic boilerplate demo server with NodeJS.

Open a terminal and run the command `npm init -y` in order to create a new project. The dummy server will be written in <a href="https://expressjs.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">Express</a>, so we need to run the `npm install express` command to install this module.

Once this library is installed, we can create a new file for our project, named `app.js`.

We can start the application by running `node app.js`. Then we can try it out at the following URL `http://localhost:3000`. At this point you should see the message `Hello World` in the browser.

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*3FuViRnU9-PB5uqf.PNG" class="graf-image" /></figure>### 2.) Version Control

The next step is to choose a version control system and to place our code in a development platform in a repository.

The most popular version control system is <a href="https://git-scm.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">Git</a> along with <a href="https://github.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">Github</a> as a development platform, so that’s what we’ll use here.

On GitHub, go ahead and create a new repository for your application, like this:

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*pyHPJP0kjAV9sij1.PNG" class="graf-image" /></figure>To upload your local code into a repository, you need to run the commands that are listed on GitHub after you click `Create repository` button:

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*C7nOWV7ygqTRdqcu.PNG" class="graf-image" /></figure>**!** Before we do this, we must ignore some files. We want to upload to the repository only the code that we write, without the dependencies (the installed modules).

For that, we need to create a new file `.gitignore` and inside it write the file that we want to ignore.

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*T-9QyGzUdWvFuA-D.PNG" class="graf-image" /></figure>Now, we can write the commands listed in the picture above (the one from GitHub).

If you ran the commands correctly, then it’ll be on your repository’s page. If you refresh it you should see your files, except the one that you explicitly ignored, namely `node modules`.

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*_WzaY9T9A0FsvPgb.PNG" class="graf-image" /></figure>### Step 3 — Link the repository with Heroku

At this step, we can link the repository from Github to our Heroku application.

First, create a new application on Heroku and follow the steps listed on the platform.

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*J9tMV455odrM00UJ.PNG" class="graf-image" /></figure>Once the application has been created, a window similar to this should appear:

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*cowa0t6DgTqjUdjR.PNG" class="graf-image" /></figure>Now, if you look at the navigation at the top, you’ll see `Overview`, `Resources`, `Deploy`, `Metrics` and so on. Be sure that `Deploy` is selected. Then on the second row, click on the GitHub icon.

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*kAZI5kiisUiZ2Z9D.PNG" class="graf-image" /></figure>Search for the desired application, which is `demo-deploy-app-09` in our case. Then click `Connect`.

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*T89joca8hXRO8UsL.PNG" class="graf-image" /></figure>Once the application is successfully connected with your Heroku account, you can click `Deploy Branch` to deploy your application.

If you want, you can also select the option `Enable Automatic Deploys` which will automatically pull the code from your Github repository every time you make a push to that repository.

Once the application has been deployed, you can click on View to open your application.

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*9dBdxScA9_dIEz1Q.PNG" class="graf-image" /></figure>### Step 4 — Configure Heroku to properly run the application

If you open the application at this point, you should see something like this:

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*rMZ8aneIjG3nx211.PNG" class="graf-image" /></figure>That’s right, an error. That’s because Heroku doesn’t know how to start our application.

If you remember, we ran the command `node app.js` to start the application locally.  
Heroku has no way of knowing what commands it needs to run to start the application, and that’s why it threw an error.

To solve this problem, we must create a new file named `Procfile` with the following content: `web: node ./app.js`.

To update our application, all we need to do is push a new commit to GitHub. If we have enabled the `Automatic Deploys` option, then the code will be automatically pulled to Heroku. Otherwise we need to click on `Deploy Branch` again.

For example, a stack is an abstract data type that specifies a linear data structure with LIFO (last in, first out) behavior. Stacks are commonly implemented using arrays or linked lists, but a needlessly complicated implementation using a binary search tree is still a valid implementation. To be clear, it is incorrect to say that stacks are arrays or vice versa. An array can be used as a stack. Likewise, a stack can be implemented using an array.

Since abstract data types don’t specify an implementation, this means it’s also incorrect to talk about the time complexity of a given abstract data type. An associative array may or may not have O(1) average search times. An associative array that is implemented by a hash table does have O(1) average search times.

### Introduction to React for Complete Beginners

All of the code examples below will be included a second time at the bottom of this article as an embedded gist, so that it is properly syntax highlighted.

React uses a syntax extension of JavaScript called JSX that allows you to write HTML directly within JavaScript.

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/0*Olfj44MF6WSzvlSM.png" class="graf-image" /></figure>### React

> *React uses a syntax extension of JavaScript called JSX that allows you to write HTML directly within JavaScript*

> *because JSX is a syntactic extension of JavaScript, you can actually write JavaScript directly within JSX*

> *include the code you want to be treated as JavaScript within curly braces: { ‘this is treated as JavaScript code’ }*

> *JSX code must be compiled into JavaScript*

> *under the hood the challenges are calling ReactDOM.render (JSX, document.getElementById(‘root’))*

> *One important thing to know about nested JSX is that it must return a single element.*

> *For instance, several JSX elements written as siblings with no parent wrapper element will not transpile.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### From the React Docs:

### What is React?

React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”.

React has a few different kinds of components, but we’ll start with `React.Component` subclasses:

    class ShoppingList extends React.Component {
      render() {
        return (
          <div className="shopping-list">
            <h1>Shopping List for {this.props.name}</h1>
            <ul>
              <li>Instagram</li>
              <li>WhatsApp</li>
              <li>Oculus</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        );
      }
    }
    // Example usage: <ShoppingList name="Mark" />
    We’ll get to the funny XML-like tags soon. We use components to tell React what we want to see on the screen. When our data changes, React will efficiently update and re-render our components.
    Here, ShoppingList is a React component class, or React component type. A component takes in parameters, called props (short for “properties”), and returns a hierarchy of views to display via the render method.
    The render method returns a description of what you want to see on the screen. React takes the description and displays the result. In particular, render returns a React element, which is a lightweight description of what to render. Most React developers use a special syntax called “JSX” which makes these structures easier to write. The <div /> syntax is transformed at build time to React.createElement('div'). The example above is equivalent to:
    return React.createElement('div', {className: 'shopping-list'},
      React.createElement('h1', /* ... h1 children ... */),
      React.createElement('ul', /* ... ul children ... */)
    );

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Valid JSX:

    <div>
      <p>Paragraph One</p>
      <p>Paragraph Two</p>
      <p>Paragraph Three</p>
    </div>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Invalid JSX:

    <p>Paragraph One</p>
    <p>Paragraph Two</p>
    <p>Paragraph Three</p>

#### To put comments inside JSX, you use the syntax {/\* \*/} to wrap around the comment text.

To put comments inside JSX, you use the syntax {/\* \*/} to wrap around the comment text.

The code editor has a JSX element similar to what you created in the last challenge. Add a comment somewhere within the provided div element, without modifying the existing h1 or p elements.

    const JSX = (
      <div>
      {/* This is a comment */}
        <h1>This is a block of JSX</h1>
        <p>Here's a subtitle</p>
      </div>
    );

------------------------------------------------------------------------

> *With React, we can render this JSX directly to the HTML DOM using React’s rendering API known as ReactDOM.*

> *ReactDOM offers a simple method to render React elements to the DOM which looks like this:*

`ReactDOM.render(componentToRender, targetNode)`

-   <span id="f724">the first argument is the React element or component that you want to render,</span>
-   <span id="7093">and the second argument is the DOM node that you want to render the component to.</span>

> *ReactDOM.render() must be called after the JSX element declarations, just like how you must declare variables before using them.*

> *key difference in JSX is that you can no longer use the word class to define HTML classes.*

-   <span id="aafc">— -&gt; This is because class is a reserved word in JavaScript. Instead, JSX uses className</span>

> *the naming convention for all HTML attributes and event references in JSX become camelCase*

> *a click event in JSX is onClick, instead of onclick. Likewise, onchange becomes onChange. While this is a subtle difference, it is an important one to keep in mind moving forward.*

### Apply a class of myDiv to the div provided in the JSX code.

-   <span id="9500">The constant JSX should return a div element.</span>
-   <span id="8d42">The div should have a class of myDiv.</span>

<!-- -->

    const JSX = (
      <div>
        <h1>Add a class to this div</h1>
      </div>
    );

### Ans:

    const JSX = (
      <div className="myDiv">
        <h1>Add a class to this div</h1>
      </div>
    );

### React: Learn About Self-Closing JSX Tags

-Another important way in which JSX differs from HTML is in the idea of the self-closing tag.

> *In HTML, almost all tags have both an opening and closing tag:* `<div></div>;` *the closing tag always has a forward slash before the tag name that you are closing.*

> *there are special instances in HTML called “self-closing tags”, or tags that don’t require both an opening and closing tag before another tag can start.*

> *For example the line-break tag can be written as* `<br>` *or as* `<br           />,` *but should never be written as* `<br></br>`*, since it doesn’t contain any content.*

> *In JSX, the rules are a little different. Any JSX element can be written with a self-closing tag, and every element must be closed.  
> The line-break tag, for example, must always be written as* `<br />` *in order to be valid JSX that can be transpiled.  
> A* `<div>`*, on the other hand, can be written as* `<div           />`*or*`<div></div>`*.  
> The difference is that in the first syntax version there is no way to include anything in the* `<div />`*.*

### Fix the errors in the code editor so that it is valid JSX and successfully transpiles. Make sure you don’t change any of the content — you only need to close tags where they are needed.

    const JSX = (
      <div>
        <h2>Welcome to React!</h2> <br >
        <p>Be sure to close all tags!</p>
        <hr >
      </div>
    );

### Ans:

    const JSX = (
      <div>
        <h2>Welcome to React!</h2> <br />
        <p>Be sure to close all tags!</p>
        <hr />
      </div>
    );

### React: Create a Stateless Functional Component

> *There are two ways to create a React component. The first way is to use a JavaScript function.*

> *Defining a component in this way creates a stateless functional component.*

> *think of a stateless component as one that can receive data and render it, but does not manage or track changes to that data.*

#### To create a component with a function, you simply write a JavaScript function that returns either JSX or null

-   <span id="b514">React requires your function name to begin with a capital letter.</span>

> *Here’s an example of a stateless functional component that assigns an HTML class in JSX:*

    // After being transpiled, the <div> will have a CSS class of 'customClass'
    const DemoComponent = function() {
      return (
        <div className='customClass' />
      );
    };

> *Because a JSX component represents HTML, you could put several components together to create a more complex HTML page.*

### The code editor has a function called MyComponent. Complete this function so it returns a single div element which contains some string of text.

Note: The text is considered a child of the div element, so you will not be able to use a self-closing tag.

    const MyComponent = function() {
      // Change code below this line
    // Change code above this line

    }
    ANS:
    const MyComponent = function() {
      // Change code below this line
    return (
    <div> Some Text </div >
    );
    // Change code above this line

    };

    React: Create a React Component

    The other way to define a React component is with the ES6 class syntax. In the following example, Kitten extends React.Component:

    class Kitten extends React.Component {
      constructor(props) {
        super(props);
      }
    render() {

    return (

    <h1>Hi</h1>

    );

    }

    }

    This creates an ES6 class Kitten which extends the React.Component class.


    So the Kitten class now has access to many useful React features, such as local state and lifecycle hooks.


    Also notice the Kitten class has a constructor defined within it that calls super()


    It uses super() to call the constructor of the parent class, in this case React.Component


    The constructor is a special method used during the initialization of objects that are created with the class keyword. It is best practice to call a component’s constructor with super, and pass props to both.


    This makes sure the component is initialized properly. For now, know that it is standard for this code to be included.

    MyComponent is defined in the code editor using class syntax. Finish writing the render method so it returns a div element that contains an h1 with the text Hello React!.
    class MyComponent extends React.Component {
      constructor(props) {
        super(props);
      }
      render() {
        // Change code below this line
    // Change code above this line

    }

    };
    ANS:
    class MyComponent extends React.Component {
      constructor(props) {
        super(props);
      }
      render() {
        // Change code below this line
     return (
       <div>
          <h1>Hello React!</h1>
          </div>
        );
    // Change code above this line

    }

    };

    React: Create a Component with Composition

    Imagine you are building an App and have created three components, a Navbar, Dashboard, and Footer.


    To compose these components together, you could create an App parent component which renders each of these three components as children. To render a component as a child in a React component, you include the component name written as a custom HTML tag in the JSX.


    For example, in the render method you could write:

    return (
     <App>
      <Navbar />
      <Dashboard />
      <Footer />
     </App>
    )

> *When React encounters a custom HTML tag that references another component (a component name wrapped in &lt; /&gt; like in this example), it renders the markup for that component in the location of the tag. This should illustrate the parent/child relationship between the App component and the Navbar, Dashboard, and Footer.*

### Challenge:

> *In the code editor, there is a simple functional component called ChildComponent and a class component called ParentComponent. Compose the two together by rendering the ChildComponent within the ParentComponent. Make sure to close the ChildComponent tag with a forward slash.*

-   <span id="2ed5">Note:**ChildComponent is defined with an ES6 arrow function because this is a very common practice when using React**.</span>
-   <span id="fddd">However, know that this is just a function.</span>

<!-- -->

    const ChildComponent = () => {
      return (
        <div>
          <p>I am the child</p>
        </div>
      );
    };

    class ParentComponent extends React.Component {
      constructor(props) {
        super(props);
      }
      render() {
        return (
          <div>
            <h1>I am the parent</h1>
            { /* Change code below this line */ }

            { /* Change code above this line */ }
          </div>
        );
      }
    };

⌛The React component should return a single div element.  
⌛The component should return two nested elements.  
⌛The component should return the ChildComponent as its second child.

### Ans:

    const ChildComponent = () => {
      return (
        <div>
          <p>I am the child</p>
        </div>
      );
    };
    class ParentComponent extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    }
    render() {
    return (
    <div>
    <h1>I am the parent</h1>
    { /* Change code below this line */ }
        { /* Change code above this line */ }
      &lt;/div&gt;
    );

    }

    };

    JavaScript Rotate (Array) ProblemWalkthrough
    Explanation for Rotate Right

    CODEX
    JavaScript Rotate (Array) Problem Walkthrough
    Explanation for Rotate Right



    Question
    Write a function rotateRight(array, num) that takes in an array and a number as arguments.

    The function should return a new array where the elements of the array are rotated to the right number times.

    The function should not mutate the original array and instead return a new array.


    Define this function using function expression syntax.

    HINT: you can use Array#slice to create a copy of an array


    JavaScript gives us four methods to add or remove items from the beginning or end of arrays:

    pop(): Remove an item from the end of an array
    let cats = ['Bob', 'Willy', 'Mini'];
    cats.pop(); // ['Bob', 'Willy']

    pop() returns the removed item.

    push(): Add items to the end of an array
    let cats = ['Bob'];
    cats.push('Willy'); // ['Bob', 'Willy']
    cats.push('Puff', 'George'); // ['Bob', 'Willy', 'Puff', 'George']

    push() returns the new array length.

    shift(): Remove an item from the beginning of an array
    let cats = ['Bob', 'Willy', 'Mini'];
    cats.shift(); // ['Willy', 'Mini']

    shift() returns the removed item.

    unshift(): Add items to the beginning of an array
    let cats = ['Bob'];
    cats.unshift('Willy'); // ['Willy', 'Bob']
    cats.unshift('Puff', 'George'); // ['Puff', 'George', 'Willy', 'Bob']

    unshift() returns the new array length.

    We are being asked for two things:

    To return an array with all the elements shifted over ‘num’ times.
    To NOT mutate the original array

    Step 1.

    We need to start the function and create a variable to hold a COPY of our input array.
    Array.prototype.slice()
     The slice() method returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array into a new array object selected from start to end…developer.mozilla.org

    We assign array.slice(0) to a variable called result.
    Slicing our input array simply creates a sliced copy of the data.
    Remember that by excluding a second argument in our slice parameter allows us to slice from the first argument all the way to the end.

    Step 2.

    We need to create a for loop to tell our function how many times we want to rotate.

    By setting our second delimiter to i < num we will ask our loops to run num times.
    Running num times is the same as executing the code block within num times.

    Step 3.

    We need to put some executable code within our for loop to be run during every cycle.

    Since we are rotating to the right, every change to our result array under the hood will look like this (if we ref. our first test case):
    ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd',                     'e']; (how it looks like at the start)
    ['e', 'a', 'b', 'c',                     'd']; (after one run of the for loop)
    ['d', 'e', 'a', 'b',                     'c']; (after second/last run of the for loop)
    To accomplish this we first need to ‘pop’ off or remove our last element.
    Two things happen when we use this built-in function.
    Our copied array is mutated to lose it’s last ele.
    The removed element is stored in the variable we assigned to the function.
    Our second step is to add it to the start of our array, to do this we can use unshift.
    By inputting the variable we are using to hold our removed element into the parameter of unshift we are adding our element to the front of the array.

    Step 4.
    Now that our for loop has ended and our copied array looks just like how the answer looks, we need to output the answer.

    We accomplish this by creating a return line AFTER the for loop.

    End Result

    Job Boards and The Hunt
    I can’t imagine the kind of masochism it would take to enjoy the act of posting and daily maintenance on a job board…It’s part of the process that you’ve already invested so much of yourself in, so you should take pride in it; do a good job the first time around and you’ll get where your going in the blink of an eye!
    A list of all of my articles to link to future posts
     You should probably skip this one… seriously it’s just for internal use!bryanguner.medium.com

    Update(After The Interview):
    As a candidate, there are key next steps that you can and should after every interview to help you stand out.
    Send a thank you email within 24 business hours
    Do not miss this step! It takes less than five minutes and can make the difference between you and another candidate. It also keeps you fresh in your interviewers’ memories. For example:
    ‍
    Hi (name),

    Thank you so much for taking the time to meet with me yesterday to discuss my candidacy for (role title). After learning more about (share one or two takeaways from the interview about the company/team’s priorities), I’m even more excited to bring my skills in (1–3 relevant skills) to the team.


    I look forward to hearing from you about next steps, and if there is anything that I can clarify about my experience or qualifications for the (role title) position, please don’t hesitate to reach out.


    Thank you for your consideration,


    (your name)

    Follow up
    Don’t wait for the company to reach out to you! Be proactive in showing your interest by checking in to see where you stand in the process. If a company indicates a deadline by which you will hear back, and the deadline has passed, follow-up!
    Check your email and phone regularly

    ‍*

    *Don’t ghost on a company at any stage in the process; make sure you add their domain to your safe senders list and respond to any messages within 24 hours.
    ‍
    Be prepared

    ‍*

    *You might be invited for another interview on short notice; review the description regularly so it doesn’t slip from your memory, and keep brushing up on skills you may need for an interview (chances are, this won’t be the only job you’ll need them for anyway!)





    Here I will maintain a running list of applicable job boards and below I will go into detail about the niches they occupy and whatever I resource I have found to use them to your maximum advantage. !

    I am intentionally not linking glassdoor because they have irritated me for the last time by insisting I provide a job review every time I want to access their content… (To the makers of glassdoor… HOW MANY TIMES A MONTH DO YOU THINK I CHANGE JOBS!!!!) I don’t have 15 minutes to make up a job experience every time I want to read a review.


    Also here is a repo of compiled job search and interviewing resources:

    bgoonz/INTERVIEW-PREP-COMPLETE
     Your resume is your personal summary sheet. Your resume is the thing that gets your foot in the door. So, there’s a few…github.com






    First off I am going to introduce a few different categories for those of you who are completely overwhelmed by the prospect of even selecting a job board let alone establishing a competitive presence on one. Here’s a few catorizations I think are worth distinguishing for one and other.
    1. Interpersonal Connections
    Seek to leverage the connections you have with people you know and companies you want to work with. I know that that’s a violation of the premise of this article but without even feeling the need to provide quantitative proof; I can confidently assume that this is the most ROI efficient way to produce a desirable result. (Sorry introverts… 2020 may have been your year but this is our world. 😘)
    If personal connections don’t come through, the next best thing is cold outreach (best in terms of results…. personally I hate cold calling strangers and I am an extrovert.)

    Before or after submitting an application, identify 1–3 professionals to reach out to at the company to express interest in opportunities.
    Send a message to express interest and request an informational interview with the individual via LinkedIn, email, Twitter, or other available communication methods.
    If you hear back and the individual is willing to connect, confirm a day and time to conduct a preliminary interview. OR If you have yet to hear back after 3 business days, follow-up.

    Once you send off a message in step two, there are a variety of responses you may receive. Sometimes an individual will forward you along to someone who may be of better assistance, other times your message may be overlooked with no reply, and its possible (best case scenario) your request for a chat becomes an invitation to interview.









    2. LinkedIn.
    I am going to devote a lot of time to this one because it is the largest and most active of all the job board ecosystems… period… full stop regardless of your industry.
    LinkedIn now has almost 740 million members with over 55 million registered companies. (for comparison 12.3 million people visited Indeed in October, up 19.6 percent. Monster.com attracted 12.1 million people, and CareerBuilder.comattractedd 11.3 million in that same time) and LinkedIn is the most-used social media platform amongst Fortune 500 companies as it provides far more networking capabilities than pure recruitment.
    If you put your resume and skills on LinkedIn.com as a software Engineer, and state that you are open to new opportunities, you will be contacted by multiple recruiters, and if your skills are desirable possibly also directly by companies seeking to hire you. It’s a developer’s market; there’s not enough people out there, especially in America.
    Here’s my profile… feel free to connect… the larger your network the greater your exposure is to someone who works at your potential dream job.

    Here’s A Linkedin Checklist I will be using before I return to the job hunt!
    LinkedIn
     Personal and Contact Information:www.notion.so

    excerpt:

    Experience Section

    [ ] I have listed all professional roles included on my resume in this section and any that I had to cut from my resume for space
    [ ] I have written 2–4 power statements for each experience listed (okay to copy and paste from resume)
    [ ] My power statements for each experience are bulleted, not in paragraph form.
    [ ] I did list responsibilities in bullet point format (I did not leave in paragraph format)
    [ ] I did start each bullet point with an action verb and I did not use phrases such as: Assisted with... Worked on... Helped with... (Solely responsible for... ok)
    [ ] I did describe past projects in past tense and current projects in present tense
    [ ] I did not use pronouns such as: “I,” “we,” “they, “you,” “me,” “us”
    [ ] Optional: Bootcamp student experience and projects can be listed under your experience section if you have no (or almost no) prior work experience.
    [ ] If I listed my Bootcamp student experience, my title is [name of program] Student (example: Data Science Student)
    [ ] I copied and pasted my Lambda projects in my student description and also included them in the Accomplishments section

    Do’s:
    Spend a good portion of your time learning and reading. Your jobs teach you so much about an organization and the business.
    Follow business owners and senior managers, successful team leaders in large organizations, startup owners. You would be surprised how willing some otherwise busy executives are to rub elbows with veritable newcomers. They’re not just doing this out of the kindness of their hearts, just like you… they have an ulterior motive. They are hoping to build goodwill with the incoming workforce in a bid to make their company more attractive to high quality candidates. If they give you any of their time…treat it like an interview.

    To leverage this information, (the trick is to constantly remind yourself to be on your game with speaking with them.) I do not care what your teacher’s past have said… mark my words… THERE IS MOST CERTAINLY SUCH A THING AS A STUPID QUESTION…Anyone who tells you otherwise is either stupid themselves or just overcome with their own compassion (an admirable trait but ultimately a disservice to you the competitive job seeker).

    How to Ask Great Questions
     In Brief The Problem Some professionals such as litigators, journalists and even doctors, are taught to ask questions…hbr.org

    Engage in networking. I would recommend finding and connecting with current attendee of any software development bootcamp. They’re all (for the most part) programatically encouraged to connect network and engage in peer skill promotion (even if they have no idea of you skill level). If that weren’t enough reason, all of them come from a cohort of other individuals being instructed to do the same. Once you have a few in your network other’s will seek you out through Linkedin recommendations algorithm.


    Note to prospective employers please just skip the next few sentences and don’t ask why…😅


    Of the 214 people that vouched for me… I guestimate about only 80 actually know me in any respectable capacity, and of those, only probably 30 or so are familiar with my competency in the skills they endorsed. It all boils down to the strategies that bootcamps instill in their students. It’s the polar opposite of a zero sum game and they’re more than happy to exchange personal recommendations with you. They’re also far more driven to consistently engage with other members of the linkedin ecosystem because they need to a network to help compensate for their lack of a four year degree and the connections you make in that time.








    Build your personal brand. Developing your brand will not only help you attract clients or recruits if you decide to start a business, but will also help you find great job opportunities. You can post anything you take pride in so long as it’s fairly professional. Definitely make use of the featured section to showcase your work.




    Don’t:
    Don’t Use LinkedIn’s Default Headline
    LinkedIn automatically populates your headline with your current job title and company name. I hope it goes without saying… but as a rule avoid signaling to prospective employers the depths of your laziness by using any stock responses LinkedIn provides you.
    Don’t Go Ham On Keyword Placment
    Placing keywords strategically into your LinkedIn profile is virtually the only way to ensure being flagged by search algorithms as a potential candidate.You could be forgiven for being tempted to heed the advice of your inner lizard brain, and just stuffing your profile with buzzwords but this will likely trigger a spam account checker and result in worse outcomes than the absence of said keywords.







    Why it matters¿
    Are We Really All Connected by Just Six Degrees of Separation?
    Most of us are familiar with the concept of six degrees of separation — the idea is that anyone in the planet can be connected to anyone else in just six steps. So through just five other people, you’re effectively connected to the Queen of England, Jim Belushi or even yo mamma.

    Back to the other Job Board Niches:
    3. Traditional job boards. Dice.com, Monster.com, etc. They will not find you great jobs at technology companies; they may find you openings as a software engineer at other types of more traditional companies (for example, banks, retail chains, etc though.
    4. Local-focused sites. The biggest is Craigslist, but there are others. Often great for contract work and opportunities you wouldn’t have otherwise come across.
    5. Freelancer websites. oDesk.com, Elance.com, etc. Lower pay, but 100% contract work, and has a lot of flexible opportunities if you’re not looking for traditional full-time employment or remote work.

    CSS Selectors

    Learn CSS So That Your Site Doesn’t Look Like Garbage
    CSS Selectors

    CSS Selector : Applies styles to a specific DOM element(s), there are various types:
    Type Selectors : Matches by node name.
    Class Selectors : Matches by class name.
    ID Selectors : Matches by ID name.
    Universal Selectors : Selects all HTML elements on a page.
    Attribute Selectors : Matches elements based on the prescence or value of a given attribute. (i.e. a[title] will match all a elements with a title attribute)

    /* Type selector */
    div {
      background-color: #000000;
    }/* Class selector */
    .active {
      color: #ffffff;
    }/* ID selector */
    #list-1 {
      border: 1px solid gray;
    }/* Universal selector */
    * {
      padding: 10px;
    }/* Attribute selector */
    a[title] {
      font-size: 2em;
    }

**Class Selectors**

-   <span id="fddf">Used to select all elements of a certain class denoted with a `.[class             name]`</span>
-   <span id="72af">You can assign multiple classes to a DOM element by separating them with a space.</span>

**Compound Class Selectors**

-   <span id="befd">To get around accidentally selecting elements with multiple classes beyond what we want to grab we can chain dots.</span>
-   <span id="e2c8">TO use a compound class selector just append the classes together when referencing them in the CSS.</span>

    <div class="box orange"></div>
    <div class="circle orange"></div>

-   <span id="7dd3">i.e. .box.yellow will select only the first element.</span>
-   <span id="8904">KEEP IN MIND that if you do include a space it will make the selector into a *descendant selector*.</span>

<!-- -->

    h1#heading,
    h2.subheading {
      font-style: italic;
    }

-   <span id="a8bc">When we want to target all `h1` tags with the id of `heading`.</span>

**CSS Combinators**

-   <span id="c196">CSS Combinators are used to combine other selectors into more complex or targeted selectors — they are very powerful!</span>
-   <span id="71a6">Be careful not to use too many of them as they will make your CSS far too complex.</span>
-   <span id="6032">`Descendant Selectors`</span>
-   <span id="6f41">Separated by a space.</span>
-   <span id="3829">Selects all descendants of a parent container.</span>
-   <span id="e90c">`Direct Child Selectors`</span>
-   <span id="52b5">Indicated with a `>`.</span>
-   <span id="ea8e">Different from descendants because it only affects the direct children of an element.</span>
-   <span id="486f">`.menu > .is-active { background-color: #ffe0b2; }`</span>
-   <span id="96f9">`<body> <div class="menu"> <div             class="is-active">Belka</div> <div> <div             class="is-active">Strelka</div> </div> </div> </body> <div             class="is-active"> Laika </div> </body>`</span>
-   <span id="59ca">Belka would be the only element selected.</span>
-   <span id="0266">`Adjacent Sibling Selectors`</span>
-   <span id="a648">Uses the `+` symbol.</span>
-   <span id="9d79">Used for elements that directly follow one another and who both have the same parent.</span>
-   <span id="4865">`h1 + h2 { font-style: italic; } <h1>Big header</h1> <h2>This one is             styled because it is directly adjacent to the H1</h2> <h2>This one is NOT styled because there             is no H1 right before it</h2>`</span>

**Pseudo-Classes**

-   <span id="b638">`Pseudo-Class` : Specifies a special state of the seleted element(s) and does not refer to any elements or attributes contained in the DOM.</span>
-   <span id="0360">Format is a `Selector:Pseudo-Class Name` or `A:B`</span>
-   <span id="91ee">`a:hover { font-family: "Roboto Condensed", sans-serif; color: #4fc3f7;             text-decoration: none; border-bottom: 2px solid #4fc3f7; }`</span>
-   <span id="27ac">Some common pseudo-classes that are frequently used are:</span>
-   <span id="9b2b">`active` : ‘push down’, when ele are activated.</span>
-   <span id="5b2f">`checked` : applies to things like radio buttons or checkbox inputs.</span>
-   <span id="58da">`disabled` : any disabled element.</span>

-   <span id="43ed">`valid` : form elements in a valid state.</span>
-   <span id="6460">`visited` : anchor tags of whih the user has already been to the URL that the href points to.</span>

`Pseudo-Selectors`

-   <span id="89e7">Used to create pseudo-elements as children of the elements to which the property applies.</span>
-   <span id="0bef">`::after`</span>
-   <span id="52f9">`::before`</span>

<!-- -->

    <style>
      p::before {
        background-color: lightblue;
        border-right: 4px solid violet;
        content: ":-) ";
        margin-right: 4px;
        padding-left: 4px;
      }
    </style>
    <p>This is the first paragraph</p>
    <p>This is the second paragraph</p>
    <p>This is the third paragraph</p>

-   <span id="a843">Will add some blue smiley faces before the p tag elements.</span>

**CSS Rules**

-   <span id="919a">`CSS Rule` : Collection of single or compound selectors, a curly brace, zero or more properties</span>
-   <span id="555f">`CSS Rule Specificity` : Sometimes CSS rules will contain multiple elements and may have overlapping properties rules for those same elements - there is an algorithm in CSS that calculates which rule takes precedence.</span>
-   <span id="a1db">`The Four Number Calculation` : listed in increasing order of importance.</span>

Who has the most IDs? If no one, continue.

Who has the most classes? If no one, continue.

Who has the most tags? If no one, continue.

Last Read in the browser wins.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### CSS: Type, Properties, and Imports

**Typography**

-   <span id="d6fc">`font-family` : change the font.</span>

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*ssVcT1Bd9Edfo6KF" class="graf-image" /></figure><figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*WmqUyKiumM8RCJQo.png" class="graf-image" /></figure>-   <span id="daba">Remember that not all computers have the same fonts on them.</span>
-   <span id="0aa8">You can import web fonts via an api by using</span>
-   <span id="0c5d">`@import             url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Liu+Jian+Mao+Cao&display=swap');` and pasting it st the top of your CSS file.</span>
-   <span id="d8ff">And then reference it in your font-family.</span>
-   <span id="ee9f">`font-size` : Changes the size of your font.</span>
-   <span id="782e">Keep in mind the two kind of units CSS uses:</span>
-   <span id="c4f7">`Absolute` : `Pixels`, Points, Inches, Centimeters.</span>
-   <span id="2884">`Relative` : Em, Rem.</span>
-   <span id="f9b5">Em: Calulating the size relative to the previous div (bubbles down)</span>
-   <span id="5a5d">Rem: Calulates relative to the parent element always.</span>
-   <span id="79b0">`font-style` : Used to set a font to italics.</span>
-   <span id="f464">`font-weight` : Used to make a font bold.</span>
-   <span id="3d56">`text-align` : Used to align your text to the left, center, or right.</span>
-   <span id="4cbc">`text-decoration` : Use to put lines above, through, or under text. Lines can be solid, dashed, or wavy!</span>
-   <span id="1c96">`text-transform` : Used to set text to all lowercase, uppercase, or capitalize all words.</span>

**Background-Images**

-   <span id="13eb">You can use the background-image property to set a background image for an element.</span>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### CSS: Colors, Borders, and Shadows

**Colors**

-   <span id="6bed">You can set colors in CSS in three popular ways: by name, by hexadecimal RGB value, and by their decimal RGB value.</span>
-   <span id="38fb">rgba() is used to make an rbg value more transparent, the `a` is used to specify the `alpha channel`.</span>
-   <span id="cb05">**Color** : Property used to change the color of text.</span>
-   <span id="6f05">**Background-Color** : Property to change the backgrounf color of an element.</span>

**Borders**

-   <span id="d922">Borders take three values: The width of the border, the style (i.e. solid, dotted, dashed), color of the border.</span>

**Shadows**

-   <span id="bccb">There are two kinds of shadows in CSS: `box shadows` and `text             shadows`.</span>
-   <span id="7fd2">Box refers to HTML elements.</span>
-   <span id="f3a7">Text refers to text.</span>
-   <span id="2a53">Shadows take values such as, the horizontal & vertical offsets of the shadow, the blur radius of the shadow, the spread radius, and of course the colors.</span>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### The Box Model

**Box Model** : A concept that basically boils down that every DOM element has a box around it.

Imagine a gift, inside is the gift, wrapped in foam all around (padding), and the giftbox outside of it (border) and then a wrapping paper on the giftbox (margin).- For items that are using `block` as it’s display, the browser will follow these rules to layout the element: - The box fills 100% of the available container space. - Every new box takes on a new line/row. - Width and Height properties are respected. - Padding, Margin, and Border will push other elements away from the box. - Certain elements have `block` as their default display, such as: divs, headers, and paragraphs.- For items that are using `inline` as it’s display, the browser will follow these rules to layout the element: - Each box appears in a single line until it fills up the space. - Width and height are **not** respected. - Padding, Margin, and Border are applied but they **do not** push other elements away from the box. - Certain elements have `inline` as their default display, such as: span tags, anchors, and images.

**Standard Box Model vs Border-Box**- As per the standard Box Model, the width and height pertains to the content of the box and excludes any additional padding, borders, and margins.

This bothered many programmers so they created the **border box** to include the calculation of the entire box’s height and width.

**Inline-Block**- Inline-block uses the best features of both `block` and `inline`. - Elements still get laid out left to right. - Layout takes into account specified width and height.

**Padding**- Padding applies padding to every side of a box. It is shorthand for four padding properties in this order: `padding-top`, `padding-right`, `padding-bottom`, `padding-left` (clockwise!)

**Border**- Border applies a border on all sides of an element. It takes three values in this order: `border-width`, `border-style`, `border-color`. - All three properties can be broken down in the four sides clockwise: top, right, bottom, left.

**Margin**- Margin sets margins on every side of an element. It takes four values in this order: `margin-top`, `margin-right`, `margin-bottom`, `margin-left`. - You can use `margin: 0 auto` to center an element.

### Positioning

-   <span id="d380">The `position` property allows us to set the position of elements on a page and is an integral part of creatnig a Web page layout.</span>
-   <span id="1bd6">It accepts five values: `static`, `relative`, `absolute`, `fixed`, `sticky`.</span>
-   <span id="0b53">Every property (minus `static`) is used with: `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left` to position an element on a page.</span>

**Static Positioning**

-   <span id="7aa9">The default position value of page elements.</span>
-   <span id="700a">Most likely will not use static that much.</span>

**Relative Positioning**

-   <span id="adc3">Remains in it’s original position in the page flow.</span>
-   <span id="9533">It is positioned *RELATIVE* to the it’s *ORIGINAL PLACE* on the page flow.</span>
-   <span id="8c0b">Creates a **stacking context** : overlapping elements whose order can be set by the z-index property.</span>

<!-- -->

    #pink-box {
      background-color: #ff69b4;
      bottom: 0;
      left: -20px;
      position: relative;
      right: 0;
      top: 0;
    }

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*mMCUEQ94L4_zxwNc" class="graf-image" /></figure><figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*TgjpfTmdczESRAfU.png" class="graf-image" /></figure>**Absolute Positioning**

-   <span id="d597">Absolute elements are removed from the normal page flow and other elements around it act like it’s not there. (how we can easily achieve some layering)</span>
-   <span id="eb5b">Here are some examples to illustration absolute positioning:</span>

<!-- -->

    .container {
      background-color: #2b2d2f;
      position: relative;
    }#pink-box {
      position: absolute;
      top: 60px;
    }

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*Mu1E5D10RQaBpzms" class="graf-image" /></figure><figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*6jvV-NnX5HS5PuVT.png" class="graf-image" /></figure>-   <span id="adb4">Note that the container ele has a relative positioning — this is so that any changes made to the absolute positioned children will be positioned from it’s top-left corner.</span>
-   <span id="be4f">Note that because we removed the pink from the normal page flow, the container has now shifted the blue box to where the pink box should have been — which is why it is now layered beneath the pink.</span>

<!-- -->

    .container {
      background-color: #2b2d2f;
      position: relative;
    }#pink-box {
      position: absolute;
      top: 60px;
    }#blue-box {
      position: absolute;
    }

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*phWx-191VVQ5pRF9" class="graf-image" /></figure><figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*o_T8meZgQSu7kxfs.png" class="graf-image" /></figure>-   <span id="9e42">As you can see here, since we have also taken the blue box out of the normal page flow by declaring it as absoutely positioned it now overlaps over the pink box.</span>

<!-- -->

    .container {
      background-color: #2b2d2f;
      position: relative;
    }#pink-box {
      background-color: #ff69b4;
      bottom: 60px;
      position: absolute;
    }

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*HJbtARqC1qmeWTHS" class="graf-image" /></figure><figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*rRNttTlXfnhqERYU.png" class="graf-image" /></figure>-   <span id="528a">Example where the absolute element has it’s bottom property modified.</span>

<!-- -->

    .container {
      background-color: #2b2d2f;
    }#pink-box {
      background-color: #ff69b4;
      bottom: 60px;
      position: absolute;
    }

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*e7H6ImFUmcPGMaoa" class="graf-image" /></figure><figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*Al6ILt84EC0bhjnK.png" class="graf-image" /></figure>-   <span id="f676">If we removed the container’s relative position. Our absolute unit would look for the nearest parent which would be the document itself.</span>

**Fixed Positioning**

-   <span id="fe31">Another positioning that removes it’s element from the page flow, and automatically positions it’s parent as the HTML doc itself.</span>
-   <span id="2388">Fixed also uses top, right, bottom, and left.</span>
-   <span id="3903">Useful for things like nav bars or other features we want to keep visible as the user scrolls.</span>

**Sticky Positioning**

-   <span id="8ae2">Remains in it’s original position in the page flow, and it is positioned relative to it’s closest block-level ancestor and any *scrolling* ancestors.</span>
-   <span id="abe8">Behaves like a relatively positioned element until the point at which you would normally scroll past it’s viewport — then it sticks!</span>
-   <span id="7ac0">It is positioned with top, right, bottom, and left.</span>
-   <span id="9080">A good example are headers in a scrollable list.</span>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Flexible Box Model

-   <span id="46aa">Flexbox is a **CSS module** that provides a convenient way for us to display items inside a flexible container so that the layout is responsive.</span>
-   <span id="ebb3">Float was used back in the day to display position of elements in a container.</span>
-   <span id="2a8e">A very inconvenient aspect of float is the need to *clear* the float.</span>
-   <span id="ba98">To ‘clear’ a float we need to set up a ghost div to properly align — this is already sounds so inefficient.</span>

**Using Flexbox**

-   <span id="e23b">Flexbox automatically resizes a container element to fit the viewport size without needing to use breakpoints.</span>

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*_SXOQpq3yrywWCcL" class="graf-image" /></figure><figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*IBJIWQ7Z_23eERWn.png" class="graf-image" /></figure>-   <span id="b505">Flexbox layout applies styles to the parent element, and it’s children.</span>

<!-- -->

    .container {
      display: flex; /*sets display to use flex*/
      flex-wrap: wrap; /*bc flex tries to fit everything into one line, use wrap to have the elements wrap to the next line*/
      flex-direction: row; /*lets us create either rows or columns*/
    }

-   <span id="4898">`flex-flow` can be used to combine wrap and direction.</span>
-   <span id="acdb">`justify-content` used to define the alignment of flex items along the main axis.</span>
-   <span id="68d6">`align-items` used to define the alignment on the Y-axis.</span>
-   <span id="f0d8">`align-content` redistributes extra space on the cross axis.</span>
-   <span id="531c">By default, flex items will appear in the order they are added to the DOM, but we can use the `order` property to change that.</span>
-   <span id="39b0">Some other properties we can use on flex items are:</span>
-   <span id="ec38">`flex-grow` : dictates amount of avail. space the item should take up.</span>
-   <span id="0916">`flex-shrink` : defines the ability for a flex item to shrink.</span>
-   <span id="4dda">`flex-basis` : Default size of an element before the remaining space is distributed.</span>
-   <span id="d9f2">`flex` : shorthand for grow, shrink and basis.</span>
-   <span id="f127">`align-self` : Overrides default alignment in the container.</span>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Grid Layout

-   <span id="cc4f">CSS Grid is a 2d layout system that let’s use create a grid with columns and rows purely using Vanilla CSS. (flex is one dimensional)</span>

**Bootstrap vs CSS Grid**

-   <span id="4af2">Bootstrap was a front-end library commonly used to create grid layouts but now CSS grid provides greater flexibility and control.</span>
-   <span id="e404">Grid applies style to a parent container and it’s child elements.</span>

<!-- -->

    .grid-container {
      display: grid;
      grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
      grid-template-rows: auto;
      grid-template-areas:
        "header header header"
        "main . sidebar"
        "footer footer footer";  grid-column-gap: 20px;
      grid-row-gap: 30px;
      justify-items: stretch;
      align-items: stretch;
      justify-content: stretch;
      align-content: stretch;
    }.item-1 {
      grid-area: header;
    }
    .item-2 {
      grid-area: main;
    }
    .item-3 {
      grid-area: sidebar;
    }
    .item-4 {
      grid-area: footer;
    }

-   <span id="26c3">Columns and Rows can be defined with: pixels, percentages, auto, named grid lines, using `repeat`, fractions.</span>
-   <span id="a117">`Grid Template Areas` gives us a handy way to map out and visualize areas of the grid layout.</span>
-   <span id="17ae">Combine areas with templates to define how much space an area should take up.</span>
-   <span id="f90a">`Grid Gaps` can be used to create ‘gutters’ between grid item.s</span>
-   <span id="d7c0">The way we have defined our grid with `grid-templates` and `areas` are considered **explicit**.</span>
-   <span id="cef6">We can also `implicitly` define grids.</span>

<!-- -->

    .grid-container {
      display: grid;
      grid-template-columns: 100px 100px 100px 100px;
      grid-template-rows: 50px 50px 50px;
      grid-auto-columns: 100px;
      grid-auto-rows: 50px;
    }

-   <span id="e6d3">Any grid items that aren’t explicity placed are automatically placed or *re-flowed*</span>

**Spanning Columns & Rows**

-   <span id="98c8">We can use the following properties to take up a specified num of cols and rows.</span>
-   <span id="0208">`grid-column-start`</span>
-   <span id="437a">`grid-column-end`</span>
-   <span id="7d03">`grid-row-start`</span>
-   <span id="0a8e">`grid-row-end`</span>
-   <span id="c62b">All four properties can take any of the following values: the line number, span \#, span name, auto.</span>

<!-- -->

    .item-1 {
      grid-row-start: row2-start; /* Item starts at row line named "row2-start" */
      grid-row-end: 5; /* Item ends at row line 5 */
      grid-column-start: 1; /* Item starts at column line 1 */
      grid-column-end: three; /* Item ends at column line named "three" */
    }.item-2 {
      grid-row-start: 1; /* Item starts at row line 1 */
      grid-row-end: span 2; /* Item spans two rows and ends at row line 3 */
      grid-column-start: 3; /* Item starts at column line 3 */
      grid-column-end: span col5-start; /* Item spans and ends at line named "col5-start" */
    }

**Grid Areas**

-   <span id="9dd0">We use the grid areas in conjunction with grid-container property to **define sections of the layout**.</span>
-   <span id="5ec2">We can then assign named sections to individual element’s css rules.</span>

**Justify & Align Self**

-   <span id="06b0">Justify items and Align Items can be used to align all grid items at once.</span>
-   <span id="53f5">**Justify Self** is used to align self on the row.</span>
-   <span id="f6b1">It can take four values: start, end, center, stretch.</span>
-   <span id="72bb">**Align Self** is used to align self on the column.</span>
-   <span id="d5d4">It can take four values: start, end, center, stretch.</span>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**CSS Hover Effect and Handling**

**Overflow**

`css .btn { background-color: #00bfff; color: #ffffff; border-radius: 10px; padding: 1.5rem; }`

`.btn--active:hover { cursor: pointer; transform: translateY(-0.25rem);`

`/* Moves our button up/down on the Y axis */ }`

The Pseudo Class Selector `hover` activates when the cursor goes over the selected element.

**Content Overflow**- You can apply an `overflow` content property to an element if it’s inner contents are spilling over.

There are three members in the overflow family: — `overflow-x` : Apply horizontally. - `overflow-y` : Apply vertically. - `overflow` : Apply both directions.

### Transitions

-   <span id="b5a7">Transitions provide a way to control animation speed when changing CSS properties.</span>
-   <span id="2e1b">**Implicit Transitions** : Animations that involve transitioning between two states.</span>

**Defining Transitions**

-   <span id="bbd6">`transition-property` : specifies the name of the CSS property to apply the transition.</span>
-   <span id="6340">`transition-duration` : during of the transition.</span>
-   <span id="7463">`transition-delay` : time before the transition should start.</span>

### BEM Guidelines

-   <span id="6474">BEM was created as a guideline to solve the issue of loose standards around CSS naming conventions.</span>
-   <span id="6d0c">**BEM** stands for `block`, `element`, `modifier`.</span>
-   <span id="3eb9">**Block**</span>
-   <span id="f6b4">A standalone entity that is meaningful on it’s own.</span>
-   <span id="7e86">Can be nested and interact with one another.</span>
-   <span id="338e">Holistic entities without DOM rep can be blocks.</span>
-   <span id="f2f0">May consist latin letters, digits, and dashes.</span>
-   <span id="3bfb">Any DOM node can be a block if it accepts a class name.</span>
-   <span id="5c9b">**Element**</span>
-   <span id="1b95">Part of a block and has no standalone meaning.</span>
-   <span id="b5cf">Any element that is semantically tied to a block.</span>
-   <span id="10e2">May consist latin letters, digits, and dashes.</span>
-   <span id="9b79">Formed by using two underscores after it’s block name.</span>
-   <span id="e282">Any DOM node within a block can be an element.</span>
-   <span id="a0dc">Element classes should be used independently.</span>
-   <span id="26f1">**Modifier**</span>
-   <span id="6642">A flag on blocks or elements. Use them to change appearance, behavior or state.</span>
-   <span id="6cca">Extra class name to add onto blocks or elements.</span>
-   <span id="745f">Add mods only to the elements they modify.</span>
-   <span id="6416">Modifier names may consist of Latin letters, digits, dashes and underscores.</span>
-   <span id="f940">Written with two dashes.</span>

**BEM Example**

    <form class="form form--theme-xmas form--simple">
      <input class="form__input" type="text" />
      <input class="form__submit form__submit--disabled" type="submit" />
    </form>/* block selector */
    .form {
    }/* block modifier selector */
    .form--theme-xmas {
    }/* block modifier selector */
    .form--simple {
    }/* element selector */
    .form__input {
    }/* element selector */
    .form__submit {
    }/* element modifier selector */
    .form__submit--disabled {

### Life Saving Bash Scripts Part 2

#### I am not saying they’re in any way special compared with other bash scripts… but when I consider that you can never recover time spent… the value of these commands in my life quickly becomes incalculable!

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*aWKygEnTVdHuulB4.gif" class="graf-image" /></figure>Below the following 20 commands I will include <a href="https://gist.github.com/bgoonz/2d2314216d337a69b31bcb5a8880ade7" class="markup--anchor markup--pullquote-anchor">the gist files</a> so you can download these commands all at once as well as see them syntax highlighted but I decided to include them as plain code blocks for the ease with which they can be copied and pasted as well as detected by the web crawlers of various search engines (it could be the case that it has no affect on seo… but that’s a chance I don’t have to take).

### Part 2 of this series is the infinitely more comprehensive part 1 of the series:

<a href="https://medium.com/geekculture/bash-commands-that-save-time-920fb6ab9d0a" class="markup--anchor markup--mixtapeEmbed-anchor" title="https://medium.com/geekculture/bash-commands-that-save-time-920fb6ab9d0a"><strong>Bash Commands That Save Me Time and Frustration (Part 1)</strong><br />

### Update (more practical commands):

Find files that have been modified on your system in the past 60 minutes

    find / -mmin 60 -type f

Find all files larger than 20M

    find / -type f -size +20M

Find duplicate files (based on MD5 hash)

    find -type f -exec md5sum '{}' ';' | sort | uniq --all-repeated=separate -w 33

Change permission only for files

    cd /var/www/site && find . -type f -exec chmod 766 {} \;
    cd /var/www/site && find . -type f -exec chmod 664 {} +

Change permission only for directories

    cd /var/www/site && find . -type d -exec chmod g+x {} \;
    cd /var/www/site && find . -type d -exec chmod g+rwx {} +

Find files and directories for specific user/group

    # User:
    find . -user <username> -print
    find /etc -type f -user <username> -name "*.conf"
    Group:
    find /opt -group <group>

    find /etc -type f -group <group> -iname "*.conf"
    Find files and directories for all without specific user/group
    # User:
    find . \! -user <username> -print
    Group:
    find . ! -group <group>
    Looking for files/directories that only have certain permission
    # User
    find . -user <username> -perm -u+rw # -rw-r--r--
    find /home -user $(whoami) -perm 777 # -rwxrwxrwx
    Group:
    find /home -type d -group <group> -perm 755 # -rwxr-xr-x
    Delete older files than 60 days
    find . -type f -mtime +60 -delete

Recursively remove all empty sub-directories from a directory

    find . -depth  -type d  -empty -exec rmdir {} \;

How to find all hard links to a file

    find </path/to/dir> -xdev -samefile filename

Recursively find the latest modified files

    find . -type f -exec stat --format '%Y :%y %n' "{}" \; | sort -nr | cut -d: -f2- | head

Recursively find/replace of a string with sed

    find . -not -path '*/\.git*' -type f -print0 | xargs -0 sed -i 's/foo/bar/g'

Recursively find/replace of a string in directories and file names

    find . -depth -name '*test*' -execdir bash -c 'mv -v "$1" "${1//foo/bar}"' _ {} \;

Recursively find suid executables

    find / \( -perm -4000 -o -perm -2000 \) -type f -exec ls -la {} \;

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Update \#2:

    $ find -type f -exec grep -q "foo" {} \; -exec echo rm -- {} \;

This recursively searches for files containing `foo`. The second `-exec` is only run if the first `exec` exits successfully, i.e. if `grep` matches. Dryrun and remove the `echo` if the output seems correct.

Or alternatively

    $ find -type f -exec grep -q "foo" {} \; -print

and

    $ find -type f -exec grep -q "foo" {} \; -delete

LocalStorage VS SessionStorage
==============================

Web storage objects localStorage and sessionStorage allow to save key/value pairs in the browser.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### LocalStorage VS SessionStorage

Web storage objects `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` allow to save key/value pairs in the browser.

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*sJFEUTv2t9DsmpE2" class="graf-image" /></figure>What’s interesting about them is that the data survives a page refresh (for `sessionStorage`) and even a full browser restart (for `localStorage`). We’ll see that very soon.

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*NL5JYJqGcyQ7Q16P.png" class="graf-image" /></figure>We already have cookies. Why additional objects?

-   <span id="ceb3">Unlike cookies, web storage objects are not sent to server with each request. Because of that, we can store much more. Most browsers allow at least 2 megabytes of data (or more) and have settings to configure that.</span>
-   <span id="bff4">Also unlike cookies, the server can’t manipulate storage objects via HTTP headers. Everything’s done in JavaScript.</span>
-   <span id="ac8e">The storage is bound to the origin (domain/protocol/port triplet). That is, different protocols or subdomains infer different storage objects, they can’t access data from each other.</span>

Both storage objects provide same methods and properties:

-   <span id="63b8">`setItem(key, value)` – store key/value pair.</span>
-   <span id="72e2">`getItem(key)` – get the value by key.</span>
-   <span id="848a">`removeItem(key)` – remove the key with its value.</span>
-   <span id="b51e">`clear()` – delete everything.</span>
-   <span id="7c98">`key(index)` – get the key on a given position.</span>
-   <span id="ef56">`length` – the number of stored items.</span>

As you can see, it’s like a `Map` collection (`setItem/getItem/removeItem`), but also allows access by index with `key(index)`.

Let’s see how it works.

### localStorage demo

The main features of `localStorage` are:

-   <span id="73ee">Shared between all tabs and windows from the same origin.</span>
-   <span id="fc86">The data does not expire. It remains after the browser restart and even OS reboot.</span>

For instance, if you run this code…

    localStorage.setItem('test', 1);

…And close/open the browser or just open the same page in a different window, then you can get it like this:

    alert( localStorage.getItem('test') ); // 1

We only have to be on the same origin (domain/port/protocol), the url path can be different.

The `localStorage` is shared between all windows with the same origin, so if we set the data in one window, the change becomes visible in another one.

### Object-like access

We can also use a plain object way of getting/setting keys, like this:

    // set key
    localStorage.test = 2;
    // get key
    alert( localStorage.test ); // 2
    // remove key

    delete localStorage.test;
    That’s allowed for historical reasons, and mostly works, but generally not recommended, because:

    If the key is user-generated, it can be anything, like length or toString, or another built-in method of localStorage. In that case getItem/setItem work fine, while object-like access fails:

    let key = ‘length’; localStorage[key] = 5; // Error, can’t assign length

1.  <span id="3020">There’s a `storage` event, it triggers when we modify the data. That event does not happen for object-like access. We’ll see that later in this chapter.</span>

### Looping over keys

As we’ve seen, the methods provide “get/set/remove by key” functionality. But how to get all saved values or keys?

Unfortunately, storage objects are not iterable.

One way is to loop over them as over an array:

    for(let i=0; i<localStorage.length; i++) {
      let key = localStorage.key(i);
      alert(`${key}: ${localStorage.getItem(key)}`);
    }

Another way is to use `for key in localStorage` loop, just as we do with regular objects.

It iterates over keys, but also outputs few built-in fields that we don’t need:

    // bad try
    for(let key in localStorage) {
      alert(key); // shows getItem, setItem and other built-in stuff
    }

…So we need either to filter fields from the prototype with `hasOwnProperty` check:

    for(let key in localStorage) {
      if (!localStorage.hasOwnProperty(key)) {
        continue; // skip keys like "setItem", "getItem" etc
      }
      alert(`${key}: ${localStorage.getItem(key)}`);
    }

…Or just get the “own” keys with `Object.keys` and then loop over them if needed:

    let keys = Object.keys(localStorage);
    for(let key of keys) {
      alert(`${key}: ${localStorage.getItem(key)}`);
    }

The latter works, because `Object.keys` only returns the keys that belong to the object, ignoring the prototype.

### Strings only

Please note that both key and value must be strings.

If were any other type, like a number, or an object, it gets converted to string automatically:

    sessionStorage.user = {name: "John"};
    alert(sessionStorage.user); // [object Object]

We can use `JSON` to store objects though:

    sessionStorage.user = JSON.stringify({name: "John"});
    // sometime later

    let user = JSON.parse( sessionStorage.user );

    alert( user.name ); // John
    Also it is possible to stringify the whole storage object, e.g. for debugging purposes:
    // added formatting options to JSON.stringify to make the object look nicer
    alert( JSON.stringify(localStorage, null, 2) );

### sessionStorage

The `sessionStorage` object is used much less often than `localStorage`.

Properties and methods are the same, but it’s much more limited:

-   <span id="94a1">The `sessionStorage` exists only within the current browser tab.</span>
-   <span id="c149">Another tab with the same page will have a different storage.</span>
-   <span id="9a82">But it is shared between iframes in the same tab (assuming they come from the same origin).</span>
-   <span id="c0d7">The data survives page refresh, but not closing/opening the tab.</span>

Let’s see that in action.

Run this code…

    sessionStorage.setItem('test', 1);

…Then refresh the page. Now you can still get the data:

    alert( sessionStorage.getItem('test') ); // after refresh: 1

…But if you open the same page in another tab, and try again there, the code above returns `null`, meaning “nothing found”.

That’s exactly because `sessionStorage` is bound not only to the origin, but also to the browser tab. For that reason, `sessionStorage` is used sparingly.

### Storage event

When the data gets updated in `localStorage` or `sessionStorage`, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webstorage/#the-storage-event" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">storage</a> event triggers, with properties:

-   <span id="9c38">`key` – the key that was changed (`null` if `.clear()` is called).</span>
-   <span id="1cd8">`oldValue` – the old value (`null` if the key is newly added).</span>
-   <span id="df18">`newValue` – the new value (`null` if the key is removed).</span>
-   <span id="bda8">`url` – the url of the document where the update happened.</span>
-   <span id="cb21">`storageArea` – either `localStorage` or `sessionStorage` object where the update happened.</span>

The important thing is: the event triggers on all `window` objects where the storage is accessible, except the one that caused it.

Let’s elaborate.

Imagine, you have two windows with the same site in each. So `localStorage` is shared between them.

    You might want to open this page in two browser windows to test the code below.

If both windows are listening for `window.onstorage`, then each one will react on updates that happened in the other one.

    // triggers on updates made to the same storage from other documents
    window.onstorage = event => { // same as window.addEventListener('storage', event => {
      if (event.key != 'now') return;
      alert(event.key + ':' + event.newValue + " at " + event.url);
    };
    localStorage.setItem('now', Date.now());
    Please note that the event also contains: event.url – the url of the document where the data was updated.
    Also, event.storageArea contains the storage object – the event is the same for both sessionStorage and localStorage, so event.storageArea references the one that was modified. We may even want to set something back in it, to “respond” to a change.
    That allows different windows from the same origin to exchange messages.
    Modern browsers also support Broadcast channel API, the special API for same-origin inter-window communication, it’s more full featured, but less supported. There are libraries that polyfill that API, based on localStorage, that make it available everywhere.
    Summary
    Web storage objects localStorage and sessionStorage allow to store key/value in the browser.

    Both key and value must be strings.
    The limit is 5mb+, depends on the browser.
    They do not expire.
    The data is bound to the origin (domain/port/protocol).

    API:

    setItem(key, value) – store key/value pair.
    getItem(key) – get the value by key.
    removeItem(key) – remove the key with its value.
    clear() – delete everything.
    key(index) – get the key number index.
    length – the number of stored items.
    Use Object.keys to get all keys.
    We access keys as object properties, in that case storage event isn’t triggered.

    Storage event:

    Triggers on setItem, removeItem, clear calls.
    Contains all the data about the operation (key/oldValue/newValue), the document url and the storage object storageArea.
    Triggers on all window objects that have access to the storage except the one that generated it (within a tab for sessionStorage, globally for localStorage).

    Mini Review Of SQL For PostgreSQL W Node & Express
    What is a Query?

    Mini Review Of SQL For PostgreSQL W Node & Express
    What is a Query?



    Using Select
    What is a Query?

    Query : A question we’re asking a database, aiming to get a response back.
    psql -U postgres
    Let’s us access the postgres server as the user ‘postgres’
    -U stands for ‘user’.
    \q is used to quit postgres at any time.

    create table puppies (
      name VARCHAR(100),
      age_yrs NUMERIC(2,1),
      breed VARCHAR(100),
      weight_lbs INT,
      microchipped BOOLEAN
    );

    insert into puppies
    values
    ('Cooper', 1, 'Miniature Schnauzer', 18, 'yes');

    insert into puppies
    values
    ('Indie', 0.5, 'Yorkshire Terrier', 13, 'yes'),
    ('Kota', 0.7, 'Australian Shepherd', 26, 'no'),
    ('Zoe', 0.8, 'Korean Jindo', 32, 'yes'),
    ('Charley', 1.5, 'Basset Hound', 25, 'no'),
    ('Ladybird', 0.6, 'Labradoodle', 20, 'yes'),
    ('Callie', 0.9, 'Corgi', 16, 'no'),
    ('Jaxson', 0.4, 'Beagle', 19, 'yes'),
    ('Leinni', 1, 'Miniature Schnauzer', 25, 'yes' ),
    ('Max', 1.6, 'German Shepherd', 65, 'no');

-   <span id="2c10">SQL Data Types listed here:</span>
-   <span id="e3ef">`varchar(n)` : variable length char, n represents the limit.</span>
-   <span id="3af6">`numeric(p, s)` : floating point number, with *p* digits and *s* number of places after the decimal point.</span>
-   <span id="2eff">`int` : 4 byte integer.</span>
-   <span id="a736">`boolean` : regular boolean value.</span>
-   <span id="1ff4">`SELECT Query` : Query used to get results back from a table.</span>
-   <span id="d1a2">Syntax `SELECT [columns] FROM [table]`.</span>
-   <span id="d9bb">You can use `SELECT *` to get all rows back in a given table.</span>
-   <span id="96d6">To select multiple columns you could use:</span>

<!-- -->

    SELECT name , age_yrs , weight_lbs FROM puppies;

-   <span id="9e78">It is recommended to perform queries with multi-line formatting because column selection can become very long.</span>
-   <span id="16a2">Also if you format it like this you can easily comment out certain columns with double dash.</span>

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*tj99LLWFAJYMoZIf" class="graf-image" /></figure>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### USING WHERE

**Using SELECT and WHERE**

-   <span id="43bf">We can filter our information from our SELECT queries by using WHERE.</span>

**WHERE clause for a single value**

    SELECT name, breed FROM puppies
      WHERE breed = 'Corgi';

-   <span id="d62e">Note that the string must use single quotation marks because PostgreSQL will convert all names to lowercase unless DOUBLE quoted.</span>

**WHERE clause for a list of values**

    SELECT name, breed FROM puppies
      WHERE breed IN ('Corgi', 'Beagle', 'Yorkshire Terrier');

-   <span id="94cc">Use the structure WHERE \[col\] IN (‘val’, ‘val2’…)</span>

**WHERE clause for a range of values**

    SELECT name, breed, age_yrs FROM puppies
      WHERE age_yrs BETWEEN 0 AND 0.6;

**ORDER BY**

-   <span id="b401">You can use `Order By` to get back your data in a specified way.</span>

<!-- -->

    SELECT name, breed
    FROM puppies
    ORDER BY age_yrs DESC;

**LIMIT and OFFSET**

-   <span id="3943">You can limit the amount of rows returned by using the LIMIT keyword.</span>

<!-- -->

    SELECT name, breed
    FROM puppies
    ORDER BY age_yrs
    LIMIT 100 OFFSET 100;

-   <span id="7340">You can on the OFFSET keyword after LIMIT to retrieve the next 100 after the LIMIT clause.</span>

**SQL operators**

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*u9zQKiyH8RiwHczk.png" class="graf-image" /></figure>SELECT name, breed FROM puppies WHERE breed NOT IN (‘Miniature Schnauzer’, ‘Basset Hound’, ‘Labradoodle’) AND breed NOT LIKE ‘%Shepherd’;

-   <span id="f700">Example of a query with a WHERE clause using several logical operators.</span>
-   <span id="d31c">The % is a wildcard.</span>

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*662qwyPcdX2fxy6Q.png" class="graf-image" /></figure>-   <span id="d0b9">You can also use mathematical operators in WHERE clauses.</span>

<!-- -->

    SELECT name, breed, age_yrs FROM puppies
      WHERE age_yrs * 10 = 6;

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*FbpEHXEfQGBl9B2w.png" class="graf-image" /></figure>-   <span id="9442">You can also use comparison operators.</span>

<!-- -->

    SELECT name, breed, weight_lbs FROM puppies
      WHERE weight_lbs > 50;

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Using INSERT

-   <span id="8b98">Used to add data into a table.</span>

<!-- -->

    INSERT INTO table_name
    VALUES
      (column1_value, colum2_value, column3_value);

    INSERT INTO friends (first_name, last_name)
    VALUES
    ('Rose', 'Tyler'),
    ('Martha', 'Jones'),
    ('Donna', 'Noble'),
    ('River', 'Song');

-   <span id="2291">Note the use of single quotation marks for string values.</span>
-   <span id="810d">DEFAULT can be used in lieu of our SERIAL pseudo type.</span>
-   <span id="94af">You can do multiple insert by first specifying the column names and the adding in the data wrapped in parenthesis seperated by a comma.</span>

### Using INNER JOIN

-   <span id="8c61">Relationships are key in RD’s.</span>
-   <span id="b080">We create table associations through *foreign keys* and *primary keys*.</span>

<!-- -->

    SELECT * FROM puppies
    INNER JOIN breeds ON (puppies.breed_id = breeds.id);

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Using Seed Files

**Writing And Running A Seed File In PSQL**

-   <span id="bf27">Seeding is the act of populating a database with data.</span>

**Creating a seed file**

-   <span id="b5dd">Start by making a seed file in your IDE with `.sql` file type.</span>

<!-- -->

    CREATE TABLE pies (
      flavor VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,
      price FLOAT
    );

    INSERT INTO pies VALUES('Apple', 19.95);
    INSERT INTO pies VALUES('Caramel Apple Crumble', 20.53);
    INSERT INTO pies VALUES('Blueberry', 19.31);
    INSERT INTO pies VALUES('Blackberry', 22.86);
    INSERT INTO pies VALUES('Cherry', 22.32);
    INSERT INTO pies VALUES('Peach', 20.45);
    INSERT INTO pies VALUES('Raspberry', 20.99);
    INSERT INTO pies VALUES('Mixed Berry', 21.45);

**Populating a database via &lt; (“left caret”)**

-   <span id="0880">Syntax :  
    `psql -d [database] < [path_to_file/file.sql]`  
    `psql -d bakery < path_to_my_file/seed-data.sql`</span>

**Populating the database via | (“pipe”)**

-   <span id="e1ff">Syntax :  
    `cat [path_to_file/file.sql] | psql -d [database]`  
    `cat path_to_my_file/seed-data.sql | psql -d postgres`</span>

### Relational Database Design

### Creating a Schema For Relational Database Design

-   <span id="ab7f">Schemas allow us to easily visualize database tables and their relationships to one another.</span>

**What is Relational Database Design?**

-   <span id="c8bd">**RDD** : Relational Database Design differs from other Databases because data is organized into tables and all types of data access are carried out via controlled transactions.</span>
-   <span id="088e">Remember: Tables = Entities, Rows = Records, Columns = Fields.</span>

**Stages of Relational Database Design**

1.  <span id="62c5">`Define the purpose & entitites of the Relational DB.`</span>

-   <span id="e1e7">Why is the database being created?</span>
-   <span id="dcfc">What problem is it solving?</span>
-   <span id="d2b6">What is the data used for?</span>

1.  <span id="0784">`Identify the Primary keys.`</span>

-   <span id="8d90">Identify the PK of each table.</span>

1.  <span id="0ec6">`Establish Table Relationships.`</span>

-   <span id="93f7">There are theee types of relational database table relationships:</span>

1.  <span id="c34b">**One-To-One**</span>

-   <span id="e3aa">One record in a table is associated with only one record in another table.</span>
-   <span id="258f">The least common type of table relationship.</span>

1.  <span id="1afc">**One-To-Many**</span>

-   <span id="ffbf">Each record in a table is associated with multiple records in another table.</span>

1.  <span id="f087">**Many-To-Many**</span>

-   <span id="69de">Multiple records in one table are associated with multiple records in another table.</span>
-   <span id="3c48">Usually we would create a third table for this relationship called a `join             table`</span>

1.  <span id="f73a">`Apply Normalization Rules.`</span>

-   <span id="16ec">`Normalization` : Process of optimizing the database structure so that redundancy and confusion are eliminated.</span>
-   <span id="6e1e">Rules are called ‘normal forms’</span>

1.  <span id="950c">First normal form.</span>

-   <span id="6915">Eliminate repeating groups in tables.</span>
-   <span id="ced9">Create sep. table for each set of related data.</span>
-   <span id="98cd">ID each set of related data with a primary key.</span>

1.  <span id="2cb4">Second normal form.</span>

-   <span id="8a62">Create sep. tables for sets of values that apply to multiple records.</span>
-   <span id="7ad9">Related these tables with a foreign key.</span>

1.  <span id="7c97">Third normal form.</span>

-   <span id="a141">Eliminate fields that do not depend on the table’s key.</span>

1.  <span id="6611">Boyce-Codd normal form.</span>
2.  <span id="e505">Fifth normal form.</span>

-   <span id="49d0">The first three are widely used in practice and the fourth/fifth less so.</span>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Transactions

-   <span id="d642">Using Transactions allow us to make changes to a SQL database in a consistent and durable way, and it is considered best practice to use them regularly.</span>
-   <span id="bf44">`Transaction` : Single unit of work, which can contain multiple operations, performed on a database.</span>
-   <span id="708d">Bundles multiple steps into a single, all-or-nothing operation.</span>

**Implicit vs. explicit transactions**

-   <span id="2c5c">Technically every SQL statement is a transaction.</span>

<!-- -->

    INSERT INTO hobbits(name,purpose)
      VALUES('Frodo','Destroy the One Ring of power.');

-   <span id="c72a">This statement would be a `implicit` transaction.</span>
-   <span id="6a91">On the flip side `explicit` transactions will allow us to create save points and roll back to whatever point in time we choose.</span>

**PostgreSQL transactional commands**

-   <span id="7400">`BEGIN` : Initiates a transaction block. All Statements after a BEGIN command will be executed in a single transaction until COMMIT or ROLLBACK is called.</span>

<!-- -->

    BEGIN;
      INSERT INTO hobbits(name,purpose)
        VALUES('Frodo','Destroy the One Ring of power.');

-   <span id="ae31">`COMMIT` : Commits a current transaction, all changes made by this transaction become visible to others and are guaranteed to be durable if a crash occurs.</span>

<!-- -->

    BEGIN;
      INSERT INTO hobbits(name,purpose)
        VALUES('Frodo','Destroy the One Ring of power.');
    COMMIT;

-   <span id="a20c">`ROLLBACK` : Rolls back current transaction and removes all updates made by the transaction.</span>

<!-- -->

    BEGIN;
      INSERT INTO hobbits(name,purpose)
        VALUES('Frodo','Destroy the One Ring of power.');
    ROLLBACK;

-   <span id="0aa4">`SAVEPOINT` : Establishes a new save point within the current transaction.</span>

<!-- -->

    BEGIN;
      DELETE FROM fellowship
        WHERE age > 100;
      SAVEPOINT first_savepoint;
      DELETE FROM fellowship
        WHERE age > 80;
      DELETE FROM fellowship
        WHERE age >= 40;
      ROLLBACK TO first_savepoint;
    COMMIT;

-   <span id="5b46">`SET TRANSACTION` : Sets the characteristics of the current transaction.</span>

<!-- -->

    BEGIN;
      SET TRANSACTION READ ONLY;
      ...
    COMMIT;

**When to use transactions and why**

-   <span id="2649">Good to use when making any updates, insertions, or deletions to a database.</span>
-   <span id="9ade">Help us deal with crashes, failures, data consistency, and error handling.</span>
-   <span id="0228">`Atomicity` is another feature that is a benefit of transactions.</span>

**Transaction properties: ACID**

-   <span id="1cd4">A SQL transaction has four properties known collectively as `ACID` (Atomic, Consistent, Isolated, and Durable)</span>
-   <span id="7c59">`Atomicity` : All changes to data are performed as if they are a single operation.</span>
-   <span id="1e1b">You can also refer to the A as ‘Abortability’</span>
-   <span id="34fa">I.E. if an app transfers funds from one account to another, the atomic nature of transactions will ensure that if a debt is successfully made, the credit will be properly transferred.</span>
-   <span id="1be1">`Consistency` : Data is in a consistent start when a transaction starts and ends.</span>
-   <span id="0ffb">I.E. if a transfer is scheduled, this prop ensures total value of funds in both accounts is the same at the start and end of a transaction.</span>
-   <span id="bc89">`Isolation` : Intermediate state of a transaction is invisible to othe rtransactioned, they appear to be serialized.</span>
-   <span id="ce2d">I.E. continuing our money transfer example, when a transfer occurs this prop ensures that transactions can see funds in one account or the other BUT NOT both NOR neither.</span>
-   <span id="8fcd">`Durable` : After a transaction successfully completes, changes to data persists and are not undone even in system failure.</span>
-   <span id="cb8d">I.E. this prop ensures our transaction will success and cannot be reversed in the event of a failure.</span>

**Banking transaction example**

    BEGIN;
      UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100.00
          WHERE name = 'Alice';
      UPDATE branches SET balance = balance - 100.00
          WHERE name = (SELECT branch_name FROM accounts WHERE name = 'Alice');
      UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100.00
          WHERE name = 'Bob';
      UPDATE branches SET balance = balance + 100.00
          WHERE name = (SELECT branch_name FROM accounts WHERE name = 'Bob');
    COMMIT;

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Subqueries and JOINs

**Joins vs. Subqueries**  
**What is a JOIN?**

-   <span id="6e9d">JOIN allows us to retrieve rows from multiple tables.</span>

<!-- -->

    SELECT * FROM puppies
    INNER JOIN breeds ON (puppies.breed_id = breeds.id);

-   <span id="c49e">There are a few different types of JOIN operations:</span>
-   <span id="405d">`Inner Join` : Returns results containing rows in the left table that match rows in the right table.</span>
-   <span id="10a2">`Left Join` : Returns a set of results containing all rows from the left table with the matching rows from the right table. If there is no match, the right side will have null values.</span>
-   <span id="6b72">`Right Join` : Returns a set of results containing all rows from the right table with the matching rows from the left table. If there is no match, the left side will have null values.</span>
-   <span id="30f3">`Full Outer Join` : Returns a set of results containing all rows from both the left and right tables, with matching rows from both sides where avail. If there is no match the missing side contains null values.</span>
-   <span id="cb22">`Self-Join` : Query in which a table is joined to itslef, useful for comparing values in a column of rows within the same table.</span>

**What is a subquery?**

-   <span id="29b8">A SELECT statement nested inside another SELECT statement.</span>

<!-- -->

    postgres=# SELECT * FROM puppies;
     id |   name   | age_yrs | breed_id | weight_lbs | microchipped
    ----+----------+---------+----------+------------+--------------
      1 | Cooper   |     1.0 |        8 |         18 | t
      2 | Indie    |     0.5 |        9 |         13 | t
      3 | Kota     |     0.7 |        1 |         26 | f
      4 | Zoe      |     0.8 |        6 |         32 | t
      5 | Charley  |     1.5 |        2 |         25 | f
      6 | Ladybird |     0.6 |        7 |         20 | t
      7 | Callie   |     0.9 |        4 |         16 | f
      8 | Jaxson   |     0.4 |        3 |         19 | t
      9 | Leinni   |     1.0 |        8 |         25 | t
     10 | Max      |     1.6 |        5 |         65 | f
    (10 rows)

    SELECT
      puppies.name,
      age_yrs,
      breeds.name
    FROM
      puppies
    INNER JOIN
      breeds ON (breeds.id = puppies.breed_id)
    WHERE
      age_yrs > (
        SELECT
          AVG (age_yrs)
        FROM
          puppies
      );

**Multiple-row subquery**

    SELECT *
    FROM friends
    WHERE
      puppy_id IN (
        SELECT puppy_id
        FROM puppies
        WHERE
          age_yrs < 0.6
      );

-   <span id="9abf">We can also use a JOIN operation instead of the WHERE clause like in the above example.</span>

<!-- -->

    SELECT *
    FROM friends
    INNER JOIN puppies ON (puppies.puppy_id = friends.puppy_id)
    WHERE
      puppies.age_yrs < 0.6;

**Should I use a JOIN or a subquery?**

-   <span id="569f">Joins are better when you want to combine rows from one or more tables based on a match condition.</span>
-   <span id="3175">Subqueries work great when you’re only returning a single value.</span>
-   <span id="b6fb">When returning multiple rows, you could go with either subQ’s or joins.</span>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Indexes and Performance Analysis

-   <span id="fc7a">`PostgreSQL Index` : Works similarly like an index in the back of a book, they provide special lookup tables to let us make faster database queries.</span>
-   <span id="cb65">The Syntax for creating index is as follows:</span>

<!-- -->

    CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name (column_name);

    CREATE INDEX addresses_phone_index ON addresses (phone_number);

    DROP INDEX addresses_phone_index;

**Types of indexes**

There are several types of indexes use in Postgres: B-tree, Hash, GiST, and GIN.

-   <span id="19e4">`Single-Column Indexes` Uses only one table column.</span>
-   <span id="d09d">`CREATE INDEX addresses_phone_index ON addresses (phone_number);`</span>
-   <span id="31d2">`Multiple-Column Indexes` Uses more than one table column.</span>
-   <span id="d219">`CREATE INDEX idx_addresses_city_post_code ON table_name (city_id,             postal_code);`</span>
-   <span id="c2ad">`Partial Indexes` Uses subset of a table defined by a conditional expression.</span>
-   <span id="37df">`CREATE INDEX addresses_phone_index ON addresses (phone_number) WHERE (city_id =             2);`</span>

**When to use an index**

-   <span id="e4ea">Overall DB indexes are known to enhance performance when performing queries, however there are certain situations where it is not recommended:</span>
-   <span id="7095">When working with small tables.</span>
-   <span id="5829">When table has large batch updates or insert operations.</span>
-   <span id="d017">When working with columns that have many NULL values.</span>
-   <span id="a1d6">When working with columns that are frequently manipulated.</span>
-   <span id="9bdf">Using EXPLAIN and ANALYZE keywords can give us performance data of our queries.</span>

<!-- -->

Modules in Javascript
=====================

Differences between Node.js and browsers

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Modules in Javascript

#### **Differences between Node.js and browsers**

There are many differences between Node.js and browser environments, but many of them are small and inconsequential in practice. For example, in our *Asynchronous* lesson, we noted how <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/timers.html#timers_settimeout_callback_delay_args" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">Node’s setTimeout</a> has a slightly different return value from <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/setTimeout" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">a browser’s setTimeout</a>. Let’s go over a few notable differences between the two environments.

**Global vs Window**

In the Node.js runtime, the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Global_object" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">global object</a> is the object where global variables are stored. In browsers, the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">window object</a> is where global variables are stored. The window also includes properties and methods that deal with drawing things on the screen like images, links, and buttons. Node doesn’t need to draw anything, and so it does not come with such properties. This means that you can’t reference window in Node.

*Most browsers allow you to reference global but it is really the same object as window.*

**Document**

Browsers have access to a document object that contains the HTML of a page that will be rendered to the browser window. There is no document in Node.

**Location**

Browsers have access to a location that contains information about the web address being visited in the browser. There is no location in Node, since it is not on the web.

**Require and module.exports**

Node has a predefined require function that we can use to import installed modules like readline. We can also import and export across our own files using require and module.exports. For example, say we had two different files, animals.js and cat.js, that existed in the same directory:

If we execute animals.js in Node, the program would print ‘Sennacy is a great pet!’.

Browsers don’t have a notion of a file system so we cannot use require or module.exports in the same way.

### The fs module

Node comes with an <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">fs module</a> that contains methods that allow us to interact with our computer’s **F**ile **S**ystem through JavaScript. No additional installations are required; to access this module we can simply `require` it. We recommend that you code along with this reading. Let’s begin with a `change-some-files.js` script that imports the module:

    // change-some-files.js
    const fs = require("fs");
    Similar to what we saw in the readline lesson, require will return to us a object with many properties that will enable us to do file I/O.
    Did you know? I/O is short for input/output. It’s usage is widespread and all the hip tech companies are using it, like.io.
    The fs module contains tons of functionality! Chances are that if there is some operation you need to perform regarding files, the fs module supports it. The module also offers both synchronous and asynchronous implementations of these methods. We prefer to not block the thread and so we’ll opt for the asynchronous flavors of these methods.
    Creating a new file
    To create a file, we can use the writeFile method. According to the documentation, there are a few ways to use it. The most straight forward way is:
    The code acreate-a-nnew-file.js (github.com)bove will create a new file called foo.txt in the same directory as our change-some-file.js script. It will write the string 'Hello world!' into that newly created file. The third argument specifies the encoding of the characters. There are different ways to encode characters; UTF-8 is the most common and you’ll use this in most scenarios. The fourth argument to writeFile is a callback that will be invoked when the write operation is complete. The docs indicate that if there is an error during the operation (such as an invalid encoding argument), an error object will be passed into the callback. This type of error handling is quite common for asynchronous functions. Like we are used to, since writeFile is asynchronous, we need to utilize callback chaining if we want to guarantee that commands occur after the write is complete or fails.
    Beware! If the file name specified to writeFile already exists, it will completely overwrite the contents of that file.
    We won’t be using the foo.txt file in the rest of this reading.
    Reading existing files
    To explore how to read a file, we’ll use VSCode to manually create a poetry.txt file within the same directory as our change-some-file.js script. Be sure to create this if you are following along.
    Our poetry.txt file will contain the following lines:
    My code fails
    I do not know why
    My code works
    I do not know why
    We can use the readFile method to read the contents of this file. The method accepts very similar arguments to writeFile, except that the callback may be passed an error object and string containing the file contents. In the snippet below, we have replaced our previous writeFile code with readFile:

    Running the code above would print the following in the terminal:

    THE CONTENTS ARE:
    My code fails
    I do not know why
    My code works
    I do not know why
    Success! From here, you can do anything you please with the data read from the file. For example, since data is a string, we could split the string on the newline character \n to obtain an array of the file’s lines:
    THE CONTENTS ARE:
    [ 'My code fails',
    'I do not know why',
    'My code works',
    'I do not know why' ]
    The third line is My code works
    File I/O
    Using the same poetry.txt file from before:
    My code fails
    I do not know why
    My code works
    I do not know why
    Let’s replace occurrences of the phrase ‘do not’ with the word ‘should’.
    We can read the contents of the file as a string, manipulate this string, then write this new string back into the file.
    We’ll need to utilize callback chaining in order for this to work since our file I/O is asynchronous:
    Executing the script above will edit the poetry.txt file to contain:
    My code fails
    I should know why
    My code works
    I should know why

    Mutability And Reference VS Privative Types in JavaScript
    Mutability && Primitive && Reference Examples

    Mutability And Reference VS Privative Types in JavaScript
    Mutability && Primitive && Reference Examples



    Mutability
    In JavaScript, String values are immutable, which means that they cannot be altered once created.
    For example, the following code:
    var myStr = "Bob";
    myStr[0] = "J";

cannot change the value of `myStr` to `Job`, because the contents of `myStr` cannot be altered. Note that this does *not* mean that `myStr` cannot be changed, just that the individual characters of a string literal cannot be changed. The only way to change `myStr` would be to assign it with a new string, like this:

    var myStr = "Bob";
    myStr = "Job";

### Objects are passed by reference, are mutable, and can be modified by our functions:

    function rotateLeft(arr, num) {
        for (let i = 0; i < num; i++) {
            let el = arr.pop();
            arr.unshift(el);
        }
    }
    let myArr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ];
    rotateLeft(myArr, 2);
    console.log(myArr);

Strings are passed by value, are immutable, and a new array is constructed and returned, because it cannot be changed in place.

    function rotateString(str, num) {
        return str.slice(num) + str.slice(0, num);
    }
    let str = "foobar";

    let ret = rotateString(str, 3);

    console.log(str);

    console.log(ret);
    Dereferencing
    Arrays
    To dereference an array, use let [var1, var2] syntax.
    let arr = ['one', 'two', 'three'];
    let [first] = arr;

    console.log(first);
    Objects
    To dereference attributes from an object, use let {} syntax.

    Object Oriented Programming in JavaScript
    Object-Oriented Programming

    Object Oriented Programming in JavaScript
    Object-Oriented Programming



    Overview:
    Encapsulation

    The mechanism that puts behavior and data together behind methods that hide the specific implementation of a class.

    How can a CommonJS Module import functionality from another module?

    Through the use of the require function.

    How can an ES6 module import functionality from another module?

    Through the use of the import-from syntax that looks like this:
    import SymbolName from './relative-path.js';

    How do CommonJS Modules allow other modules to access exported symbols?

    Through the use of the module.exports property.

    How do ES6 Modules export functionality so other modules can use them?

    Through the use of the export keyword.

    Implementation inheritance

    The data and methods defined on a parent class are available on objects created from classes that inherit from those parent classes

    Inheritance

    The mechanism that passes traits of a parent class to its descendants.

    Prototypal inheritance

    A method of realizing implementation inheritance through process of finding missing properties on an object by delegating the resolution to a prototype object.

    The constructor method

    The special method of a class that is called to initialize an object when code uses the new keyword to instantiate an object from that class.

    The Dependency Inversion Principle

    Functionality that your class depends on should be provided as parameters to methods rather than using new in the class to create a new instance of a dependency.

    The extends keyword

    The keyword in JavaScript that allows one class to inherit from another.

    The Interface Segregation Principle

    Method names should be grouped together into granular collections called “interfaces”

    The Law Of Demeter

    Don’t use more than one dot (not counting the one after “this”).
    A method of an object can only invoke the methods (or use the properties) of the following kinds of objects: Methods on the object itself Any of the objects passed in as parameters to the method And object created in the method Any values stored in the instance variables of the object Any values stored in global variables

    The Liskov Substitution Principle

    You can substitute child class objects for parent class objects and not cause errors.

    The Open-Close Principle

    A class is open for extension and closed for modification.

    The Single-Responsibility Principle

    Any one of the following:
    A class should do one thing and do it well.
    A class should have only one reason to change.
    Gather together the things that change for the same reasons. Separate those things that change for different reasons.


    Background:
    Constructor Functions
    Defining a constructor function Example of an object using object initialization
    const fellowshipOfTheRing = {
      title: "The Fellowship of the Ring",
      series: "The Lord of the Rings",
      author: "J.R.R. Tolkien",
    };

-   <span id="9071">The above literal is a “Book” object type.</span>
-   <span id="a5d6">`Object Type` is defined by it’s attributes and behaviors.</span>

> `Behaviors` **are represented by methods.**

-   <span id="ccb5">`Constructor Functions` : Handle the creation of an object - it’s a factory for creating objects of a specific type.</span>
-   <span id="bdc9">There are a few specific things to constructors worth noting:</span>
-   <span id="6549">***The name of the constructor function is capitalized***</span>
-   <span id="8e61">The Function *does not explicitly return a value*</span>
-   <span id="8d48">Within the body, the *this* keyword references the newly created object</span>

<!-- -->

    function Book(title, series, author) {
      this.title = title;
      this.series = series;
      this.author = author;
    }

### Invoking a constructor function

-   <span id="dc26">We can invoke a constructor function using the `new` keyword.</span>

<!-- -->

    function Book(title, series, author) {
      this.title = title;
      this.series = series;
      this.author = author;
    }

    const fellowshipOfTheRing = new Book(
      "The Fellowship of the Ring",
      "The Lord of the Rings",
      "J.R.R. Tolkien"
    );

    console.log(fellowshipOfTheRing); // Book { title: 'The Fellowship of the Ring', ... }

### *Four Things will happen when invoking a constructor function*

1.  <span id="b127">A new empty object is created {};</span>
2.  <span id="3c79">The new obj’s `prototype` is set to the object referenced by the constructors prototype property.</span>
3.  <span id="6b2e">`This` is bound to the new object.</span>
4.  <span id="a360">The new object is returned after the constructor function has completed.</span>

### Understanding New Object Instances

-   <span id="1263">`Instance` : term to describe an objected created from a constructor function.</span>
-   <span id="6916">Every instance created is a unique object and therefore not equal to each other.</span>

### Using the instanceof operator to check an object’s type

    console.log(fellowshipOfTheRing instanceof Book); // true

-   <span id="f5e2">By using the `instanceof` operator we can verify that an object was created from a certain object type.</span>
-   <span id="9d20">*The instanceOf operator works by checking to see if the prototype object of the left side of the operator is the same as the prototype object of the right side of the operator.*</span>

### Invoking a constructor function without the new keyword

-   <span id="e812">If we invoke a constructor function without the `new` keyword, we may result in one of two unexpected outcomes:</span>

1.  <span id="c067">In non-strict mode, this will be bound to the global object instead.</span>
2.  <span id="8654">In `strict` mode, this will become undefined.</span>

-   <span id="4f03">You can enable strict mode by typing `"use strict"` at the top of your file.</span>

### Defining Sharable Methods

-   <span id="0f4e">*Avoid the temptation to store an object method inside a constructor function, it is inefficient with computer memory usage b/c each object instance would have it’s own method definition.*</span>
-   <span id="a9e8">`Prototype` : An object that is delegated to when a reference to an object property or method can’t be resolved.</span>
-   <span id="ddc6">Every instance created by a constructor function shares the same prototype.</span>
-   <span id="ddba">`Object.setPrototypeOf()` and `Object.getPrototypeOf()` are just used to set a prototype of one object to another object; and also the verify a prototype.</span>
-   <span id="144c">`proto` : aka “dunder proto” is a property used to gain easy access to an object’s prototype - it is widely supported by browsers but is considered deprecated.</span>

<!-- -->

    function Book(title, series, author) {
      this.title = title;
      this.series = series;
      this.author = author;
    }

    // Any method defined on the `Book.prototype` property
    // will be shared across all `Book` instances.
    Book.prototype.getInformation = function () {
      return `${this.title} by ${this.author}`;
    };

    const fellowshipOfTheRing = new Book(
      "The Fellowship of the Ring",
      "The Lord of the Rings",
      "J.R.R. Tolkien"
    );

    console.log(fellowshipOfTheRing.getInformation());

-   <span id="455e">Every method we define on a constructor function’s prototype property will be shared across all instances of that object type.</span>

The Problem with Arrow Functions

-   <span id="6cb0">We cannot use arrow functions when defining methods on a constructor function’s prototype property.</span>
-   <span id="4f33">Arrow functions don’t include their own this binding; therefore it will not reference the current instance — always stick with the function () keyword.</span>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Putting the Class in JavaScript Classes

In ES2015, JS gained the `class` keyword - replacing the need to use only constructor functions & prototypes to mimic classes!

-   <span id="df3e">`class` : keyword that gives developers a formal way to create a class definition to specify an object type’s attributes and behavior; also used to create objects of that specific type.</span>

Defining a ES2015 class

    class Book {
      constructor(title, series, author) {
        this.title = title;
        this.series = series;
        this.author = author;
      }
    }

-   <span id="951e">Class names also begin only with capital letters.</span>
-   <span id="28ed">Although not required, class definitions can include a `class constructor function` - these are similar to regular constructors in that:</span>
-   <span id="a4b1">They don’t explicitly return a value.</span>
-   <span id="e85e">The this keyword references the newly created object instance.</span>

### Instantiating an instance of a class

> We can also use the `new`.

### Four things occur when instantiating an instance of a class:

1.  <span id="8842">New empty object is created {};</span>
2.  <span id="1cd6">The new obj’s prototype is set to the class prototype’s property value.</span>
3.  <span id="eddc">`This` is bound to the new object.</span>
4.  <span id="0814">After the constructor method has completed, the new obj is returned.</span>

-   <span id="e722">**Don’t try to instatiate a class object without the new keyword.**</span>

#### Class Definitions are NOT hoisted

    test();
    function test() {

    console.log("This works!");

    }

    In JS you can call a function before it’s declared — this is known as hoisting.
    Class definitions are NOT hoisted, so just get in the habit of declaring them before you use them.

    Defining Methods

    A class can contain two types of methods:
    Instance Method : Methods that are invoked on an instance of the class - useful for performing an action on a specific instance.
    Instance methods are also sometimes referred to as prototype methods because they are defined on a shared prototype object.
    Static Method : Methods that invoked directly on a class, not on an instance.
    Important: Invoking a static method on an instance will result in a runtime error.
    Prepending the static keyword at the beginning on the method name will make it static.

    class Book {
      constructor(title, series, author) {
        this.title = title;
        this.series = series;
        this.author = author;
      }

      // Notice the use of a rest parameter (...books)
      // to capture the passed parameters as an array of values.
      static getTitles(...books) {
        return books.map((book) => book.title);
      }

      getInformation() {
        return `${this.title} by ${this.author}`;
      }
    }

    const fellowshipOfTheRing = new Book(
      "The Fellowship of the Ring",
      "The Lord of the Rings",
      "J.R.R. Tolkien"
    );

    const theTwoTowers = new Book(
      "The Two Towers",
      "The Lord of the Rings",
      "J.R.R. Tolkien"
    );

    const bookTitles = Book.getTitles(fellowshipOfTheRing, theTwoTowers);

    console.log(bookTitles.join(", ")); // The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers

-   <span id="133d">If we go back to an example of how constructor functions also use static methods — we see that static methods are *defined directly on the constructor function* — whereas instance methods need to be defined on the *prototype* object.</span>

<!-- -->

    function Book(title, series, author) {
      this.title = title;
      this.series = series;
      this.author = author;
    }

    // Static methods are defined
    // directly on the constructor function.
    Book.getTitles = function (...books) {
      return books.map((book) => book.title);
    };

    // Instance methods are defined
    // on the constructor function's `prototype` property.
    Book.prototype.getInformation = function () {
      return `${this.title} by ${this.author}`;
    };

    const fellowshipOfTheRing = new Book(
      "The Fellowship of the Ring",
      "The Lord of the Rings",
      "J.R.R. Tolkien"
    );

    const theTwoTowers = new Book(
      "The Two Towers",
      "The Lord of the Rings",
      "J.R.R. Tolkien"
    );

    console.log(fellowshipOfTheRing.getInformation()); // The Fellowship of the Ring by J.R.R. Tolkien

    console.log(theTwoTowers.getInformation()); // The Two Towers by J.R.R. Tolkien

    // Call the static `Book.getTitles()` method
    // to get an array of the book titles.
    const bookTitles = Book.getTitles(fellowshipOfTheRing, theTwoTowers);

    console.log(bookTitles.join(", ")); // The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers

### Comparing Classes to Constructor Functions

> *ES2015 Classes are essentially* ***syntactic sugar*** *over traditional constructor functions and prototypes.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Javascript Inheritance

-   <span id="76a3">`Child Class` : Class that is based upon another class and inherits properties and methods from that other class.</span>
-   <span id="9c4b">`Parent Class` : Class that is being inherited downwards.</span>
-   <span id="673c">`Inheritance` : The process of basing a class upon another class.</span>

<!-- -->

    class CatalogItem {
      constructor(title, series) {
        this.title = title;
        this.series = series;
      }

      getInformation() {
        if (this.series) {
          return `${this.title} (${this.series})`;
        } else {
          return this.title;
        }
      }
    }

    class Book extends CatalogItem {
      constructor(title, series, author) {
        super(title, series);
        this.author = author;
      }
    }

    class Movie extends CatalogItem {
      constructor(title, series, director) {
        super(title, series);
        this.director = director;

    const theGrapesOfWrath = new Book(

    );
    const aNewHope = new Movie(

    console.log(theGrapesOfWrath.getInformation()); // The Grapes of Wrath
    console.log(aNewHope.getInformation()); // Episode 4: A New Hope (Star Wars)
    console.log(Catalogitem instanceof Function); // true
    console.log(Book instanceof Function); // true

-   <span id="8dcd">A `prototype chain` defines a series of prototype objects that are delegated to one by one, when a property or method can’t be found on an instance object.</span>

<!-- -->

    console.log(theGrapesOfWrath.getInformation()); // The Grapes of Wrath

-   <span id="cdf9">When the `getInformation()` method is invoked:</span>
-   <span id="7d03">JS looks for get() on the current object.</span>
-   <span id="c65f">If it isn’t found, the method call is delegated to the object’s prototype.</span>
-   <span id="7ff3">It continues up the prototype chain until the method is found.</span>

Overriding a method in a parent class

-   <span id="71f7">`Method Overriding` : when a child class provides an implementation of a method that’s already defined in a parent class.</span>

<!-- -->

    class Movie extends CatalogItem {
      constructor(title, series, director) {

      getInformation() {
        let result = super.getInformation();

        if (this.director) {
          result += ` [directed by ${this.director}]`;
        }

      }
    }

-   <span id="68fd">We can simply declare our own method of the same name in our child class to override our parent’s version of `getInformation()`</span>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### JavaScript Modules

Introducing Node.js modules

-   <span id="7869">In Node.js, each JS file in a project defines a `module`.</span>
-   <span id="fdaa">Module’s contents are private by default.</span>
-   <span id="1ee7">`Local Modules` : Modules defined within your project.</span>
-   <span id="47f2">`Core Modules` : Native modules contained within Node.js that you can use to perform tasks or to add functionality to your application.</span>
-   <span id="dc6e">`CommonJS` : A legacy module system.</span>
-   <span id="20cd">`ES Modules` : Newer module sysem that will eventually replace CommonJS.</span>
-   <span id="5889">`Entry Point` : JS File that is passed to Node for access to the entire application.</span>

### Syntax for exporting modules:

    module.exports.Book = Book; module.exports.Movie = Movie;
    module.exports = { Book, Movie, };
    Syntax for importing modules:
    const classes = require(“./classes”);
    const { Book, Movie } = require(“./classes”);
    Using Single Item Modules

    Following the convention of a single exported item per module helps to keep modules focused and less likely to become bloted with too much code.

    Understanding Module Loading

    When loading a module, Node will examine the identifier passed to the require() function to determine if our module is local, core, or third-party:
    Local Module: identifier starts with ./ ../ or /
    Node.js Core: identifier matches name
    Third-Party: identifier matches a module in the node modules folder (installed package)


    Encapsulation

    Puts the behavior and data together behind methods that hide the specific implementation so that code that uses it doesn’t need to worry about the details of it.

    Inheritance

    Implementation Inheritance : Means that data and methods defined on a parent class are available on objects created from classes that inherit from those parent classes.
    Prototypal Inheritance : Means that JS uses prototype objects to make its implementation inheritance actually work.
    Parent Class === Prototype === Super Class === Base Class
    Inheritance === Subtyping

    class MyClass {}

    // is the same as
    class MyClass extends Object {}

-   <span id="e595">**When you declare a class with no explicit parent class, JS will make it a child of Object.**</span>

<!-- -->

    class Charity {}

    class Business {
      toString() {
        return "Give us your money.";
      }
    }

    class Restaurant extends Business {
      toString() {
        return "Eat at Joe's!";
      }
    }

    class AutoRepairShop extends Business {}

    class Retail extends Business {
      toString() {
        return "Buy some stuff!";
      }
    }

    class ClothingStore extends Retail {}

    class PhoneStore extends Retail {
      toString() {
        return "Upgrade your perfectly good phone, now!";
      }
    }

    console.log(new PhoneStore().toString()); // 'Upgrade your perfectly good phone, now!'
    console.log(new ClothingStore().toString()); // 'Buy some stuff!';
    console.log(new Restaurant().toString()); // 'Eat at Joe\'s!'
    console.log(new AutoRepairShop().toString()); // 'Give us your money.'
    console.log(new Charity().toString()); // [object object]

#### The nuts and bolts of prototypal inheritance

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*FCIE6k4O9X8f9CbR" class="graf-image" /></figure>-   <span id="8fac">When JavaScript uses a property (or method) from a prototype that it found through prototypal inheritance, then the this property points to the original object on which the first call was made.</span>

<!-- -->

    class Parent {
      constructor() {
        this.name = "PARENT";
      }
      toString() {
        return `My name is ${this.name}`;
      }
    }

    class Child extends Parent {
      constructor() {
        super();
        this.name = "CHILD";
      }
    }

    const parent = new Parent();
    console.log(parent.toString()); // my name is Parent

    const child = new Child();
    console.log(child.toString()); // my name is Child

### Polymorphism

-   <span id="4da7">The ability to treat an object as if it were an instance of one of its parent classes.</span>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### The SOLID Principles Explained

SOLID is an anagram for:

-   <span id="cdba">`The Single-Responsibility Principle`</span>

### Iterating Through Objects

Objects store *unordered*  
`key`-`value` pairs. With Objects we can not rely on indices to access values.  
Meaning - we’ll have to iterate through objects in new ways to access the keys  
and values within.

This article will cover:

1.  <span id="164e">Iterate through Object `keys` and `values` using a `for...in` loop</span>
2.  <span id="a166">Use the `Object.keys` and the `Object.values` methods to iterate through an Object.</span>

### For In Loop

We can use special syntax to iterate through each `key` of an object (in  
arbitrary order). This is super useful for looping through **both** the keys and  
values of an object.

The syntax looks like this:

    // The current key is assigned to *variable* on each iteration.
    for (let variable in object) {
      statement;
    }

### ex.)

    let obj = { name: "Rose", cats: 2 };
    // The key we are accessing is assigned to the `currentKey`
    // *variable* on each iteration.
    for (let currentKey in obj) {
      console.log(currentKey);
    }
    // prints out:
    // name
    // cats

The example above prints all the keys found in `obj` to the screen.

On each iteration of the loop, the `key` we are currently accessing is assigned to the`currentKey` variable.

To access values in an object, we would throw some bracket notation  
into the mix:

    let obj = { name: "Rose", cats: 2 };
    for (let key in obj) {
      let value = obj[key];
      console.log(value);
    }
    // prints out:
    // Rose
    // 2

#### You can only use variable keys when using bracket notation (`obj[key]`)!

> Like all variables, you can name the current key variable whatever you like -  
> just be descriptive! Here is an example of using a descriptive name for a key  
> variable:

    let employees = {
      manager: "Angela",
      sales: "Gracie",
      service: "Paul"
    };
    for (let title in employees) {
      let person = employees[title];
      console.log(person);
    }
    // prints out:
    // Angela
    // Gracie
    // Paul

### What’s a method?

A **method** is essentially a function that *belongs to* an object.

That means that every *method is a function*, but **not** every function  
is a method.

-   <span id="cb33">`myFunc` is a function</span>
-   <span id="2c47">`myObject.myFunc` is a *method* of the object `myObject`</span>
-   <span id="14fe">`myObject["myFunc"]` is a *method* of the object `myObject`  
    A method is just a key-value pair where the **key is the function name and the  
    value is the function definition**! Let’s use what we learned earlier to teach  
    our dog some new tricks:</span>

<!-- -->

    let dog = {
      name: "Fido"
    };
    // defining a new key-value pair where the *function name* is the key
    // the function itself is the value!
    dog.bark = function() {
      console.log("bark bark!");
    };
    // this is the same thing as above just using Bracket Notation
    dog["speak"] = function(string) {
      console.log("WOOF " + string + " WOOF!!!");
    };
    dog.bark(); // prints `bark bark!`
    dog.speak("pizza"); // prints `WOOF pizza WOOF!!!`

Additionally, we can give objects methods when we initialize them:

    let dog2 = {
      name: "Rover",
      bark: function() {
        console.log("bork bork!");
      },
      speak: function(string) {
        console.log("BORK " + string + " BORK!!!");
      }
    };
    // Notice that in the object above, we still separate the key-value pairs with commas.
    // `bark` and `speak` are just keys with functions as values.
    dog2.bark(); // prints `bork bork!`
    dog2.speak("burrito"); // prints `BORK burrito BORK!!!`

To invoke, or call, a method we need to specify **which** object is calling that method. In the example above the `dog2` object had the `bark` method so to invoke `bark` we had to specify it was `dog2`’s method: `dog2.bark()`.

### Useful Object Methods

### Iterating through keys using `Object.keys`

The `Object.keys` method accepts an object as the argument and returns an array of the *keys* within that Object.

    > let dog = {name: "Fido", age: "2"}
    undefined
    > Object.keys(dog)
    ['name', 'age']
    > let cup = {color: "Red", contents: "coffee", weight: 5}
    undefined
    > Object.keys(cup)
    ['color', 'contents', 'weight']

The return value of `Object.keys` method is an array of keys - which is useful  
for iterating!

### Iterating through keys using `Object.values`

The `Object.values` method accepts an object as the argument and returns an  
array of the *values* within that Object.

    > let dog = {name: "Fido", age: "2"}
    undefined
    > Object.values(dog)
    ['Fido', '2']
    > let cup = {color: "Red", contents: "coffee", weight: 5}
    undefined
    > Object.keys(cup)
    ['Red', 'coffee', 5]

The return value of `Object.values` method is an array of values - which is  
useful for iterating!

Objects In JavaScript
=====================

The object is a data structure that stores other data, similar to how an array stores elements.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Objects In JavaScript

#### The `object` is a data structure that stores other data, similar to how an array stores elements.

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*p8Mho_ONNupan--Z.png" class="graf-image" /></figure>-   <span id="5c25">The object differs in that each `value` stores in an obj is associated with a `key`.</span>

### **The Object**

In other programming languages, objects are referred to as, “dictionaries”, “maps”, or “associative arrays”.

-   <span id="53af">Objects are indexed with `keys` instead of numbers.</span>
-   <span id="2cc0">Order is not guaranteed within an Object.</span>
-   <span id="ac45">Objects are defined by using curly braces `{}`</span>
-   <span id="2ca3">You can think of Objects as tables.</span>

#### **Setting Keys and Values**

    // here "color" is the key!
    >
    car["color"] = "Blue";
    "Blue"
    >
    car["seats"] = 2;
    2
    // accessing our object at the key of color
    &gt;
    car[&quot;color&quot;]

    "Blue"
    >
    car["seats"]
    2
    &gt;
    car {
        color: &quot;Blue&quot;,
        seats: 2
    }</code></pre>


    We assign values to an object by defining the name of the key in brackets and assigning it to a value.

    > car {
        color: "Blue",
        seats: 2
    }

    >
    "color" in car;
    true

        >
        "model" in car;
    false

    If we try to access a key that has not yet been assigned within an object we will output undefined.
    The preferred method for checking to see if an object exists at a key is to use the in operator.

    Using Variables as Keys
    > car {
        color: "Blue",
        seats: 2
    }
    >
    let newVariable = "color";
    undefined
    &gt;
    newVariable &quot;color&quot;

    &gt;
    car[newVariable]

    "Blue"

    >
    car {
    color: "Blue",
    seats: 2
    }
    >
    newVariable
    "weight"
    // assigning a key value pair using a variable!
    &gt;
    car[newVariable] = 1000;

    1000
    &gt;
    car {
        color: &quot;Blue&quot;,
        seats: 2,
        weight: 1000
    }</code></pre>


    It is useful to set a variable as a key because variables can be re-assigned new values — this way we can quickly access different data and also create new key/value pairs.

    Using Different Notations
    >
    let dog = {};
    undefined
    &gt;
    dog.bark = &quot;Bowowowo&quot;;

    "Bowowowowo"
    >
    dog.bark "Bowowowo"
    &gt;
    dog {
        bark: &quot;Bowowowowo&quot;
    }</code></pre>


    We can also use dot notation “.” to access key/value pairs in an object.
    One thing to note is that when using dot notation, we do not have to use string quotes as the key.

    Bracket Notation vs Dot Notation
    DotBracketEasier To ReadYou can use variables as keys! Easier To Write b/c do not need Quotations. Okay to use variables and Strings that start with numbers.Cannot access with VariablesKeys cannot contain numbers as their first character

    When accessing object keys: Bracket notation needs to refer to that key in quotations, dot notation doesn’t.
    When accessing object keys via a variable: Bracket notation can refer to that key w/o use of quotations, dot notation can’t do this at all.

    let myDog = {};
    myDog.name = "Fido";

    let myKey = "name";
    console.log(myDog); // prints `{name: "Fido"}`
    console.log(myDog[myKey]); // prints `Fido`

    console.log(myDog.myKey); // prints: undefined

    As illustrated above, the dot notation cannot access a variable key — since it takes a literal interpretation of the key.

    You can put an object together in a single statement.
    let myDog = {
        name: "Fido",
        type: "Doge",
        age: 2,
        favoriteToys: ["bone", "ball"],
    };
    Operator Precedence Revisited

    The concept of Operator Precedence also applies to objects.
    There are two types of associativity:
    Right Associativity : When code is evaluated right to left.

    a = b = 1;

    - Since **assignment of variables** takes lowest precendence, we end up evaluating b = 1 first before a = b.

    Left Associativity : When code is evaluated left to right.

    let id = "header";
        let element = document.getElementById(id).value;

    - We first resolve the document variable, then use dot notation to retrive the getElementById function, we eval it's arguments, access it's value, and then retrieve assignment \(the lowest precedence\).
    Iterating Through Objects
    Because objects store unordered key-value pairs, we do not rely on indices to access values; instead, we rely on our keys.
    A New Kind of For Loop
    for (let variable in object) {
        statement;
    let obj = {
        name: &quot;Rose&quot;,
        cats: 2
    };
    for (let currentKey in obj) {
        console.log(currentKey);
        console.log(obj[currentKey]);
    }

    // prints out:
    // name
    // cats
    // Rose
    // 2

    }

    We use a special syntax to iterate through each key of an object called a for-in loop.

    Methods vs Functions
    A Method is a function that belongs to an object. Every method is a function, but not every function is a method.
    myFunc is a
    function
    myObject.myFunc is a method of the object myObject
    myObject["myFunc"] is a method of the object myObject

    Methods are just a key-value pair where the key is the function name and the value is the function definition.

    let dog = {
        name: "Fido",
    };

    dog.bark = function() {
        console.log("bark bark!");
    };

    // this is the same thing as above just using Bracket Notation
    dog["speak"] = function(string) {
        console.log("WOOF " + string + " WOOF!!!");
    };

    dog.bark(); // prints `bark bark!`
    dog.speak("pizza"); // prints `WOOF pizza WOOF!!!`

    let dog2 = {
        name: "Rover",

        bark: function() {
            console.log("bork bork!");
        },

        speak: function(string) {
            console.log("BORK " + string + " BORK!!!");
        },
    };
    // Notice that in the object above, we still separate the key-value pairs with commas.
    // `bark` and `speak` are just keys with functions as values.

    dog2.bark(); // prints `bork bork!`
    dog2.speak("burrito"); // prints `BORK burrito BORK!!!`

    To invoke these methods we just need to specify which object is calling that method.

    myObject.methodName();
    Useful Object Methods

    Object.keys() : A method that allows us to iterate through keys, it accepts an obj as the argument and returns an array of the keys.
    Object.values() : Method that accepts an object as the argument and returns an array of the values.

    Iterating through an Object’s keys & values

    Object.entries : Method that accepts an object as the argument and returns an array of the [key, value] pairs within.

    > Object.entries(cat)[['name', 'Freyja'], ['color', 'orange']]
    References vs Primitives
    Primitives vs Objects
    So far we have learned about 6 different data types:

    Primitive: Boolean, Null, Undefined, Number, String.
    Reference: Object (Arrays are a type of object)
    Remember that primitive types are immutable!

    Immutability

    When we reassign primitives we simply have our variable point elsewhere in memory.
    In a nutshell, immutability cannot change values in memory, but only reassign where our variables are pointing to.

    Mutability

    If we change either cat1 or cat2, our computer memory will change because they are both pointing at the same memory location.

    Rest and Spread
    Using the Spread Operator and Rest Parameter Syntax Accepting Arguments

    Just keep in mind that the function will still run even if it is not passed any arguments.
    Parameters will take just as many arguments as they need even if more than enough is offered.
    We will encounter an error if there are not enough parameters ( > 0).

    Utilizing Rest Parameters

    Rest Parameter Syntax : Allows us to capture all of a function’s incoming arguments into an array.
    Only the last parameter can be a rest parameter.

    Utilizing Spread Syntax

    Spread Operator: This allows us to break down a data type into the elements that make it up.
    Takes a data type (i.e. array, obj) and spreads the values of that type where elements are expected.
    Takes iterable data and spreads the elements of that type where arguments are expected.

    let numArray = [1, 2, 3];

    // here we are taking `numArray` and *spreading* it into a new array where
    // comma separated elements are expected to be
    let moreNums = [...numArray, 4, 5, 6];

    >
    moreNums
    // => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
    With Objects
    let colors = {
        red: "scarlet",
        blue: "aquamarine"
    };
    let newColors = {
        ...colors
    };
    >
    newColors
    // { red: "scarlet", blue: "aquamarine" };
    let colors = {
    red: "scarlet",
    blue: "aquamarine"
    };
    let colors2 = {
    green: "forest",
    yellow: "sunflower"
    };
    let moreColors = {
    ...colors,
    ...colors2
    };
    >
    moreColors
    // {red: "scarlet", blue: "aquamarine", green: "forest", yellow: "sunflo

    Codepen with examples for you to practice with below!



    The Object Type
    The object is a data structure that stores other data, similar to how an array stores elements.
    Javascript simple types:

    numbers (has object-like methods but they are immutable)
    strings (has object-like methods but they are immutable)
    booleans (has object-like methods but they are immutable)
    null
    undefined

    All other values are objects including arrays and functions.
    Objects are class free, can contain other objects and can inherit properties from their prototypes (which can reduce object initialisation time and memory consumption).
    In other programming languages, objects are referred to as, “dictionaries”, “maps”, or “associative arrays”.

    Objects are indexed with keys instead of numbers.
    Order is not guaranteed within an Object.
    Objects are defined by using curly braces {}
    You can think of Objects as tables.


    Fun Fact: Objects are affectionately known as POJO’s (Plain Old Javascript Objects)

    Setting Keys and Values

    If we try to access a key that has not yet been assigned within an object we will output undefined.
    The preferred method for checking to see if an object exists at a key is to use the operator.

    Using the Spread Operator and Rest Parameter Syntax
    Accepting Arguments

    Just keep in mind that function will still run even if it is not passed any arguments.
    Parameters will take just as many arguments they need even if more than enough are offered.
    We will encounter an error if there are not enough parameters ( > 0).

    Utilizing Rest Parameters

    Rest Parameter Syntax : Allows us to capture all of a function’s incoming arguments into an array.
    Only the last parameter can be a rest parameter.

    Utilizing Spread Syntax

    Takes a data type (i.e. array, obj) and spreads the values of that type where elements are expected.
    Takes iterable data and spreads the elements of that type where arguments are expected.

    Destructuring
    Swapping Variables using destructuring
    Destructuring objects into variables
    Destructuring and the Rest Pattern
    Destructuring Parameters
    We can also destructure incoming parameters of a function.
     This is very useful when we’re passing objects around to different functions.

    Object Literals

    An object literal is zero or more comma-separated name/value pairs surrounded by curly braces {}

    let empty_object = {};

    let today = {
        day: "Wednesday",
        month: "April",
        year: 2014,

    weather: { //objects can contain nested objects like this one
            morning: "sunny",
            afternoon: "cloudy"
        }
    }
    Retrieval

    Can be done with either dot notation today.weather.morning or with square brackets today['month']
    Or operand (||) can be used to fill in default values for nonexistent data to prevent and undefined error: var weath = today.weather.evening || "unknown"

    Update

    Assigning a property value to an object overwrites any existing property values with that property name

    Reference

    Objects refer to each other, they don’t hold duplicate copies of data

    Prototype

    Every object has a prototype object from which it inherits properties
    Object.prototype comes standard with Javascript and is almost like a ‘root parent’





    The Object.create method is now available in ES5 (but the method is in the book if required for older versions)
    If an object does not have a property you ask it for, it will keep looking up the prototype chain until it finds it
    If the property does note exist anywhere in the chain, it will return undefined
    A new property is immediately visible to all of the objects below it in the chain once created

    More details in Chapter 6
    Reflection

    Determining what properties an object has
    Using typeof includes all properties in the prototype chain including functions
    To avoid inherited properties, use hasOwnProperty(type); which returns true if that property exists only in that object itself (not the chain)

    today.hasOwnProperty(‘number’) //will return true today.hasOwnProperty(‘constructor’) //will return false
    Enumeration

    Best way to enumerate all the properties you want is a for loop:

    let i;
    let properties = [ ‘day’, ‘month’, ‘year’ ]; 
    for (i = 0; i < properties.length; i++) { 
        document.writeIn(properties[i] + ‘:’ + today[properties[i]]);
     }

    This ensures you get the properties you want (i.e. not up the prototype chain) and in the order you want, as opposed to a for in loop which achieves neither of these

    Delete

    Removes property from object, but also reveals property from further up the prototype chain if it exists
    Format: delete today.month

    Global Abatement

    One way to mitigate the risks of global variables is to create a single global variable which then contains your whole application

    let MYAPP = {}

    MYAPP.today = {
        day: "Wednesday",
        month: "April",
        year: 2014,

    weather: { //objects can contain nested objects like this one
            morning: "sunny",
            afternoon: "cloudy"
        }
    }
    //Making sure all other variables (like today) are contained within this one global variable (MYAPP) means none of them have global scope and therefore the risk of naming conflicts, etc in your application is reduced

    PostgreSQL In 43 Commands Or Less
    In database jargon, PostgreSQL uses a client/server model. A PostgreSQL session consists of the following cooperating processes (programs):
    ALLOFMYOTHERARTICLES bryanguner.medium.com




    A server process, which manages the database files, accepts connections to the database from client applications, and performs database actions on behalf of the clients. The database server program is called postgres.
    The user’s client (frontend) application that wants to perform database operations. Client applications can be very diverse in nature: a client could be a text-oriented tool, a graphical application, a web server that accesses the database to display web pages, or a specialized database maintenance tool. Some client applications are supplied with the PostgreSQL distribution; most are developed by users.

    As is typical of client/server applications, the client and the server can be on different hosts. In that case they communicate over a TCP/IP network connection. You should keep this in mind, because the files that can be accessed on a client machine might not be accessible (or might only be accessible using a different file name) on the database server machine.
    The PostgreSQL server can handle multiple concurrent connections from clients. To achieve this it starts (“forks”) a new process for each connection. From that point on, the client and the new server process communicate without intervention by the original postgres process. Thus, the master server process is always running, waiting for client connections, whereas client and associated server processes come and go. (All of this is of course invisible to the user. We only mention it here for completeness.)
    What is SQL?
    SQL is short for Structured Query Language. Originally, it used to be called SEQUEL (Structured English Query Language) and was used for storing and manipulating data in databases. Today SQL is used to perform all types of data operations in relational database management systems (RDBMS).
    SQL is a powerful language where we can perform a wide range of operations:

    execute queries
    fetch data
    insert, update, and delete records in a database (DML operations)
    create new objects in a database (DDL operations)
    set permissions on tables, procedures, functions, and views
    and much, much more…

    Data is absolutely everywhere. When you visited this web page, you generated data. When you took a note of your to-dos for the day in your reminders, you generated data.
    All of this data needs to go somewhere! That’s where databases come in. Databases store information in a structured way so that it is accessible by computer programs. Programmers use a tool called Structured Query Language (SQL) to access and manipulate databases.
    In this guide, we’re going to provide a brief overview of SQL to help you level up your skills! Without further ado, let’s get started!
    More On SQL?
    SQL was invented in the early 1970s by the IBM researchers Donald Chamberlin and Raymond Boyce. The technology may be old but it’s still a crucial part of interacting with databases.
    SQL is used to retrieve data from databases, insert records into a database, update a database, and to control the permissions in a database.
    SQL is used with Relational Database Management Systems, or RDBMS. These are databases which are broken up into tables. Each table consists of a list of columns and rows. Tables can be linked together by creating primary and foreign keys between the tables.
    Data scientists, database administrators, data analysts, business analysts and back-end web developers are several of the many types of technologists who use databases in their work.
    Here’s a guide on how to get setup with PSQL:
    PostgreSQL Setup For Windows & WSL/Ubuntu If you follow this guide to a tee… you will install PostgreSQL itself on your Windows installation. Then, you will…bryanguner.medium.com
    Here’s a Cheatsheet I made:
    Postgresql Cheat Sheet PostgreSQL commandsmedium.com

    Inserting Data into a Database
    Create a Table
    The CREATE TABLE statement creates a new table in a database. You can use this command to specify what columns should appear in a database and the types of those columns.
    Insert a Record
    The INSERT INTO statement inserts a new row into a database. Depending on the structure of a table, this statement can be used to insert some or all the values into a record.
    Selecting Data from a Database
    Selecting Data
    The SELECT statement selects data from one or more tables. It can be used to retrieve all the rows in a table or only rows that meet a set of conditions. You can filter out what columns will be returned by the SELECT statement.
    Where Statement
    The WHERE statement allows you to select a record based on a condition.
    For instance, you could select all of the names in an Employees table that start with the letter “B”. You could select all the people in an Employees table who have worked for a business for at least four years.
    Ordering Data
    The ORDER BY clause sorts data by a particular column name. It can be used to sort data in either ascending or descending order.
    You could sort a list of employees in ascending order based on the day they were hired. You could sort a list of coffee products by their prices in descending order.
    Limiting Data
    SQL databases can contain a lot of records. The LIMIT clause allows you to limit how many rows are returned by a query. For instance, you could return only the first five responses from a particular query.
    Query Values Using Between
    The BETWEEN operator allows you to select records where a column value is within a particular range. For instance, you could use BETWEEN to retrieve a list of employees who work at a business and who earn between $20,000 and $30,000. You could use BETWEEN to retrieve a list of all the coffees at a cafe which cost between $2.00 and $2.50.
    Updating a Database
    Updating a database allows you to modify the information you have already stored, and you can do so by doing the following:
    Updating Records
    The UPDATE statement amends the contents of a table. This statement will change all the values in a database that meet a particular condition or set of conditions. You can use a WHERE statement to select which values should be updated.
    Deleting Records
    The DELETE statement removes one or more rows from a table. By default, this command deletes all the records in a table. The DELETE statement is usually used with a WHERE statement so that only particular records are deleted.
    The SQL ALTER TABLE statement adds, changes, or removes a column in a table. This statement lets you modify a table after it has been created, even if the table stores records.
    You may decide that you need to make a change to an SQL table. For instance, you may want to rename a column or add a new column to the table. These changes are all possible with the SQL ALTER TABLE command.












    SQL ALTER TABLE
    The ALTER TABLE command allows you to change an existing table by:

    Adding a column.
    Adding a constraint.
    Removing a column.
    Changing a data type.
    Renaming a column.

    There is no SQL ADD COLUMN statement. To add a column to an SQL table, you must use the ALTER TABLE ADD syntax. ALTER TABLE lets you add, delete, or modify columns in a table.
    After you have created a table in SQL, you may realize that you forgot to add in a specific column that you need. For example, say you may have created a database to store a list of suppliers. Maybe you forgot to include a field to store the category of goods the supplier offers.
    In these situations, you can use the SQL ALTER TABLE statement to amend an existing table. This statement allows you to add a column, change a column, or delete a column.
    Below is an SQL command that will create an employee database that stores three columns. This database stores name of an employee, their title, and the branch for which they work.
    CREATE TABLE employees (
       name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
        title VARCHAR(75) NOT NULL,
       branch VARCHAR(25) NOT NULL
    );
    But what if we’ve forgotten to add a column? Say we need to add a column that states whether an employee is on probation. That’s where the ALTER TABLE statement comes in.
    SQL Add Column
    To perform an SQL add column operation, use the ALTER TABLE ADD command. This command alters a table and adds in a column with the specified data type. Using this command, you can add a column to a table after you have created the table.
    SQL UNION:
    When you’re querying a database, you may want to combine the result of two or more SELECT statements. For example, you may want to get a list of the cities in which your customers are based, and the cities in which your business has branches. You could run two queries to achieve this goal, but you may want to have a result in one query.
    That’s where the SQL UNION operator comes in. The UNION clause can be used to combine the results of two or more SELECT queries into a single result set.
    In this tutorial, we are going to break down the basics of the SQL UNION operator and discuss where you may want to use this command when you’re working with a database.
    Query Refresher
    Programmers use queries to retrieve information from a database. Queries almost always begin with the SQL SELECT statement and are used to retrieve data based on a set of criteria. Queries usually include the FROM operator, which states which table will be queried, among other operators that can filter the resulting data.
    Here is the general syntax for an SQL query:
    SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE your_condititions_are_met;
    Here’s an example of an SQL query that returns a list of all employee names:
    SELECT name FROM employees;
    The output from our query is as follows:
    nameLuke
    Mike
    Hannah
    Geoff
    Alexis
    Emma
    Jonah
    (7 rows)
    If you want to retrieve information from multiple columns, you can so do by separating the column names with a comma. If you want to get data from every column, you can use an asterisk (*) instead, which represents every column in a table.
    » MORE: SQL Outer Join
    SQL Union
    The SQL UNION operator can be used to combine the results of two or more queries into a single response that results in one table.
    In order to use the UNION operator, two conditions must be met. Firstly, the data types of the new columns should be compatible—if a salary is an integer in one table and a float in the other, the union would not work. Secondly, the number and order of the columns must be the same in your queries.
    Here’s the syntax for an SQL UNION query:
    SELECT column_name FROM table1_name
    UNION SELECT column_name FROM table2_name;
    Let’s use an example to illustrate how the SQL UNION operator works. Let’s say that we are a business that needs to send an announcement to all of our customers. We also want all employees to be sent this announcement so they are aware of what is going on.
    SQL Aggregate Functions:
    SQL aggregate functions collate information about what is in a database. For instance, you can use SUM to find the total of all the values in a column. Aggregate functions save you time when you need to find out information that involves aggregating records.,
    Here is a list of the aggregate functions in SQL you can use:

    COUNT
    SUM
    AVG
    MIN
    MAX

    Let’s walk through each of these individually. We’re going to be referring to a database of employees throughout this tutorial.
    Aggregate functions are used at the beginning of the SQL SELECT statement.
    If you query both a column and an aggregate function in the same SELECT statement, you must use an SQL GROUP BY clause. This clause tells SQL how to represent the data in your query.
    SQL Subquery
    An SQL subquery is a query inside another query. It is used in the WHERE or HAVING clause of an SQL statement. Subqueries let you specify the results of one query as an argument in another query.
    When you’re writing an SQL query, you may want to specify a parameter based on the result of another query. For example, say you have a list of customers. You may want to get a list of customers who have placed orders worth a value over a certain amount. Order and customer information is stored within a different table.
    That’s where the SQL subquery operation comes in. Subqueries, also known as nested queries, are SELECT queries within the WHERE clause of another SQL query. The main SQL query then uses the result of the subquery.

    SQL query examples
    Now let’s explore some examples of common and useful PostgreSQL queries that can be used in various situations.
    From PSQL DOCS:
    1. CREATE TABLE query in PostgreSQL
    CREATE TABLE is a keyword that will create a new, initially empty table in the database. The table will be owned by the user who has issued this command.
    postgres=# create table dummy_table(name varchar(20),address text,age int);
          CREATE TABLE
    2. INSERT query in PostgreSQL
    The INSERT command is used to insert data into a table:
    postgres=# insert into dummy_table values('XYZ','location-A',25);
            INSERT 0 1
            postgres=# insert into dummy_table values('ABC','location-B',35);
            INSERT 0 1
            postgres=# insert into dummy_table values('DEF','location-C',40);
            INSERT 0 1
            postgres=# insert into dummy_table values('PQR','location-D',54);
            INSERT 0 1
    3. SELECT query without WHERE condition in PostgreSQL
    The SELECT command (when used without the optional WHERE condition) is used to fetch all data from a database table:
    postgres=# select * from dummy_table;
            name |  address   | age 
            ---------+--------------+ -----
            XYZ   | location-A |  25
            ABC   | location-B |  35
            DEF   | location-C |  40
            PQR   | location-D |  54
            (4 rows)
    4. UPDATE query in PostgreSQL
    UPDATE is used to make updates to the data or row(s) of a database table. In the example below we use UPDATE to change the age of a person whose name is ‘PQR’:
    postgres=# update dummy_table set age=50 where name='PQR';
            UPDATE 1
            postgres=# select * from dummy_table;
            name |  address   | age 
            --------+--------------+-------
            XYZ  | location-A |  25
            ABC  | location-B |  35
            DEF  | location-C |  40
            PQR  | location-D |  50
            (4 rows)
    Next, we’ll use the UPDATE command to change the name and age of a person whose address is ‘location-D’:
    postgres=# update dummy_table set name='GHI',age=54 where address='location-D';
    UPDATE 1
    postgres=# select * from dummy_table;
     name |  address   | age 
    ------+------------+-----
     XYZ  | location-A |  25
     ABC  | location-B |  35
     DEF  | location-C |  40
     GHI  | location-D |  54
    (4 rows)
    postgres=#
    If we want to modify all the values in the address and age columns in dummy_table, then we do not need to use the WHERE clause. The UPDATE query would look like this:
    postgres=# update dummy_table set age=54,address='location-X';
    UPDATE 4
    postgres=# select * from dummy_table ;
    name |  address   | age
    ------+------------+--------
    XYZ  | location-X |  54
    ABC  | location-X |  54
    DEF  | location-X |  54
    GHI  | location-X |  54
    (4 rows)
    postgres=#
    A RETURNING clause returns the updated rows. This is optional in UPDATE:
    postgres=# update dummy_table set age=30 where name='XYZ' returning age as age_no;
     age_no 
    ---------
          30
    (1 row)
    UPDATE 1
    It is always recommended to perform such operations under transaction blocks (i.e., BEGIN…COMMIT/ROLLBACK;), so we have the option to roll back the operation.
    5. DELETE query in PostgreSQL
    The DELETE command is used to delete row(s). It can be used with or without the optional WHERE condition, but take note: if the WHERE condition is missing, the command will delete all rows, leaving you with an empty table.
    In this example, we are deleting one row whose age column has the value 65:
    postgres=# delete from dummy_table where age=65;
    DELETE 1
    postgres=#
    6. Comparison Operators in PostgreSQL queries
    In PostgreSQL, with the help of comparison operators we can find results where the value in a column is not equal to the specified condition or value.
    Less than or equal to query:
    postgres=# select * from dummy_table where age <=50;
     name |  address   | age 
    ------+------------+-----
     XYZ  | location-A |  25
     ABC  | location-B |  35
     DEF  | location-C |  40
     PQR  | location-D |  50
    (4 rows)
    Greater than or equal to query:
    postgres=# select * from dummy_table where age>=50;
     name |  address   | age 
    ------+------------+-----
     PQR  | location-D |  50
    (1 row)
    Not equal to query:
    postgres=# select * from dummy_table where age<>50;
     name |  address   | age 
    ------+------------+-----
     XYZ  | location-A |  25
     ABC  | location-B |  35
     DEF  | location-C |  40
    (3 rows)
    Equal to query:
    postgres=# select * from dummy_table where age=50;
     name |  address   | age 
    ------+------------+-----
     PQR  | location-D |  50
    (1 row)
    7. SELECT DISTINCT query in PostgreSQL
    The SELECT DISTINCT statement is used to return only distinct values from the table. It removes any duplicate values.
    SELECT query without DISTINCT clause
    postgres=# select age from dummy_table order by 1;
     age 
    -----
       1
       1
       2
       2
       3
    (5 rows)
    SELECT query with DISTINCT clause
    postgres=# select distinct age from dummy_table order by 1;
     age 
    -----
       1
       2
       3
    (3 rows)
    8. TRUNCATE query in PostgreSQL
    The TRUNCATE command is used to empty a table:
    postgres=# truncate table dummy_table;
    TRUNCATE TABLE
    9. DROP TABLE query in PostgreSQL
    This DROP TABLE command is used to drop a table from the database:
    postgresql=# drop table if exists dummy;
    NOTICE:  table "dummy" does not exist, skipping
    DROP TABLE
    This command has removed the full table, including any associated data, indexes, rules, triggers, and constraints for that table.
    10. CREATE VIEW query in PostgreSQL
    The CREATE VIEW command is used to generate views. Views are pseudo-tables, which are used to present a full table, subset, or select columns from the underlying table:
    postgres=# create or replace view vi as select * from dummy_table where age is NULL;
    CREATE VIEW
    11. Create a table in Postgresql using the SELECT statement
    Using the syntax in the example below, we can create a table using a SELECT statement:
    postgres=# select 'My name  is X' as col1 , 10 as col2, 'Address is -XYZ location' as col3  into new_table;
    SELECT 1
    postgres=# select * from new_table ;
         col1      | col2 |           col3           
    ---------------+------+--------------------------
     My name  is X |   10 | Address is -XYZ location
    (1 row)
    12. Query timeout in PostgreSQL
    We can command a query to timeout after a certain period with the help of GUC parameters (short for grand unified configuration) like statement_timeout, which aborts any statement that takes more than the specified number of milliseconds:
    postgresql=# set statement_timeout=10;
    SET
    postgresql=# select pg_sleep(20);
    ERROR:  canceling statement due to statement timeout
    13. Using CREATE SEQUENCE with the INSERT query in PostgreSQL
    The CREATE SEQUENCE command is a sequential number generator. Once the sequence is created, we can use the sequence’s nextval and currval functions to insert values into a table:
    postgres=# create sequence seq;
    CREATE SEQUENCE
    postgres=# create table tab(n int);
    CREATE TABLE
    postgres=# insert into tab values (nextval('seq'));
    INSERT 0 1
    postgres=# insert into tab values (currval('seq'));
    INSERT 0 1
    postgres=# insert into tab values (nextval('seq'));
    INSERT 0 1
    postgres=# select * from tab;
     n 
    ---
     1
     1
     2
    (3 rows)
    14. Importing BLOB data types into PostgreSQL
    PostgreSQL doesn’t directly support BLOBs (binary large objects), but we can work with them using the following methods:
    Let’s assume you have an image (in png format) downloaded in the /home/edb/ folder:
    [edb@localhost]$ ls /home/edb/mypic.png 
    /home/edb/mypic.png
    We want to store this image in the PostgreSQL database.
    Go to the bin folder of your PostgreSQL installation and connect to the psql terminal:
    postgres=# Create table testing(n int,n1 oid);
    CREATE TABLE
    postgres=# insert into testing values (1,lo_import('/home/edb/mypic.png'));
    INSERT 0 1
    The lo_import() function loads the named file into pg_largeobject and returns an OID (object identifier) value that will refer to the large object. Selecting the testing table will show just the OID and not the bits that have made up this photo.
    15. ILIKE query in PostgreSQL
    The ILIKE operator is a matching function similar to the LIKE operator, but with the advantage that it matches valus case-insensitively.
    postgres=# select * from ted;
      n  
    -----
     TAR
     TaR
     Tar
     tar
    (4 rows)
    Using ILIKE in a WHERE condition
    postgres=# select * from ted where n ilike 'TAR%';
      n  
    -----
     TAR
     TaR
     Tar
     tar
    (4 rows)
    16. Hierarchical queries in PostgreSQL
    Hierarchical queries are ones where the results have a structured or parent-child relationship and are displayed in a tree structure. To see how hierarchical queries work, create a dummy table:
    create table test_table(  
      emp_no                int,  
      ename                 char(5),  
      job                       char(9),  
      manager_no        int
    );
    Insert data into ‘test_table’:
    insert into test_table values(10,'A1','CEO',null);
    insert into test_table values(11, 'B1', 'VP', 10);
    insert into test_table values(12, 'B2', 'VP', 10);
    insert into test_table values(13, 'B3', 'VP', 10);
    insert into test_table values(14, 'C1', 'DIRECTOR', 13);
    insert into test_table values(15, ‘C2’, ‘DIRECTOR’, 13);
    insert into test_table values(16, 'D1', 'MANAGER', 15);
    insert into test_table values(17 ,'E1', 'ENGINEER', 11);
    insert into test_table values(18, 'E2', 'ENGINEER', 11);
    We can perform hierarchical queries on this table using the methods below.
    17. Length function in PostgreSQL
    The length function returns the number of characters or number of bytes in a specified string variable.
    Basic SELECT query
    postgres=# select name,age from dummy_table;
     name | age 
    ------+-----
     XYZ  |  25
     ABC  |  35
     DEF  |  40
     PQR  |  54
     PQR  |    
    (5 rows)
    Query with length function for column name and age
    postgres=# select length(name),length(age) from dummy_table;
     length | length 
    --------+--------
          3 |      2
          3 |      2
          3 |      2
          3 |      2
          3 |       
    (5 rows)
    18. When a query has no destination for result data in PostgreSQL
    Say that while selecting a given function, we receive the error message below:
    postgresql=# create or replace function f(n int) 
    returns int 
    as 
    $$ 
    begin 
    select now();
    return 1;
     end; 
    $$ language 'plpgsql';
    CREATE FUNCTION
    postgres=# select f(9);
    ERROR:  query has no destination for result data
    HINT:  If you want to discard the results of a SELECT, use PERFORM instead.
    To avoid such errors, we can either use PERFORM or declare a variable and use it in a SELECT INTO statement:
    Using PERFORM
    postgres=# create or replace function f(n int) 
    returns int 
    as 
    $$ 
    begin 
    perform
    now(); 
     return 1; 
     end; 
    $$ language 'plpgsql';
    CREATE FUNCTION
    postgresql=# select f(9);
     f 
    ---
     1
    (1 row)
    Declaring a variable and using it in a SELECT INTO statement
    postgres=# create or replace function f(n int) 
    returns int 
    as 
    $$ 
    declare 
    a date;
    begin 
    select now() into a;
    raise notice ‘%s’,a; 
    return 1; 
    end; 
    $$ language 'plpgsql';
    CREATE FUNCTION
    postgresql=# select f(9);
    NOTICE: 24-SEP-20 13:15:46.23388s
    f
    ---
    1
    (1 row)
    19. Exporting query result to a text file in PostgreSQL
    With the help of the COPY command, we can export data from a table to an outside text file as well as import data from a text file into a table.
    Exporting data from a table to a text file
    postgres=#  copy dummy_table to '/tmp/abc.txt';
    COPY 5
    postgres=# ! cat /tmp/abc.txt
    XYZ   location-A  25
    ABC   location-B  35
    DEF   location-C  40
    PQR   location-D  50
    CXC   1   50
    Importing data from a text file into a table
    postgres=# copy dummy_table from '/tmp/abc.txt';
    COPY 5

    With the help of common table expressions (CTE):

    postgres=#WITH RECURSIVE cte AS (                                                                                                                                                          SELECT emp_no, ename, manager_no, 1 AS level                                                                                                                                             FROM   test_table                                                                                                                                                                      where manager_no is null                                                                                                                                                            UNION  ALL                                                                                                                                                                               SELECT e.emp_no, e.ename, e.manager_no, c.level + 1                                                                                                                                      FROM   cte c                                                                                                                                                                             JOIN   test_table e ON e.manager_no = c.emp_no                                                                                  )                                                                                                                                                                                     SELECT *                                                                                                                                                                                 FROM   cte;  emp_no | ename | manager_no | level  -----------+----------+------------------+-------      10    | A1        |                        |     1      11    | B1        |          10          |     2      12    | B2        |          10          |     2      13    | B3        |          10          |     2      14    | C1        |         13           |     3      17    | E1        |          11          |      3      18    | E2        |          11           |     3      15    | C2        |          13           |     3      16    | D1        |          15           |     4 (9 rows)  postgres=#

    Using the tablefunc extension:


    The tablefunc extension is a contrib module that resides in the contrib/ folder in PostgreSQL sources.
    First, create the tablefunc extension:


    postgres=# CREATE EXTENSION tablefunc; CREATE EXTENSION postgres=#


    Then, use tablefunc’s connectby function to display results hierarchically:

    postgres=# SELECT * FROM connectby('dummy_table', 'emp_no', 'manager_no', '10', 0, '->') AS t(emp_no int, manager_no int, level int, ord text) order by emp_no;   emp_no | manager_no | level |      ord         --------+------------+-------+----------------       10 |                       |      0        | 10       11 |              10     |      1        | 10->11       12 |              10     |      1        | 10->12       13 |              10     |      1        | 10->13       14 |              13     |      2        | 10->13->14       15 |              13     |      2        | 10->13->15       16 |              15     |      3        | 10->13->15->16       17 |              11     |      2        | 10->11->17       18 |              11     |      2        | 10->11->18  (9 rows)   postgres=#
    20. Listing databases query in PostgreSQL
    The following query can be used to show all the databases created:
    postgres=# select oid,datname from pg_database;
      oid     |  datname  
    -----------+-----------
     13743 | postgres
         1     | template1
     13742 | template0
    (3 rows)
    We can also list out all the database names using the \l command at the psql prompt.
    21. Checking query execution time in PostgreSQL
    We can check the time needed for a query to execute by enabling \timing at the psql prompt:
    postgres=# \timing
    Timing is on.
    The SELECT query will now show the execution time:
    postgres=# select * from dummy_table;
     name |  address   | age 
    ------+------------+--------
     XYZ  | location-A | 25
     ABC  | location-B | 35
     DEF  | location-C | 40
     PQR  | location-D | 50
     CXC  | 1               | 50
    (5 rows)
    Time: 0.440 ms
    postgres=#
    22. Dynamic SQL query in PostgreSQL
    Dynamic SQL is used to reduce repetitive tasks when it comes to querying.
    Dynamic SQL queries are not cached in memory.
    postgres=# do
    postgres-# $$
    postgres$# begin
    postgres$# execute 'select * from dummy_table';
    postgres$# end;
    postgres$# $$;
    DO
    23. COUNT query in PostgreSQL
    The COUNT query returns the number of rows in a table. If we use (*) this will include null values; otherwise null values will be excluded.
    postgres=# select count(*) from dummy_table;
     count 
    -------
         5
    (1 row)
    postgres=# select count(avg) from dummy_table;
    count
     4

    (1 row)
    24. LIMIT and OFFSET query in PostgreSQL
    The LIMIT clause is used to limit the data amount returned by the SELECT statement. The query below will display only 1 row:
    postgres=# select * from dummy_table  limit 1;
     name |  address   | age 
    ------+------------+-----
     XYZ  | location-A |  25
    (1 row)
    OFFSET is used when we want to skip a particular number of rows:
    postgres=# select * from dummy_table  offset 4;
     name | address | age 
    ------+---------+-----
     cxc  | 1       |  50
    (1 row)
    25. IF … ELSE expression in PostgreSQL
    We can use conditional statements like IF … ELSE in an anonymous block. The example below checks if the values of variables abc and xyz are matching and prints the result— i.e., 150:
    postgres=# Do 
                 $$
                 Declare
                  abc int;
                  xyz int;
                  begin
                  abc:=100;
                  xyz:=abc;
                  if abc=xyz then 
                   xyz=150;  
                  raise notice '%',xyz;
                 else
                 end if;               
                 end;
                   $$
    ;
    NOTICE:  150
    DO
    26. UPDATE with JOIN query in PostgreSQL
    We can use UPDATE with a JOIN and WHERE clause when we want to update the values from one table (table X) based on values from another table (table Y):
    postgres=# create table X(n int, n1 char(10));
    CREATE TABLE
    postgres=# insert into X values (1,'abc');
    INSERT 0 1
    postgres=# insert into X values (2,'xyz');
    INSERT 0 1
    postgres=# insert into X values (3,'pqr');
    INSERT 0 1
    postgres=# create table Y(n int, n1 char(10));
    CREATE TABLE
    postgres=# insert into Y values (1,'');
    INSERT 0 1
    postgres=# insert into Y values (2,'');
    INSERT 0 1
    postgres=# insert into Y values (5,'axyz');
    INSERT 0 1
    postgres=# update Y set n1=X.n1 from X  where X.n=Y.n;
    UPDATE 2
    postgres=# select * from Y;
    n |     n1
    ---+------------
    5 | axyz
    1 | abc
    2 | xyz
    (3 rows)
    postgres=#
    27. INNER JOIN query in PostgreSQL
    The INNER JOIN command will find rows from two (or more) tables where the specified columns data in the tables match:
    postgres=# select *  from x inner join  y on  x.n1 = y.n1;
     n |     n1     | n |     n1     
    ---+------------+---+------------
     1 | abc        | 1 | abc       
     2 | xyz        | 2 | xyz       
    (2 rows)
    postgres=#
    28. CASE expression in PostgreSQL
    The CASE expression is a generic conditional expression, similar to the IF … ELSE statement.
    postgres=# SELECT age,
           CASE age WHEN 25 THEN 'one'
                  WHEN 50 THEN 'two'
                  ELSE 'other'
           END
        FROM  dummy_table;
     age | case  
    -----+-------
      25 | one
      35 | other
      40 | other
      50 | two
      50 | two
    (5 rows)
    29. PostgreSQL recursive query
    Recursive queries are used to deal with hierarchical queries or tree-structured data. The structure of a WITH RECURSIVE query is always: a) Non-recursive term
     b) UNION (or UNION ALL), then a recursive term
    where the recursive term includes a reference to the query’s output.
    CREATE TABLE emp_test (
      id int,
      ename varchar(255),
      emanager int
    );
    INSERT INTO emp_test VALUES (1, 'abc', null);
    INSERT INTO emp_test VALUES (2, 'xyz', 1);
    INSERT INTO emp_test VALUES (3, 'def', 2);
    INSERT INTO emp_test VALUES (4, 'cde', 1);
    INSERT INTO emp_test VALUES (5, 'qrs', 2);
    INSERT INTO emp_test VALUES (9, 'iop', 3);
    INSERT INTO emp_test VALUES (10, 'klm', 4);
    The recursive query below will give all the reports in a certain order:
    postgres=#WITH RECURSIVE emp_testnew  AS (
      SELECT id, ename, emanager
      FROM emp_test
      WHERE id = 2
      UNION ALL
      SELECT e.id, e.ename, e.emanager
      FROM emp_test e
      INNER JOIN emp_testnew e1 ON e1.id = e.emanager
    )
    SELECT *
    FROM emp_testnew;
    id | ename | emanager
    ----+-------+----------
    2 | xyz   |        1
    3 | def   |        2
    5 | qrs   |        2
    9 | iop   |        3
    (4 rows)
    postgres=#
    30. PostgreSQL log queries
    Using the pg_stat_statements module, we can track execution statistics for all SQL statements. To do this, we need to create an extension and add in shared_preload_libraries inside the postgresql.conf file:
    postgres=# create extension pg_stat_statements;
    CREATE EXTENSION
    postgres=# show shared_preload_libraries ;
    shared_preload_libraries
    $libdir/pg_stat_statements
    (1 row)
    postgres=# select query from pg_stat_statements where query like 'create table%';
    -[ RECORD 1 ]-------------------
    query | create table test(n int)
    We can also configure PostgreSQL to generate log output by enabling these parameters in the postgresql.conf file:
    logging_collector = on
    log_directory = 'log'
    log_filename = ‘postgresql-%Y-%m-%d_%H%M%S.log'
    log_destination = ‘stderr’
    Log file will be created under the pg_log directory which resides under the data folder. 
    [centos@tushar-ldap-docker bin]lsdata/logpostgresql−2020−09−17150932.logpostgresql−2020−09−19000000.log[centos@tushar−ldap−dockerbin]ls  data/log

    Queries will be recorded in these files.
    31. Using a variable in a PostgreSQL query
    We can declare a variable in PostgreSQL at the psql prompt:
    postgres=# \set cond 50
    Using a variable in a WHERE condition
    postgres=# select * from dummy_table where age=:cond;
     name |  address   | age 
    ------+------------+-----
     PQR  | location-D |  50
    (1 row)
    OR
    postgres=# \set cond 50
    postgres=# select :cond+100 ;
     ?column? 
    ----------
          150
    (1 row)
    32. Date query in PostgreSQL
    PostgreSQL offers functions for date and time that can be used in queries.
    postgres=# select now();
                   now                
    ----------------------------------
     22-SEP-20 03:08:42.636385 +05:30
    (1 row)
    postgres=# select current_date;
    current_date
    22-SEP-20
    (1 row)
    postgres=# select current_time;
    current_time
    03:08:53.648466+05:30
    (1 row)
    We can also perform a date range query to find rows with values between two time stamps:
    postgres=# create table datetable(n int,n1 date);
    CREATE TABLE
    postgres=# insert into datetable values (1,'12-01-1980');
    INSERT 0 1
    postgres=# insert into datetable values (2,'12-01-2020');
    INSERT 0 1
    postgres=# insert into datetable values (3,'12-01-2000');
    INSERT 0 1
    postgres=# select * from datetable where n1 between '12-01-1980' and '12-01-2000';
    n |         n1
    ---+--------------------
    1 | 12-JAN-80 00:00:00
    3 | 12-JAN-00 00:00:00
    (2 rows)
    33. PostgreSQL function RETURN QUERY result
    When a PL/pgSQL function is declared to return a SETOF some data type, the return is specified by a RETURN QUERY command:
    postgres=# CREATE FUNCTION get(int) RETURNS SETOF integer AS
    $BODY$
    BEGIN
        RETURN QUERY SELECT age
                       FROM dummy_table
                      WHERE age >= $1  ;
        RETURN;
     END
    $BODY$
    LANGUAGE plpgsql;
    postgres=# select * from get(9);
    get
    25
    35
    40
    50
    (4 rows)
    34. PostgreSQL parallel query performance
    Parallel queries in PostgreSQL allow you to finish queries faster by utilizing many CPUs. These GUCs parameters are set in postgresql.conf file:
    #max_parallel_maintenance_workers = 2   # taken from max_parallel_workers
    #max_parallel_workers_per_gather = 2    # taken from max_parallel_workers
    #parallel_leader_participation = on
    #max_parallel_workers = 8               # maximum number of max_worker_processes that
                                                               # can be used in parallel operations
    postgres=# create table ty(n int);
    CREATE TABLE
    postgres=# insert into ty values (generate_series(1,300000));
    INSERT 0 300000
    postgres=# analyze ty;
    ANALYZE
    postgres=# explain  select * from ty where n<=1;
    QUERY PLAN
    Gather  (cost=1000.00..4536.88 rows=30 width=4)
    Workers Planned: 1
    ->  Parallel Seq Scan on ty  (cost=0.00..3533.88 rows=18 width=4)
    Filter: (n <= 1)
    (4 rows)
    postgres=#
    35. Logical operators in PostgreSQL
    There are three basic logical operators available in PostgreSQL: AND, OR, and NOT.
    These operators are used to match conditions in SQL statements—e.g., in WHERE and HAVING clauses.
    AND = when both boolean expressions are true then it will return TRUE
    OR   = when any boolean expression is true then it will return TRUE
    NOT = reverses the value of Boolean operator
    Some logical operator examples
    If both expressions are true, then the result is TRUE. postgresql=# select 1=1/1 and 200=2+198 as result_and_operator; result_and_operator --------------------- t (1 row) postgresql=#
    If one expression is true and another expression is NULL, then the result is NULL. postgresql=# select 4=4 and null; ?column? ---------- (1 row)
    If one expression is true and another expression is false, then the result is TRUE. postgres=# select 1=100 OR 2=2; ?column? ---------- t (1 row)
    36. Catching duplicate rows in a PostgreSQL table
    In the following SQL query, there are two records with the value 50:
    postgres=# select age from dummy_table;
     age 
    -----
      25
      35
      40
      50
      50
    (5 rows)
    We can use the following SELECT … HAVING query to find the duplicate rows:
    postgres=#  select age, count(age) from dummy_table group by age having count(age)>1;
     age | count 
    -----+-------
      50 |     2
    (1 row)
    37. Enum query in PostgreSQL
    Enumerated (enum) types are data types that comprise a static, ordered set of values.
    postgres=# CREATE TYPE mood AS ENUM ('sad', 'ok', 'happy');
    CREATE TYPE
    postgres=# create table testi(n int, n1 mood);
    CREATE TABLE
    postgres=# insert into testi values (1,'happy');
    INSERT 0 1
    postgres=# insert into testi values (1,'sad');
    INSERT 0 1
    postgres=# insert into testi values (1,'ok');
    INSERT 0 1
    If the enum has not been specified, it will give an error:
    postgres=# insert into testi values (1,'happyo');
    ERROR:  invalid input value for enum mood: "happyo"
    38. Pivot query in PostgreSQL
    A pivot table is a useful way to analyze large quantities of data by organizing it into a more manageable format.
    CREATE TABLE newtb(id SERIAL, rowid varchar(10), attri varchar(10), val varchar(10));
    INSERT INTO newtb(rowid, attri, val) values('t1','a1','v1');
    INSERT INTO newtb(rowid, attri, val) values('t1','a2','v2');
    INSERT INTO newtb(rowid, attri, val) values('t1','a3','v3');
    INSERT INTO newtb(rowid, attri, val) values('t1','a4','v4');
    INSERT INTO newtb(rowid, attri, val) values('t2','a1','v5');
    INSERT INTO newtb(rowid, attri, val) values('t2','a2','v6');
    INSERT INTO newtb(rowid, attri, val) values('t2','a3','v7');
    INSERT INTO newtb(rowid, attri, val) values('t2','a4','v8');
    To create a pivot table you need to install the tablefunc extension:
    postgres=# create extension tablefunc;
    CREATE EXTENSION
    Select *
    FROM crosstab(
    'select rowid, attri, val
    from newtb
    where attri = ''a2'' or attri = ''a3''
    order by 1,2')
    AS newtb(row_name varchar(10), category_1 varchar(10), category_2 varchar(10), category_3 varchar(10));
    row_name | category_1 | category_2 | category_3
    ----------+------------+------------+--------------------------
    t1       |              v2        |            v3    |
    t2       |             v6         |             v7   |
    (2 rows)
    39. SELF JOIN query in PostgreSQL
    When we join a table against itself, this is called a SELF JOIN. This can be done using INNER JOIN or LEFT JOIN. SELF JOINs are useful when comparing the columns of rows within the same table:
    postgres=# create table emp1(emp_id int, firstname char(10), lastname char(10) , manager_id int);
    CREATE TABLE
    postgres=# 
    postgres=# 
    postgres=# insert into emp1 values(1,'ABC','XYZ',NULL);
    INSERT 0 1
    postgres=# insert into emp1 values(2,'TYU','BGV',1);
    INSERT 0 1
    postgres=# insert into emp1 values(3,'TEU','ZZV',1);
    INSERT 0 1
    postgres=# insert into emp1 values(4,'REU','AZV',2);
    INSERT 0 1
    postgres=# insert into emp1 values(5,'QREU','WZV',2);
    INSERT 0 1
    postgres=# insert into emp1 values(6,'DREU','QZV',3);
    INSERT 0 1
    postgres=# select a.firstname,b.lastname from emp1 a inner join emp1 b on a.emp_id=b.manager_id order by 1 ;
    firstname  |  lastname
    ------------+------------
    ABC        | ZZV
    ABC        | BGV
    TEU        | QZV
    TYU        | WZV
    TYU        | AZV
    (5 rows)
    postgres=#
    40. Parent-child recursive query in PostgreSQL
    With the help of common table expressions (CTE) we can perform parent-child recursive queries:
    postgres=# CREATE TABLE recu_pc (
     id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
     name varchar(10) NOT NULL,
     parent_id integer );
    CREATE TABLE
    postgres=# insert into recu_pc values (1, 'Grandmother', NULL);
    INSERT 0 1
    postgres=# insert into recu_pc values (2, 'mother', 1);
    INSERT 0 1
    postgres=# insert into recu_pc values (3, 'daughter', 2);
    INSERT 0 1
    postgres=# WITH RECURSIVE rec_q (id) as
    (
    SELECT recu_pc.id, recu_pc.name from recu_pc where name='mother'
    UNION ALL
    SELECT recu_pc.id, recu_pc.name from rec_q, recu_pc where recu_pc.parent_id = rec_q.id
    )
    SELECT *
    FROM rec_q;
    id |   name
    ----+----------
    2 | mother
    3 | daughter
    (2 rows)
    41. Defining a variable in a query in PostgreSQL
    Using an anonymous block, we can define a variable that can be passed to in a query:
    postgres=# do 
    $$
    declare 
    a int;
    begin 
    select age into a from dummy_table  
    where name ='XYZ';
    raise notice '%',a; 
    end;
    $$;
    NOTICE:  25
    DO
    42. PREPARE statement in PostgreSQL
    A prepared statement is used to optimize performance. When the PREPARE statement is executed, it is not only parsed but analyzed too, and when we fire the EXECUTE command the prepared statement is planned and executed.
    Prepared statements can accept parameters.
    postgres=# prepare test(int) as 
    select * from dummy_table where age=$1;
    PREPARE
    postgres=# execute test(50);
    name |  address   | age
    ------+------------+---------
    PQR  | location-D |  50
    CXC | 1                |  50
    (2 rows)
    43. Checking NULL values in PostgreSQL
    To Identify or select rows that have NULL values, the IS NULL condition can be used in the WHERE clause.
    postgres=# select * from dummy_table;
     name |  address   | age 
    ------+------------+-----
     XYZ  | location-A |  25
     ABC  | location-B |  35
     DEF  | location-C |  40
     PQR  | location-D |  54
     PQR  | location-D |    
    (5 rows)
    Identifying null values in ‘age’ column:
    postgres=# select name from dummy_table where age is null;
     name 
    ------
     PQR
    (1 row)

    PostgreSQL Setup For Windows & WSL/Ubuntu



    If you follow this guide to a tee… you will install PostgreSQL itself on your Windows installation. Then, you will install psql in your Ubuntu installation. Then you will also install Postbird, a cross-platform graphical user interface that makes working with SQL and PostgreSQL ‘allegedly’ …(personally I prefer to just use the command line but PG Admin makes for an immeasurably more complicated tutorial than postbird)… better than just using the command line tool psql.
    Important Distinction: PSQL is the frontend interface for PostgreSQL … they are not synonymous!
    Postgres, is a free and open-source relational database management system (RDBMS)
    PSQL:
    The primary front-end for PostgreSQL is the psql command-line program, which can be used to enter SQL queries directly, or execute them from a file.
    In addition, psql provides a number of meta-commands and various shell-like features to facilitate writing scripts and automating a wide variety of tasks; for example tab completion of object names and SQL syntax.
    pgAdmin:
    The pgAdmin package is a free and open-source graphical user interface (GUI) administration tool for PostgreSQL.
    When you read “installation”, that means the actual OS that’s running on your machine. So, you have a Windows installation, Windows 10, that’s running when you boot your computer. Then, when you start the Ubuntu installation, it’s as if there’s a completely separate computer running inside your computer. It’s like having two completely different laptops.
    Other Noteworthy Distinctions:



    Installing PostgreSQL 12
    To install PostgreSQL 12, you need to download the installer from the Internet. PostgreSQL’s commercial company, Enterprise DB, offers installers for PostgreSQL for every major platform.
    Open https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads. Click the link for PostgreSQL 12 for Windows x86–64.



    Once that installer downloads, run it. You need to go through the normal steps of installing software.

    Yes, Windows, let the installer make changes to my device.
    Thanks for the welcome. Next.
    Yeah, that’s a good place to install it. Next.
    I don’t want that pgAdmin nor the Stack Builder things. Uncheck. Uncheck. Next.





    Also, great looking directory. Thanks. Next.

    Oooh! A password! I’ll enter ****. I sure won’t forget that because, if I do, I’ll have to uninstall and reinstall PostgreSQL and lose all of my hard work. Seriously, write down this password or use one you will not forget!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
    I REALLY CANNOT STRESS THE ABOVE POINT ENOUGH… Experience is a great teacher but in this case … it’s not worth it.

    Sure. 5432. Good to go. Next.
    Not even sure what that means. Default! Next.
    Yep. Looks good. Next.

    Insert pop culture reference to pass the time
    Installing PostgreSQL Client Tools on Ubuntu
    Now, to install the PostgreSQL Client tools for Ubuntu. You need to do this so that the Node.js (and later Python) programs running on your Ubuntu installation can access the PostgreSQL server running on your Windows installation. You need to tell apt, the package manager, that you want it to go find the PostgreSQL 12 client tools from PostgreSQL itself rather than the common package repositories. You do that by issuing the following two commands. Copy and paste them one at a time into your shell. (If your Ubuntu shell isn’t running, start one.)
    Pro-tip: Copy those commands because you’re not going to type them, right? After you copy one of them, you can just right-click on the Ubuntu shell. That should paste them in there for you.
    wget --quiet -O - https://www.postgresql.org/media/keys/ACCC4CF8.asc | sudo apt-key add -
    If prompted for your password, type it.
    echo "deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/ `lsb_release -cs`-pgdg main" | sudo tee  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgdg.list
    The last line of output of those two commands running should read “OK”. If it does not, try copying and pasting them one at a time.
    Now that you’ve registered the PostgreSQL repositories as a source to look for PostgreSQL, you need to update the apt registry. You should do this before you install any software on Ubuntu.
    sudo apt update
    Once that’s finished running, the new entries for PostgreSQL 12 should be in the repository. Now, you can install them with the following command.
    sudo apt install postgresql-client-12 postgresql-common
    If it asks you if you want to install them, please tell it “Y”.
    Test that it installed by typing psql --version. You should see it print out information about the version of the installed tools. If it tells you that it can’t find the command, try these instructions over.
    Configuring the client tools
    Since you’re going to be accessing the PosgreSQL installation from your Ubuntu installation on your Windows installation, you’re going to have to type that you want to access it over and over, which means extra typing. To prevent you from having to do this, you can customize your shell to always add the extra commands for you.
    This assumes you’re still using Bash. If you changed the shell that your Ubuntu installation uses, please follow that shell’s directions for adding an alias to its startup file.
    Make sure you’re in your Ubuntu home directory. You can do that by typing cd and hitting enter. Use ls to find out if you have a .bashrc file. Type ls .bashrc. If it shows you that one exists, that’s the one you will add the alias to. If it tells you that there is no file named that, then type ls .profile. If it shows you that one exists, that’s the one you will add the alias to. If it shows you that it does not exist, then use the file name .bashrc in the following section.
    Now that you know which profile file to use, type code «profile file name» where “profile file name” is the name of the file you determined from the last section. Once Visual Studio Code starts up with your file, at the end of it (or if you’ve already added aliases, in that section), type the following.
    alias psql="psql -h localhost"
    When you run psql from the command line, it will now always add the part about wanting to connect to localhost every time. You would have to type that each time, otherwise.
    To make sure that you set that up correctly, type psql -U postgres postgres. This tells the psql client that you want to connect as the user “postgres” (-U postgres) to the database postgres (postgres at the end), which is the default database created when PostgreSQL is installed. It will prompt you for a password. Type the password that you used when you installed PostgrSQL, earlier. If the alias works correctly and you type the correct password, then you should see something like the following output.
    psql (12.2 (Ubuntu 12.2-2.pgdg18.04+1))
    Type "help" for help.
    postgres=#
    Type \q and hit Enter to exit the PostgreSQL client tool.
    Now, you will add a user for your Ubuntu identity so that you don’t have to specify it all the time. Then, you will create a file that PostgreSQL will use to automatically send your password every time.
    Copy and paste the following into your Ubuntu shell. Think of a password that you want to use for your user. Replace the password in the single quotes in the command with the password that you want. It has to be a non-empty string. PostgreSQL doesn’t like it when it’s not.
    psql -U postgres -c "CREATE USER `whoami` WITH PASSWORD 'password' SUPERUSER"
    It should prompt you for a password. Type the password that you created when you installed PostgreSQL. Once you type the correct password, you should see “CREATE ROLE”.
    Now you will create your PostgreSQL password file. Type the following into your Ubuntu shell to open Visual Studio Code and create a new file.
    code ~/.pgpass
    In that file, you will add this line, which tells it that on localhost for port 5432 (where PostgreSQL is running), for all databases (*), use your Ubuntu user name and the password that you just created for that user with the psql command you just typed. (If you have forgotten your Ubuntu user name, type whoami on the command line.) Your entry in the file should have this format.
    localhost:5432:*:«your Ubuntu user name»:«the password you just used»
    Once you have that information in the file, save it, and close Visual Studio Code.
    The last step you have to take is change the permission on that file so that it is only readable by your user. PostgreSQL will ignore it if just anyone can read and write to it. This is for your security. Change the file permissions so only you can read and write to it. You did this once upon a time. Here’s the command.
    chmod go-rw ~/.pgpass
    You can confirm that only you have read/write permission by typing ls -al ~/.pgpass. That should return output that looks like this, with your Ubuntu user name instead of “web-dev-hub”.
    -rw------- 1 web-dev-hub web-dev-hub 37 Mar 28 21:20 /home/web-dev-hub/.pgpass
    Now, try connecting to PostreSQL by typing psql postgres. Because you added the alias to your startup script, and because you created your .pgpass file, it should now connect without prompting you for any credentials! Type \q and press Enter to exit the PostgreSQL command line client.
    Installing Postbird
    Head over to the Postbird releases page on GitHub. Click the installer for Windows which you can recognize because it’s the only file in the list that ends with “.exe”.



    After that installer downloads, run it. You will get a warning from Windows that this is from an unidentified developer. If you don’t want to install this, find a PostgreSQL GUI client that you do trust and install it or do everything from the command line.



    You should get used to seeing this because many open-source applications aren’t signed with the Microsoft Store for monetary and philosophical reasons.
    Otherwise, if you trust Paxa like web-dev-hub and tens of thousands of other developers do, then click the link that reads “More info” and the “Run anyway” button.



    When it’s done installing, it will launch itself. Test it out by typing the “postgres” into the “Username” field and the password from your installation in the “Password” field. Click the Connect button. It should properly connect to the running
    You can close it for now. It also installed an icon on your desktop. You can launch it from there or your Start Menu at any time.
    Now.. if you still have some gas in the tank… let’s put our new tools to work:
    The node-postgres
    The node-postgres is a collection of Node.js modules for interfacing with the PostgreSQL database. It has support for callbacks, promises, async/await, connection pooling, prepared statements, cursors, and streaming results.
    In our examples we also use the Ramda library. See Ramda tutorial for more information.
    Setting up node-postgres
    First, we install node-postgres.
    $ node -v
    v14.2
    $ npm init -y
    We initiate a new Node application.
    npm i pg
    We install node-postgres with nmp i pg.
    npm i ramda
    In addition, we install Ramda for beautiful work with data.
    cars.sql
    DROP TABLE IF EXISTS cars;
    CREATE TABLE cars(id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(255), price INT);
    INSERT INTO cars(name, price) VALUES(‘Audi’, 52642);
    INSERT INTO cars(name, price) VALUES(‘Mercedes’, 57127);
    INSERT INTO cars(name, price) VALUES(‘Skoda’, 9000);
    INSERT INTO cars(name, price) VALUES(‘Volvo’, 29000);
    INSERT INTO cars(name, price) VALUES(‘Bentley’, 350000);
    INSERT INTO cars(name, price) VALUES(‘Citroen’, 21000);
    INSERT INTO cars(name, price) VALUES(‘Hummer’, 41400);
    INSERT INTO cars(name, price) VALUES(‘Volkswagen’, 21600);
    In some of the examples, we use this cars table.
    The node-postgres first example
    In the first example, we connect to the PostgreSQL database and return a simple SELECT query result.
    first.js
    const pg = require(‘pg’);
    const R = require(‘ramda’);
    const cs = ‘postgres://postgres:s$cret@localhost:5432/ydb’;
    const client = new pg.Client(cs);
    client.connect();
    client.query(‘SELECT 1 + 4’).then(res => {
    const result = R.head(R.values(R.head(res.rows)))
    console.log(result)
    }).finally(() => client.end());
    The example connects to the database and issues a SELECT statement.
    const pg = require(‘pg’);
    const R = require(‘ramda’);
    We include the pg and ramda modules.
    const cs = ‘postgres://postgres:s$cret@localhost:5432/ydb’;
    This is the PostgreSQL connection string. It is used to build a connection to the database.
    const client = new pg.Client(cs);
    client.connect();
    A client is created. We connect to the database with connect().
    client.query(‘SELECT 1 + 4’).then(res => {
    const result = R.head(R.values(R.head(res.rows)));
    console.log(result);
    }).finally(() => client.end());
    We issue a simple SELECT query. We get the result and output it to the console. The res.rows is an array of objects; we use Ramda to get the returned scalar value. In the end, we close the connection with end().
    node first.js
    5
    This is the output.
    The node-postgres column names
    In the following example, we get the columns names of a database.

    column_names.js

    const pg = require(‘pg’);
    const cs = ‘postgres://postgres:s$cret@localhost:5432/ydb’;
    const client = new pg.Client(cs);
    client.connect();
    client.query(‘SELECT * FROM cars’).then(res => {
    const fields = res.fields.map(field => field.name);
    console.log(fields);
    }).catch(err => {
    console.log(err.stack);
    }).finally(() => {
    client.end()
    });
    The column names are retrieved with res.fields attribute. We also use the catch clause to output potential errors.
    node column_names.js
    ‘id’, ‘name’, ‘price’′id′,′name′,′price′
    The output shows three column names of the cars table.
    Selecting all rows
    In the next example, we select all rows from the database table.

    all_rows.js

    const pg = require(‘pg’);
    const R = require(‘ramda’);
    const cs = ‘postgres://postgres:s$cret@localhost:5432/ydb’;
    const client = new pg.Client(cs);
    client.connect();
    client.query(‘SELECT * FROM cars’).then(res => {
    const data = res.rows;
    console.log('all data');
    data.forEach(row => {
    console.log(`Id: row.idName:{row.id} Name:row.idName:{row.name} Price: ${row.price}`);
    })
    console.log('Sorted prices:');
    const prices = R.pluck('price', R.sortBy(R.prop('price'), data));
    console.log(prices);
    }).finally(() => {
    client.end()
    });

    Each table is made up of rows and columns. If you think of a table as a grid, the column go from left to right across the grid and each entry of data is listed down as a row.



    ALLOFMYOTHERARTICLES bryanguner.medium.com
    Each row in a relational is uniquely identified by a primary key. This can be by one or more sets of column values. In most scenarios it is a single column, such as employeeID.
    Every relational table has one primary key. Its purpose is to uniquely identify each row in the database. No two rows can have the same primary key value. The practical result of this is that you can select every single row by just knowing its primary key.
    SQL Server UNIQUE constraints allow you to ensure that the data stored in a column, or a group of columns, is unique among the rows in a table.
    Although both UNIQUE and PRIMARY KEY constraints enforce the uniqueness of data, you should use the UNIQUE constraint instead of PRIMARY KEY constraint when you want to enforce the uniqueness of a column, or a group of columns, that are not the primary key columns.
    Different from PRIMARY KEY constraints, UNIQUE constraints allow NULL. Moreover, UNIQUE constraints treat the NULL as a regular value, therefore, it only allows one NULL per column.

    Postgres & JSON:
    Creating the DB and the Table
    DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS books_db;
    CREATE DATABASE books_db WITH ENCODING='UTF8' TEMPLATE template0;
    DROP TABLE IF EXISTS books;
    CREATE TABLE books (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    client VARCHAR NOT NULL,
    data JSONb NOT NULL
    );
    Populating the DB
    INSERT INTO books(client, data) values( 'Joe', '{ "title": "Siddhartha", "author": { "first_name": "Herman", "last_name": "Hesse" } }' ); INSERT INTO books(client, data) values('Jenny', '{ "title": "Bryan Guner", "author": { "first_name": "Jack", "last_name": "Kerouac" } }'); INSERT INTO books(client, data) values('Jenny', '{ "title": "100 años de soledad", "author": { "first_name": "Gabo", "last_name": "Marquéz" } }');
    Lets see everything inside the table books:
    SELECT * FROM books;
    Output:



    -> operator returns values out of JSON columns
    Selecting 1 column:
    SELECT client, 
        data->'title' AS title
        FROM books;
    Output:



    Selecting 2 columns:
    SELECT client, 
       data->'title' AS title, data->'author' AS author
       FROM books;
    Output:



    -> vs ->>
    The -> operator returns the original JSON type (which might be an object), whereas ->> returns text.
    Return NESTED objects
    You can use the -> to return a nested object and thus chain the operators:
    SELECT client, 
       data->'author'->'last_name' AS author
       FROM books;
    Output:



    Filtering
    Select rows based on a value inside your JSON:
    SELECT 
     client,
     data->'title' AS title
     FROM books
      WHERE data->'title' = '"Bryan Guner"';
    Notice WHERE uses -> so we must compare to JSON '"Bryan Guner"'
    Or we could use ->> and compare to 'Bryan Guner'
    Output:



    Nested filtering
    Find rows based on the value of a nested JSON object:
    SELECT 
     client,
     data->'title' AS title
     FROM books
      WHERE data->'author'->>'last_name' = 'Kerouac';
    Output:



    A real world example
    CREATE TABLE events (
      name varchar(200),
      visitor_id varchar(200),
      properties json,
      browser json
    );
    We’re going to store events in this table, like pageviews. Each event has properties, which could be anything (e.g. current page) and also sends information about the browser (like OS, screen resolution, etc). Both of these are completely free form and could change over time (as we think of extra stuff to track).
    INSERT INTO events VALUES (
      'pageview', '1',
      '{ "page": "/" }',
      '{ "name": "Chrome", "os": "Mac", "resolution": { "x": 1440, "y": 900 } }'
    );
    INSERT INTO events VALUES (
      'pageview', '2',
      '{ "page": "/" }',
      '{ "name": "Firefox", "os": "Windows", "resolution": { "x": 1920, "y": 1200 } }'
    );
    INSERT INTO events VALUES (
      'pageview', '1',
      '{ "page": "/account" }',
      '{ "name": "Chrome", "os": "Mac", "resolution": { "x": 1440, "y": 900 } }'
    );
    INSERT INTO events VALUES (
      'purchase', '5',
      '{ "amount": 10 }',
      '{ "name": "Firefox", "os": "Windows", "resolution": { "x": 1024, "y": 768 } }'
    );
    INSERT INTO events VALUES (
      'purchase', '15',
      '{ "amount": 200 }',
      '{ "name": "Firefox", "os": "Windows", "resolution": { "x": 1280, "y": 800 } }'
    );
    INSERT INTO events VALUES (
      'purchase', '15',
      '{ "amount": 500 }',
      '{ "name": "Firefox", "os": "Windows", "resolution": { "x": 1280, "y": 800 } }'
    );
    Now lets select everything:
    SELECT * FROM events;
    Output:



    JSON operators + PostgreSQL aggregate functions
    Using the JSON operators, combined with traditional PostgreSQL aggregate functions, we can pull out whatever we want. You have the full might of an RDBMS at your disposal.

    Lets see browser usage:
    SELECT browser->>'name' AS browser, count(browser) FROM events GROUP BY browser->>'name';

    Output:




    Total revenue per visitor:

    SELECT visitor_id, SUM(CAST(properties->>'amount' AS integer)) AS total FROM events WHERE CAST(properties->>'amount' AS integer) > 0 GROUP BY visitor_id;
    Output:




    Average screen resolution
    SELECT AVG(CAST(browser->'resolution'->>'x' AS integer)) AS width, AVG(CAST(browser->'resolution'->>'y' AS integer)) AS height FROM events;

    Output:

    print is the equivalent of console.log.


    ‘print() == console.log()’

        secretThing()

    Python has a built in help function that let’s you see a description of the source code without having to navigate to it… “-SickNasty … Autor Unknown”


    Numbers

    Python has three types of numbers:


    Integer
    Positive and Negative Counting Numbers.

    No Decimal Point

    Created by a literal non-decimal point number … or … with the int() constructor.

    print(3) # => 3 
    print(int(19)) # => 19 
    print(int()) # => 0
    3. Complex Numbers

    Consist of a real part and imaginary part.

    Boolean is a subtype of integer in Python.🤷‍♂️

    If you came from a background in JavaScript and learned to accept the premise(s) of the following meme…




    Than I am sure you will find the means to suspend your disbelief.
    print(2.24) # => 2.24 
    print(2.) # => 2.0 
    print(float()) # => 0.0 
    print(27e-5) # => 0.00027
    KEEP IN MIND:

    The i is switched to a j in programming.

    This is because the letter i is common place as the de facto index for any and all enumerable entities so it just makes sense not to compete for name-space when there’s another 25 letters that don’t get used for every loop under the sun. My most medium apologies to Leonhard Euler.
    print(7j) # => 7j 
    print(5.1+7.7j)) # => 5.1+7.7j 
    print(complex(3, 5)) # => 3+5j 
    print(complex(17)) # => 17+0j 
    print(complex()) # => 0j

    Type Casting : The process of converting one number to another.

    # Using Float
    print(17)               # => 17
    print(float(17))        # => 17.0

    # Using Int
    print(17.0)             # => 17.0
    print(int(17.0))        # => 17

    # Using Str
    print(str(17.0) + ' and ' + str(17))        # => 17.0 and 17
    The arithmetic operators are the same between JS and Python, with two additions:

    “**” : Double asterisk for exponent.
    “//” : Integer Division.
    There are no spaces between math operations in Python.
    Integer Division gives the other part of the number from Module; it is a way to do round down numbers replacing Math.floor() in JS.
    There are no ++ and -- in Python, the only shorthand operators are:





    Strings

    Python uses both single and double quotes.
    You can escape strings like so 'Jodi asked, "What\'s up, Sam?"'
    Multiline strings use triple quotes.

    print('''My instructions are very long so to make them
    more readable in the code I am putting them on
    more than one line. I can even include "quotes"
    of any kind because they won't get confused with
    the end of the string!''')
    Use the len() function to get the length of a string.
    print(len(“Spaghetti”)) # => 9
    Python uses zero-based indexing
    Python allows negative indexing (thank god!)
    print(“Spaghetti”[-1]) # => i 
    print(“Spaghetti”[-4]) # => e

    Python let’s you use ranges

    You can think of this as roughly equivalent to the slice method called on a JavaScript object or string… (mind you that in JS … strings are wrapped in an object (under the hood)… upon which the string methods are actually called. As a immutable privative type by textbook definition, a string literal could not hope to invoke most of it’s methods without violating the state it was bound to on initialization if it were not for this bit of syntactic sugar.)
    print(“Spaghetti”[1:4]) # => pag 
    print(“Spaghetti”[4:-1]) # => hett 
    print(“Spaghetti”[4:4]) # => (empty string)

    The end range is exclusive just like slice in JS.

    # Shortcut to get from the beginning of a string to a certain index.
    print("Spaghetti"[:4])  # => Spag
    print("Spaghetti"[:-1])    # => Spaghett

    # Shortcut to get from a certain index to the end of a string.
    print("Spaghetti"[1:])  # => paghetti
    print("Spaghetti"[-4:])    # => etti

    The index string function is the equiv. of indexOf() in JS

    print("Spaghetti".index("h"))    # => 4
    print("Spaghetti".index("t"))    # => 6

    The count function finds out how many times a substring appears in a string… pretty nifty for a hard coded feature of the language.

    print("Spaghetti".count("h"))    # => 1
    print("Spaghetti".count("t"))    # => 2
    print("Spaghetti".count("s"))    # => 0
    print('''We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things,
    not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will
    serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that
    challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to
    postpone, and one which we intend to win, and the others, too.
    '''.count('the '))                # => 4

    You can use + to concatenate strings, just like in JS.
    You can also use “*” to repeat strings or multiply strings.
    Use the format() function to use placeholders in a string to input values later on.

    first_name = "Billy"
    last_name = "Bob"
    print('Your name is {0} {1}'.format(first_name, last_name))  # => Your name is Billy Bob

    Shorthand way to use format function is:
    print(f'Your name is {first_name} {last_name}')

    Some useful string methods.

    Note that in JS join is used on an Array, in Python it is used on String.





    There are also many handy testing methods.





    Variables and Expressions

    Duck-Typing : Programming Style which avoids checking an object’s type to figure out what it can do.
    Duck Typing is the fundamental approach of Python.
    Assignment of a value automatically declares a variable.

    a = 7
    b = 'Marbles'
    print(a)         # => 7
    print(b)         # => Marbles

    You can chain variable assignments to give multiple var names the same value.

    Use with caution as this is highly unreadable
    count = max = min = 0
    print(count)           # => 0
    print(max)             # => 0
    print(min)             # => 0
    The value and type of a variable can be re-assigned at any time.
    a = 17
    print(a)         # => 17
    a = 'seventeen'
    print(a)         # => seventeen

    NaN does not exist in Python, but you can ‘create’ it like so:
    print(float("nan"))
    Python replaces null with none.
    none is an object and can be directly assigned to a variable.


    Using none is a convenient way to check to see why an action may not be operating correctly in your program.


    Boolean Data Type

    One of the biggest benefits of Python is that it reads more like English than JS does.




    Logical AND
    print(True and True)    # => True
    print(True and False)   # => False
    print(False and False)  # => False
    Logical OR
    print(True or True)     # => True
    print(True or False)    # => True
    print(False or False)   # => False
    Logical NOT
    print(not True)             # => False
    print(not False and True)   # => True
    print(not True or False)    # => False

    By default, Python considers an object to be true UNLESS it is one of the following:
    Constant None or False
    Zero of any numeric type.
    Empty Sequence or Collection.
    True and False must be capitalized


    Comparison Operators

    Python uses all the same equality operators as JS.
    In Python, equality operators are processed from left to right.
    Logical operators are processed in this order:


    NOT
    AND
    OR


    Just like in JS, you can use parentheses to change the inherent order of operations.


    Short Circuit : Stopping a program when a true or false has been reached.





    Identity vs Equality
    print (2 == '2')    # => False
    print (2 is '2')    # => False
    print ("2" == '2')    # => True
    print ("2" is '2')    # => True
    There is a distinction between the number types.
    print (2 == 2.0)    # => True
    print (2 is 2.0)    # => False

    In the Python community it is better to use is and is not over == or !=


    If Statements
    if name == 'Monica':
        print('Hi, Monica.')
    if name == 'Monica':
    print('Hi, Monica.')
    else:
    print('Hello, stranger.')
    if name == 'Monica':
    print('Hi, Monica.')
    elif age < 12:
    print('You are not Monica, kiddo.')
    elif age > 2000:
    print('Unlike you, Monica is not an undead, immortal vampire.')
    elif age > 100:
    print('You are not Monica, grannie.')

    Remember the order of elif statements matter.


    While Statements
    spam = 0
    while spam < 5:
      print('Hello, world.')
      spam = spam + 1

    Break statement also exists in Python.

    spam = 0
    while True:
      print('Hello, world.')
      spam = spam + 1
      if spam >= 5:
        break

    As are continue statements

    spam = 0
    while True:
      print('Hello, world.')
      spam = spam + 1
      if spam < 5:
        continue
      break

    Try/Except Statements

    Python equivalent to try/catch

    a = 321
    try:
        print(len(a))
    except:
        print('Silently handle error here')

        # Optionally include a correction to the issue
        a = str(a)
        print(len(a)

    a = '321'
    try:
        print(len(a))
    except:
        print('Silently handle error here')

        # Optionally include a correction to the issue
        a = str(a)
        print(len(a))

    You can name an error to give the output more specificity.

    a = 100
    b = 0
    try:
        c = a / b
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        c = None
    print(c)

    You can also use the pass commmand to by pass a certain error.

    a = 100
    b = 0
    try:
        print(a / b)
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        pass

    The pass method won’t allow you to bypass every single error so you can chain an exception series like so:

    a = 100
    # b = "5"
    try:
        print(a / b)
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        pass
    except (TypeError, NameError):
        print("ERROR!")

    You can use an else statement to end a chain of except statements.

    # tuple of file names
    files = ('one.txt', 'two.txt', 'three.txt')

    # simple loop
    for filename in files:
        try:
            # open the file in read mode
            f = open(filename, 'r')
        except OSError:
            # handle the case where file does not exist or permission is denied
            print('cannot open file', filename)
        else:
            # do stuff with the file object (f)
            print(filename, 'opened successfully')
            print('found', len(f.readlines()), 'lines')
            f.close()

    finally is used at the end to clean up all actions under any circumstance.

    def divide(x, y):
        try:
            result = x / y
        except ZeroDivisionError:
            print("Cannot divide by zero")
        else:
            print("Result is", result)
        finally:
            print("Finally...")

    Using duck typing to check to see if some value is able to use a certain method.

    # Try a number - nothing will print out
    a = 321
    if hasattr(a, '__len__'):
        print(len(a))

    # Try a string - the length will print out (4 in this case)
    b = "5555"
    if hasattr(b, '__len__'):
        print(len(b))

    Pass

    Pass Keyword is required to write the JS equivalent of :

    if (true) {
    }

    while (true) {}

    if True:
      pass

    while True:
      pass

    Functions

    Function definition includes:
    The def keyword
    The name of the function
    A list of parameters enclosed in parentheses.
    A colon at the end of the line.
    One tab indentation for the code to run.
    You can use default parameters just like in JS

    def greeting(name, saying="Hello"):
        print(saying, name)

    greeting("Monica")
    # Hello Monica

    greeting("Barry", "Hey")
    # Hey Barry
    Keep in mind, default parameters must always come after regular parameters.
    # THIS IS BAD CODE AND WILL NOT RUN
    def increment(delta=1, value):
        return delta + value

    You can specify arguments by name without destructuring in Python.

    def greeting(name, saying="Hello"):
        print(saying, name)

    # name has no default value, so just provide the value
    # saying has a default value, so use a keyword argument
    greeting("Monica", saying="Hi")

    The lambda keyword is used to create anonymous functions and are supposed to be one-liners.

    toUpper = lambda s: s.upper()

    Notes
    Formatted Strings

    Remember that in Python join() is called on a string with an array/list passed in as the argument.
    Python has a very powerful formatting engine.
    format() is also applied directly to strings.

    shopping_list = [‘bread’,’milk’,’eggs’]
    print(‘,’.join(shopping_list))
    Comma Thousands Separator
    print(‘{:,}’.format(1234567890))
    ‘1,234,567,890’
    Date and Time
    d = datetime.datetime(2020, 7, 4, 12, 15, 58)
    print(‘{:%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S}’.format(d))
    ‘2020–07–04 12:15:58’
    Percentage
    points = 190
    total = 220
    print(‘Correct answers: {:.2%}’.format(points/total))
    Correct answers: 86.36%
    Data Tables
    width=8
    print(‘ decimal hex binary’)
    print(‘-’*27)
    for num in range(1,16):
    for base in ‘dXb’:
    print(‘{0:{width}{base}}’.format(num, base=base, width=width), end=’ ‘)
    print()
    Getting Input from the Command Line
    Python runs synchronously, all programs and processes will stop when listening for a user input.
    The input function shows a prompt to a user and waits for them to type ‘ENTER’.
    Scripts vs Programs
    Programming Script : A set of code that runs in a linear fashion.
    The largest difference between scripts and programs is the level of complexity and purpose. Programs typically have many UI’s.
    Python can be used to display html, css, and JS.
    It is common to use Python as an API (Application Programming Interface)
    Structured Data
    Sequence : The most basic data structure in Python where the index determines the order.

    List
    Tuple
    Range
    Collections : Unordered data structures, hashable values.


    Dictionaries Sets
    Iterable : Generic name for a sequence or collection; any object that can be iterated through.
    Can be mutable or immutable. Built In Data Types

    Lists are the python equivalent of arrays.
    empty_list = []
    departments = [‘HR’,’Development’,’Sales’,’Finance’,’IT’,’Customer Support’]
    You can instantiate
    specials = list()
    Test if a value is in a list.
    print(1 in [1, 2, 3]) #> True
    print(4 in [1, 2, 3]) #> False
    # Tuples : Very similar to lists, but they are immutable
    Instantiated with parentheses
    time_blocks = (‘AM’,’PM’)
    Sometimes instantiated without
    colors = ‘red’,’blue’,’green’
    numbers = 1, 2, 3
    Tuple() built in can be used to convert other data into a tuple
    tuple(‘abc’) # returns (‘a’, ‘b’, ‘c’)
    tuple([1,2,3]) # returns (1, 2, 3)
    # Think of tuples as constant variables.
    Ranges : A list of numbers which can’t be changed; often used with for loops.
    Declared using one to three parameters.

    Start : opt. default 0, first # in sequence.
    Stop : required next number past the last number in the sequence.
    Step : opt. default 1, difference between each number in the sequence.

    range(5) # [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
    range(1,5) # [1, 2, 3, 4]
    range(0, 25, 5) # [0, 5, 10, 15, 20]
    range(0) # [ ]
    for let (i = 0; i < 5; i++)
    for let (i = 1; i < 5; i++)
    for let (i = 0; i < 25; i+=5)
    for let(i = 0; i = 0; i++)
    # Keep in mind that stop is not included in the range.
    Dictionaries : Mappable collection where a hashable value is used as a key to ref. an object stored in the dictionary.
    Mutable.
    a = {‘one’:1, ‘two’:2, ‘three’:3}
    b = dict(one=1, two=2, three=3)
    c = dict([(‘two’, 2), (‘one’, 1), (‘three’, 3)])
    # a, b, and c are all equal
    Declared with curly braces of the built in dict()

    Benefit of dictionaries in Python is that it doesn’t matter how it is defined, if the keys and values are the same the dictionaries are considered equal.

    Use the in operator to see if a key exists in a dictionary.
    Sets : Unordered collection of distinct objects; objects that need to be hashable.

    Always be unique, duplicate items are auto dropped from the set.

    Common Uses:

    Removing Duplicates
    Membership Testing
    Mathematical Operators: Intersection, Union, Difference, Symmetric Difference.

    Standard Set is mutable, Python has a immutable version called frozenset.
    Sets created by putting comma seperated values inside braces:
    school_bag = {‘book’,’paper’,’pencil’,’pencil’,’book’,’book’,’book’,’eraser’}
    print(school_bag)
    Also can use set constructor to automatically put it into a set.
    letters = set(‘abracadabra’)
    print(letters)
    #Built-In Functions
    #Functions using iterables
    filter(function, iterable) : creates new iterable of the same type which includes each item for which the function returns true.
    map(function, iterable) : creates new iterable of the same type which includes the result of calling the function on every item of the iterable.
    sorted(iterable, key=None, reverse=False) : creates a new sorted list from the items in the iterable.
    Output is always a list
    key: opt function which coverts and item to a value to be compared.
    reverse: optional boolean.
    enumerate(iterable, start=0) : starts with a sequence and converts it to a series of tuples
    quarters = [‘First’, ‘Second’, ‘Third’, ‘Fourth’]
    print(enumerate(quarters))
    print(enumerate(quarters, start=1))
    (0, ‘First’), (1, ‘Second’), (2, ‘Third’), (3, ‘Fourth’)
    (1, ‘First’), (2, ‘Second’), (3, ‘Third’), (4, ‘Fourth’)

    zip(*iterables) : creates a zip object filled with tuples that combine 1 to 1 the items in each provided iterable.
    Functions that analyze iterable

    len(iterable) : returns the count of the number of items.
    max(*args, key=None) : returns the largest of two or more arguments.
    max(iterable, key=None) : returns the largest item in the iterable.
    key optional function which converts an item to a value to be compared.
    min works the same way as max
    sum(iterable) : used with a list of numbers to generate the total.
    There is a faster way to concatenate an array of strings into one string, so do not use sum for that.
    any(iterable) : returns True if any items in the iterable are true.
    all(iterable) : returns True is all items in the iterable are true.
    Working with dictionaries
    dir(dictionary) : returns the list of keys in the dictionary.
    Working with sets
    Union : The pipe | operator or union(*sets) function can be used to produce a new set which is a combination of all elements in the provided set.
    a = {1, 2, 3}
    b = {2, 4, 6}
    print(a | b) # => {1, 2, 3, 4, 6}
    Intersection : The & operator ca be used to produce a new set of only the elements that appear in all sets.
    a = {1, 2, 3}
    b = {2, 4, 6}
    print(a & b) # => {2}
    Difference : The — operator can be used to produce a new set of only the elements that appear in the first set and NOT the others.
    Symmetric Difference : The ^ operator can be used to produce a new set of only the elements that appear in exactly one set and not in both.
    a = {1, 2, 3}
    b = {2, 4, 6}
    print(a — b) # => {1, 3}
    print(b — a) # => {4, 6}
    print(a ^ b) # => {1, 3, 4, 6}

    For Statements In python, there is only one for loop.
    Always Includes:


    The for keyword

    A variable name

    The ‘in’ keyword

    An iterable of some kid

    A colon

    On the next line, an indented block of code called the for clause.


    You can use break and continue statements inside for loops as well.
    You can use the range function as the iterable for the for loop.
    print(‘My name is’)
    for i in range(5):
    print(‘Carlita Cinco (‘ + str(i) + ‘)’)
    total = 0
    for num in range(101):
    total += num
    print(total)
    Looping over a list in Python
    for c in [‘a’, ‘b’, ‘c’]:
    print(c)
    lst = [0, 1, 2, 3]
    for i in lst:
    print(i)
    Common technique is to use the len() on a pre-defined list with a for loop to iterate over the indices of the list.
    supplies = [‘pens’, ‘staplers’, ‘flame-throwers’, ‘binders’]
    for i in range(len(supplies)):
    print(‘Index ‘ + str(i) + ‘ in supplies is: ‘ + supplies[i])
    You can loop and destructure at the same time.
    l = 1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6
    for a, b in l:
    print(a, ‘, ‘, b)

    Prints 1, 2


    Prints 3, 4


    Prints 5, 6

    You can use values() and keys() to loop over dictionaries.
    spam = {‘color’: ‘red’, ‘age’: 42}
    for v in spam.values():
    print(v)
    Prints red
    Prints 42
    for k in spam.keys():
    print(k)
    Prints color
    Prints age
    For loops can also iterate over both keys and values.
    Getting tuples
    for i in spam.items():
    print(i)
    Prints (‘color’, ‘red’)
    Prints (‘age’, 42)
    Destructuring to values
    for k, v in spam.items():
    print(‘Key: ‘ + k + ‘ Value: ‘ + str(v))
    Prints Key: age Value: 42
    Prints Key: color Value: red
    Looping over string
    for c in “abcdefg”:
    print(c)
    When you order arguments within a function or function call, the args need to occur in a particular order:
    formal positional args.
    *args
    keyword args with default values
    **kwargs
    def example(arg_1, arg_2, *args, **kwargs):
    pass
    def example2(arg_1, arg_2, *args, kw_1=”shark”, kw_2=”blowfish”, **kwargs):
    pass

    Importing in Python
    Modules are similar to packages in Node.js
    Come in different types:
    Built-In,
    Third-Party,
    Custom.
    All loaded using import statements.

    Terms

    module : Python code in a separate file.
    package : Path to a directory that contains modules.
    init.py : Default file for a package.
    submodule : Another file in a module’s folder.
    function : Function in a module.

    A module can be any file but it is usually created by placing a special file init.py into a folder. pic
    Try to avoid importing with wildcards in Python.
    Use multiple lines for clarity when importing.
    from urllib.request import (
    HTTPDefaultErrorHandler as ErrorHandler,
    HTTPRedirectHandler as RedirectHandler,
    Request,
    pathname2url,
    url2pathname,
    urlopen,
    )

    Watching Out for Python 2
    Python 3 removed <> and only uses !=
    format() was introduced with P3
    All strings in P3 are unicode and encoded.
    md5 was removed.
    ConfigParser was renamed to configparser
    sets were killed in favor of set() class.
    print was a statement in P2, but is a function in P3.

    Quick Web Developers Website Checklist & A List Of Tools For Improvement
    A set of questions you should use before handing off your application to the client.

    Quick Web Developers Website Checklist & A List Of Tools For Improvement
    A set of questions you should use before handing off your application to the client.



    First off… download this developer checklist extension for chrome that literally evaluates the checkpoints on any webpage you activate it on.. it also provides advice and html validation so that you can improve your site and it’s SEO rankings!
    Web Developer Checklist Analyses any web page for violations of best practiceschrome.google.com
    Here it is in action :



    Remainder of tool list is below this checklist:

    Usefulness & Relevance:

    Does the content meet user needs, goals, and interests?


    Does the content meet business goals?


    For how long will the content be useful? When should it expire? Has its usefulness already expired?


    Is the content timely and relevant?


    Clarity & Accuracy:

    Is the content understandable to customers?


    Is the content organized logically & coherently?


    Is the content correct?


    Does the content contain factual errors, typos, or grammatical errors?


    Do images, video, and audio meet technical standards, so they are clear?


    Influence & Engagement:

    Does the content use the most appropriate techniques to influence or engage customers?


    Does the content execute those techniques effectively?


    Does the content use too many or too few techniques for the context?


    Completeness:

    Does the content include all of the information customers need or might want about a topic?


    Does the content include too much or too little information about a topic for the context?

    Voice & Style:

    Does the content consistently reflect the editorial or brand voice?


    Does its tone adjust appropriately to the context — for example, sales versus customer service?


    Does the content convey the appropriate editorial and brand qualities?


    Does the content seem to have a style? If so, does the content adhere to it consistently?


    Does the content read, look, or sound as though it’s professionally crafted?


    Usability & Findability:

    Is the content easy to scan or read?


    Is the content in a usable format, including headings, bulleted lists, tables, white space, or similar techniques, as appropriate to the content?


    Does the content have the appropriate metadata?


    Does the content follow search engine optimization (SEO) guidelines — such as using keywords — without sacrificing quality in other areas?


    Can customers find the content when searching using relevant keywords?


    SEO Advice From Google:
    Help Google find your pages

    Ensure that all pages on the site can be reached by a link from another findable page. The referring link should include either text or, for images, an alt attribute, that is relevant to the target page. Crawlable links are <a> tags with an href attribute.
    Provide a sitemap file with links that point to the important pages on your site. Also provide a page with a human-readable list of links to these pages (sometimes called a site index or site map page).
    Limit the number of links on a page to a reasonable number (a few thousand at most).
    Make sure that your web server correctly supports the If-Modified-Since HTTP header. This feature directs your web server to tell Google if your content has changed since we last crawled your site. Supporting this feature saves you bandwidth and overhead.
    Use the robots.txt file on your web server to manage your crawling budget by preventing crawling of infinite spaces such as search result pages. Keep your robots.txt file up to date. Learn how to manage crawling with the robots.txt file. Test the coverage and syntax of your robots.txt file using the robots.txt Tester.

    Ways to help Google find your site:

    Ask Google to crawl your pages.
    Make sure that any sites that should know about your pages are aware your site is online.

    Help Google understand your pages

    Create a useful, information-rich site, and write pages that clearly and accurately describe your content.
    Think about the words users would type to find your pages, and make sure that your site actually includes those words within it.
    Ensure that your <title> elements and alt attributes are descriptive, specific, and accurate.
    Design your site to have a clear conceptual page hierarchy.
    Follow our recommended best practices for images, video, and structured data.
    When using a content management system (for example, Wix or WordPress), make sure that it creates pages and links that search engines can crawl.
    To help Google fully understand your site’s contents, allow all site assets that would significantly affect page rendering to be crawled: for example, CSS and JavaScript files that affect the understanding of the pages. The Google indexing system renders a web page as the user would see it, including images, CSS, and JavaScript files. To see which page assets that Googlebot cannot crawl use the URL Inspection tool; to debug directives in your robots.txt file, use the robots.txt Tester tool.
    Allow search bots to crawl your site without session IDs or URL parameters that track their path through the site. These techniques are useful for tracking individual user behavior, but the access pattern of bots is entirely different. Using these techniques may result in incomplete indexing of your site, as bots may not be able to eliminate URLs that look different but actually point to the same page.
    Make your site’s important content visible by default. Google is able to crawl HTML content hidden inside navigational elements such as tabs or expanding sections, however we consider this content less accessible to users, and believe that you should make your most important information visible in the default page view.
    Make a reasonable effort to ensure that advertisement links on your pages do not affect search engine rankings. For example, use robots.txt, rel="nofollow", or rel="sponsored" to prevent advertisement links from being followed by a crawler.

    Help visitors use your pages

    Try to use text instead of images to display important names, content, or links. If you must use images for textual content, use the alt attribute to include a few words of descriptive text.
    Ensure that all links go to live web pages. Use valid HTML.
    Optimize your page loading times. Fast sites make users happy and improve the overall quality of the web (especially for those users with slow Internet connections). Google recommends that you use tools like PageSpeed Insights and Webpagetest.org to test the performance of your page.
    Design your site for all device types and sizes, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones. Use the Mobile-Friendly Test to test how well your pages work on mobile devices, and get feedback on what needs to be fixed.
    Ensure that your site appears correctly in different browsers.
    If possible, secure your site’s connections with HTTPS. Encrypting interactions between the user and your website is a good practice for communication on the web.
    Ensure that your pages are useful for readers with visual impairments, for example, by testing usability with a screen-reader.

    Basic principles

    Make pages primarily for users, not for search engines.
    Don’t deceive your users.
    Avoid tricks intended to improve search engine rankings. A good rule of thumb is whether you’d feel comfortable explaining what you’ve done to a website that competes with you, or to a Google employee. Another useful test is to ask, “Does this help my users? Would I do this if search engines didn’t exist?”
    Think about what makes your website unique, valuable, or engaging. Make your website stand out from others in your field.

    Specific guidelines
    Avoid the following techniques:

    Automatically generated content
    Participating in link schemes
    Creating pages with little or no original content
    Cloaking
    Sneaky redirects
    Hidden text or links
    Doorway pages
    Scraped content
    Participating in affiliate programs without adding sufficient value
    Loading pages with irrelevant keywords
    Creating pages with malicious behavior, such as phishing or installing viruses, trojans, or other badware
    Abusing structured data markup
    Sending automated queries to Google

    Follow good practices:

    Monitoring your site for hacking and removing hacked content as soon as it appears
    Preventing and removing user-generated spam on your site

    If your site violates one or more of these guidelines, then Google may take manual action against it. Once you have remedied the problem, you can submit your site for reconsideration.

    Website Launch Checklist:
    Website design checklist
    It’s all too easy to miss (or break) something during the many back-and-forths, client feedback sessions, and other design iterations you go through. That’s why we created the design checklist below will help you go back and check for any design mistakes.
    To start, be sure to check your:

    Spacing: Is spacing consistent across the site (i.e., did you stick to that 8px grid, or let a rogue 18px in there)? Do all elements have enough breathing room?
    Colors: Have you stuck to a consistent, harmonious color palette? Are all instances of the brand blue actually the brand blue?
    Shadows: If you used drop shadows, is the light source consistent for each and every one? Did you use the same blur, opacity, and spread values?
    Typography: Is your font stack logical and consistent (i.e., is there a reason that element is set in a sans)? Are your heading sizes consistent? Have you used proper (not faux) italics and bolding? Do all text links look right? Is all text both legible and readable?
    Imagery: Do any images look blurry, pixelated, or otherwise funky? Are any images broken or crazily heavy in terms of file size? Do all non-decorative images have alt tags?
    Logo: It’s (usually) just another image, but it’s so important it warrants its own step. Is it the latest version? Is it crisp (not blurry or pixelated)?

    Once you’ve made these initial visual checks, you’ll want to ensure that your site’s appearance is consistent and functional on any screen.
    Cross-browser appearance
    Different browsers may render your website in different ways, so it’s important to test your site in different browsers. Take a look at W3’s browser stats to see where you should focus your testing. (Though if you’re working on a redesign, browser-usage stats will be more useful.)
    During this process (and the next, in multi-device testing) you’ll want to make sure your layouts, typography, navigation, and other design elements are displaying properly.
    The elements that tend to vary most across browsers, and therefore are most important to check, are:

    Fonts
    Colors/gradients
    Images
    Logo

    Cross-device appearance



    Make sure your site looks and performs beautifully on any device.
    There have never been more web-capable devices around, and with that comes a staggering array of screen sizes. Done right, your site should perform well on any screen size, but be sure to double check. (You are a perfectionist after all, right?)
    This is also where mobile navigation is crucial. Be sure to test out the user’s ability to navigate around the website on a touchscreen device, and make sure nothing gets lost in device transition.
    In Webflow, we make it easy for you to test the most popular devices and preview your website on almost any size, streamlining the process of cross-device testing all in one place. Of course, nothing replaces real-world testing on a variety of devices as small details may differ on the real device.
    Image optimization
    Images and graphics are an important element of many websites, so you’ll want to make sure they display properly, especially on all those ultra-high-definition devices (like Apple’s Retina screens) out there.
    The rule of thumb is to upload your image at twice the size it’ll display on your site. In some cases, you can upload two images: an actual-size version for lower-res devices, and another that’s twice the size for high-res devices.
    Why? Because the heavier the image, the slower your page will load, and the worse your user experience will be (which also negatively affects SEO, which we’ll cover later on).
    In Webflow, we automatically scale, compress, and optimize images for every device. Learn more about our responsive images feature or check out our more detailed article on image optimization.
    Website functionality testing
    Design and functionality go hand in hand, but I like to isolate the two to make sure the website both looks the way it was designed to and that it performs as intended.
    Integration testing
    This one is super important, and can range from a quick task to a giant one, depending on how many integrations you have. Typically, I’ll create a list of integrations as I add them so I don’t forget later on.
    Some common integrations to test might be:

    Web forms (check that the forms work and that submitted information goes to the right place)
    Autoresponders
    Marketing emails (MailChimp, Constant Contact, HubSpot, drip campaigns, etc.)
    RSS feeds
    Ecommerce
    CRM
    CMS

    Link testing
    This one can be a doozy, simply because most sites have dozens (if not hundreds) of links. More often than not, there’s a link or two that goes nowhere, and it’s important to find them before your end-users do.
    Some of the most important links to check are:

    Top navigation links
    Footer links
    Social media links (Facebook, Twitter, etc.)
    Logo (typically links to the home page)

    Rather than doing all this manually, I’d suggest trying a link crawler like the W3C Link Checker, the Chrome plugin Check My Links, or Screaming Frog (which is excellent for SEO audits, too).
    Content editing



    Give the king its due.
    Content is king, and the testing process should be fit for one. Typically this involves making sure that all content has been updated and approved. I can’t tell you how many websites I’ve found that still have a lorem ipsum paragraph somewhere.
    Now, if you practice content-first design, you should have final content already in place, so you can focus on more fine-toothed-comb review, like proofing for spelling and grammatical errors.
    It’s also important to note here that it’s okay for content to be changed later on. Clients, team members, or you can always adjust text through a CMS. The main goal here is to ensure that your website content isn’t complete gibberish.
    Search engine optimization (SEO)



    Analyzing and optimizing your website after publishing is a never-ending process. And you need to consider semantic site structure from the get-go. But that doesn’t mean you won’t benefit from an SEO review before you hit publish.
    There are multiple things that can be done to optimize your website for search engines.
    1. Use proper semantic structure
    Web crawlers (like Google’s bots) read through your website to get an understanding of your content, so that search engines know to display your website when people search for it. To help them crawl your site, you need to use language they’ll understand.
    Historically, this has meant using the following semantic tags:

    h1–h6 (heading tags)
    p (paragraph tags)
    ul/ol (unordered and ordered Lists)

    You can also go above and beyond with some new HTML5 semantic tags:

    <article>
    <aside>
    <details>
    <figcaption>
    <figure>
    <footer>
    <header>
    <main>
    <mark>
    <nav>
    <section>
    <summary>
    <time>

    These tags are important because they let you identify the content that’s most relevant to users. In short: making it easy for search engines makes it easier for users to find you.
    2. Meta SEO tags
    Aside from on-page structure, you can also help web crawlers understand your site by titling and describing your pages as a whole. We outline a few tips on website SEO on our blog, narrowed down to 2 main considerations below.
    Meta title
    Your page’s meta title translates to the linked text people will see on search engine result pages (SERPs). It also displays on the browser tab when people click through to your page. Some best practices include:

    Define the page’s central topic
    Keep it under 70 characters in length (including spaces)
    Use relevant keywords
    Put important keywords in the front of the title

    Meta description
    The meta description is a short sentence (or two) that describes what your website has to offer. It will (sometimes) show up below your meta title in search results.
    Some best practices include:

    Include keywords that describe the page
    Don’t go over 160 characters
    Write your description for people, not robots. (Google doesn’t use descriptions in web rankings).

    3. Open Graph settings
    Social media has become a key element of SEO, so it’s crucial that you amplify this process by providing effective Open Graph information. Open Graph settings include three pieces of content: title, description, and an image.
    The title and description follow the same rules as their SEO counterparts, but instead of showing up in search results, they appear as the default title and description on social media platforms when shared.
    This is hugely beneficial because it lets you determine what the messaging (and image) will be when others share your website, helping you keep control of your brand.

    Regular Expressions
    description:

    CODEX
    Regular Expressions









    description:
    Regular expressions are patterns used to match character combinations in strings. In JavaScript, regular expressions are also objects. These patterns are used with the exec() and test() methods of RegExp, and with the match(), matchAll(), replace(), replaceAll(), search(), and split() methods of String. This chapter describes JavaScript regular expressions.
    Creating a regular expression
    You construct a regular expression in one of two ways:

    Using a regular expression literal, which consists of a pattern enclosed between slashes, as follows:

    let re = /ab+c/;

    Regular expression literals provide compilation of the regular expression when the script is loaded. If the regular expression remains constant, using this can improve performance.

    2. Or calling the constructor function of the RegExp object, as follows:

    let re = new RegExp('ab+c');


    Using the constructor function provides runtime compilation of the regular expression. Use the constructor function when you know the regular expression pattern will be changing, or you don’t know the pattern and are getting it from another source, such as user input.

    Writing a regular expression pattern
    A regular expression pattern is composed of simple characters, such as /abc/, or a combination of simple and special characters, such as /ab*c/ or /Chapter (\d+)\.\d*/.
    The last example includes parentheses, which are used as a memory device. The match made with this part of the pattern is remembered for later use.
    Using simple patterns
    Simple patterns are constructed of characters for which you want to find a direct match.
    For example, the pattern /abc/ matches character combinations in strings only when the exact sequence "abc" occurs (all characters together and in that order).
    Such a match would succeed in the strings "Hi, do you know your abc's?" and "The latest airplane designs evolved from slabcraft."
    In both cases the match is with the substring "abc".
    There is no match in the string "Grab crab" because while it contains the substring "ab c", it does not contain the exact substring "abc".
    Using special characters
    When the search for a match requires something more than a direct match, such as finding one or more b’s, or finding white space, you can include special characters in the pattern.
    For example, to match a single "a" followed by zero or more "b"s followed by "c", you’d use the pattern /ab*c/:

    the * after "b" means “0 or more occurrences of the preceding item.” In the string "cbbabbbbcdebc", this pattern will match the substring "abbbbc".

    Assertions : Assertions include boundaries, which indicate the beginnings and endings of lines and words, and other patterns indicating in some way that a match is possible (including look-ahead, look-behind, and conditional expressions).
    Character classes : Distinguish different types of characters. For example, distinguishing between letters and digits.
    Groups and ranges : Indicate groups and ranges of expression characters.
    Quantifiers : Indicate numbers of characters or expressions to match.
    Unicode property escapes : Distinguish based on unicode character properties, for example, upper- and lower-case letters, math symbols, and punctuation.
    If you want to look at all the special characters that can be used in regular expressions in a single table, see the following:



    Special characters in regular expressions.
    Escaping
    If you need to use any of the special characters literally (actually searching for a "*", for instance), you must escape it by putting a backslash in front of it.
    For instance, to search for "a" followed by "*" followed by "b",

    you’d use /a\*b/ — the backslash “escapes” the "*", making it literal instead of special.

    Similarly, if you’re writing a regular expression literal and need to match a slash (“/”), you need to escape that (otherwise, it terminates the pattern)
    For instance, to search for the string “/example/” followed by one or more alphabetic characters, you’d use /\/example\/[a-z]+/i
    –the backslashes before each slash make them literal.
    To match a literal backslash, you need to escape the backslash.
    For instance, to match the string “C:\” where “C” can be any letter,
    you’d use /[A-Z]:\\/
    — the first backslash escapes the one after it, so the expression searches for a single literal backslash.
    If using the RegExp constructor with a string literal, remember that the backslash is an escape in string literals, so to use it in the regular expression, you need to escape it at the string literal level.
    /a\*b/ and new RegExp("a\\*b") create the same expression,
    which searches for “a” followed by a literal “*” followed by “b”.
    If escape strings are not already part of your pattern you can add them using String.replace:
    function escapeRegExp(string) {
      return string.replace(/[.*+\-?^${}()|[\]\\]/g, '\\$&'); // $& means the whole matched string
    }
    The “g” after the regular expression is an option or flag that performs a global search, looking in the whole string and returning all matches.
    Using parentheses
    Parentheses around any part of the regular expression pattern causes that part of the matched substring to be remembered.
    Once remembered, the substring can be recalled for other use.
    Using regular expressions in JavaScript
    Regular expressions are used with the RegExp methods
    test() and exec()
    and with the String methods match(), replace(), search(), and split().

    Method Descriptions
    exec()
    Executes a search for a match in a string.
    It returns an array of information or null on a mismatch.
    test()
    Tests for a match in a string.
    It returns true or false.
    match()
    Returns an array containing all of the matches, including capturing groups, or null if no match is found.
    matchAll()
    Returns an iterator containing all of the matches, including capturing groups.
    search()
    Tests for a match in a string.
    It returns the index of the match, or -1 if the search fails.
    replace()
    Executes a search for a match in a string, and replaces the matched substring with a replacement substring.
    replaceAll()
    Executes a search for all matches in a string, and replaces the matched substrings with a replacement substring.
    split()
    Uses a regular expression or a fixed string to break a string into an array of substrings.
    Methods that use regular expressions
    When you want to know whether a pattern is found in a string, use the test() or search() methods;
    for more information (but slower execution) use the exec() or match() methods.
    If you use exec() or match() and if the match succeeds, these methods return an array and update properties of the associated regular expression object and also of the predefined regular expression object, RegExp.
    If the match fails, the exec() method returns null (which coerces to false).
    In the following example, the script uses the exec() method to find a match in a string.
    let myRe = /d(b+)d/g;
    let myArray = myRe.exec('cdbbdbsbz');
    If you do not need to access the properties of the regular expression, an alternative way of creating myArray is with this script:
    let myArray = /d(b+)d/g.exec('cdbbdbsbz'); 
        // similar to "cdbbdbsbz".match(/d(b+)d/g); however,
        // "cdbbdbsbz".match(/d(b+)d/g) outputs Array [ "dbbd" ], while 
        // /d(b+)d/g.exec('cdbbdbsbz') outputs Array [ 'dbbd', 'bb', index: 1, input: 'cdbbdbsbz' ].
    (See different behaviors for further info about the different behaviors.)
    If you want to construct the regular expression from a string, yet another alternative is this script:
    let myRe = new RegExp('d(b+)d', 'g');
    let myArray = myRe.exec('cdbbdbsbz');
    With these scripts, the match succeeds and returns the array and updates the properties shown in the following table.
    Results of regular expression execution.
    You can use a regular expression created with an object initializer without assigning it to a letiable.
    If you do, however, every occurrence is a new regular expression.
    For this reason, if you use this form without assigning it to a letiable, you cannot subsequently access the properties of that regular expression.
    For example, assume you have this script:
    let myRe = /d(b+)d/g;
    let myArray = myRe.exec('cdbbdbsbz');
    console.log('The value of lastIndex is ' + myRe.lastIndex);
    // "The value of lastIndex is 5"
    However, if you have this script:
    let myArray = /d(b+)d/g.exec('cdbbdbsbz');
    console.log('The value of lastIndex is ' + /d(b+)d/g.lastIndex);
    // "The value of lastIndex is 0"
    The occurrences of /d(b+)d/g in the two statements are different regular expression objects and hence have different values for their lastIndex property.
    If you need to access the properties of a regular expression created with an object initializer, you should first assign it to a variable.
    [Advanced searching with flags]
    Regular expressions have six optional flags that allow for functionality like global and case insensitive searching.
    These flags can be used separately or together in any order, and are included as part of the regular expression.
    Flag Description Corresponding property

    g Global search. RegExp.prototype.global
    i Case-insensitive search. RegExp.prototype.ignoreCase
    m Multi-line search. RegExp.prototype.multiline
    s Allows . to match newline characters. RegExp.prototype.dotAll
    u “unicode”; treat a pattern as a sequence of unicode code points. RegExp.prototype.unicode
    y Perform a “sticky” search that matches starting at the current position in the target string. RegExp.prototype.sticky
    Regular expression flags
    To include a flag with the regular expression, use this syntax:
    let re = /pattern/flags;
    or
    let re = new RegExp('pattern', 'flags');
    Note that the flags are an integral part of a regular expression. They cannot be added or removed later.
    For example, re = /\w+\s/g creates a regular expression that looks for one or more characters followed by a space, and it looks for this combination throughout the string.
    let re = /\w+\s/g;
    let str = 'fee fi fo fum';
    let myArray = str.match(re);
    console.log(myArray);
    // ["fee ", "fi ", "fo "]
    You could replace the line:
    let re = /\w+\s/g;
    with:
    let re = new RegExp('\\w+\\s', 'g');
    and get the same result.
    The behavior associated with the g flag is different when the .exec() method is used.
    The roles of “class” and “argument” get reversed:
    In the case of .match(), the string class (or data type) owns the method and the regular expression is just an argument,
    while in the case of .exec(), it is the regular expression that owns the method, with the string being the argument.
    Contrast this str.match(re) versus re.exec(str).
    The g flag is used with the .exec() method to get iterative progression.
    let xArray; while(xArray = re.exec(str)) console.log(xArray);
    // produces: 
    // ["fee ", index: 0, input: "fee fi fo fum"]
    // ["fi ", index: 4, input: "fee fi fo fum"]
    // ["fo ", index: 7, input: "fee fi fo fum"]
    The m flag is used to specify that a multiline input string should be treated as multiple lines.
    If the m flag is used, ^ and $ match at the start or end of any line within the input string instead of the start or end of the entire string.
    Using special characters to verify input
    In the following example, the user is expected to enter a phone number. When the user presses the “Check” button, the script checks the validity of the number. If the number is valid (matches the character sequence specified by the regular expression), the script shows a message thanking the user and confirming the number. If the number is invalid, the script informs the user that the phone number is not valid.
    Within non-capturing parentheses (?: , the regular expression looks for three numeric characters \d{3} OR | a left parenthesis \( followed by three digits\d{3}, followed by a close parenthesis \), (end non-capturing parenthesis )), followed by one dash, forward slash, or decimal point and when found, remember the character ([-\/\.]), followed by three digits \d{3}, followed by the remembered match of a dash, forward slash, or decimal point \1, followed by four digits \d{4}.
    The Change event activated when the user presses Enter sets the value of RegExp.input.
    HTML
    <p>
      Enter your phone number (with area code) and then click "Check".
      <br>
      The expected format is like ###-###-####.
    </p>
    <form action="#">
      <input id="phone">
        <button onclick="testInfo(document.getElementById('phone'));">Check</button>
    </form>
    JavaScript
    let re = /(?:\d{3}|\(\d{3}\))([-\/\.])\d{3}\1\d{4}/;
    function testInfo(phoneInput) {
      let OK = re.exec(phoneInput.value);
      if (!OK) {
        console.error(phoneInput.value + ' isn\'t a phone number with area code!'); 
      } else {
        console.log('Thanks, your phone number is ' + OK[0]);}
    }

    Scheduling: setTimeout and setInterval
    We may decide to execute a function not right now, but at a later time. That’s called “scheduling a call”.

    Scheduling: setTimeout and setInterval
    We may decide to execute a function not right now, but at a later time. That’s called “scheduling a call”.



    There are two methods for it:

    setTimeout allows us to run a function once after the interval of time.
    setInterval allows us to run a function repeatedly, starting after the interval of time, then repeating continuously at that interval.

    These methods are not a part of JavaScript specification. But most environments have an internal scheduler and provide these methods. In particular, they are supported in all browsers and Node.js.
    setTimeout
    The syntax:
    let timerId = setTimeout(func|code, [delay], [arg1], [arg2], ...)
    Parameters:
    func|code: Function or a string of code to execute.
    Usually, that’s a function. For historical reasons, a string of code can be passed, but that’s not recommended.
    delay: The delay before running, in milliseconds (1000 ms = 1 second), by default 0.
    arg1, arg2: Arguments for the function (not supported in IE9-)
    For instance, this code calls sayHi() after one second:
    function sayHi() {
      alert('Hello');
    }
    !
    setTimeout(sayHi, 1000);
    /!
    With arguments:
    function sayHi(phrase, who) {
      alert( phrase + ', ' + who );
    }
    !
    setTimeout(sayHi, 1000, "Hello", "John"); // Hello, John
    /!
    If the first argument is a string, then JavaScript creates a function from it.
    So, this will also work:
    setTimeout("alert('Hello')", 1000);
    But using strings is not recommended, use arrow functions instead of them, like this:
    setTimeout(() => alert('Hello'), 1000);
    Novice developers sometimes make a mistake by adding brackets () after the function:
    // wrong!
    setTimeout(sayHi(), 1000);
    That doesn't work, because setTimeout expects a reference to a function. And here sayHi() runs the function, and the result of its execution is passed to setTimeout. In our case the result of sayHi() is undefined (the function returns nothing), so nothing is scheduled.
    Canceling with clearTimeout
    A call to setTimeout returns a “timer identifier” timerId that we can use to cancel the execution.
    The syntax to cancel:
    let timerId = setTimeout(...);
    clearTimeout(timerId);
    In the code below, we schedule the function and then cancel it (changed our mind). As a result, nothing happens:
    let timerId = setTimeout(() => alert("never happens"), 1000);
    alert(timerId); // timer identifier
    clearTimeout(timerId);
    alert(timerId); // same identifier (doesn't become null after canceling)
    As we can see from alert output, in a browser the timer identifier is a number. In other environments, this can be something else. For instance, Node.js returns a timer object with additional methods.
    Again, there is no universal specification for these methods, so that’s fine.
    For browsers, timers are described in the timers section of HTML5 standard.
    setInterval
    The setInterval method has the same syntax as setTimeout:
    let timerId = setInterval(func|code, [delay], [arg1], [arg2], ...)
    All arguments have the same meaning. But unlike setTimeout it runs the function not only once, but regularly after the given interval of time.
    To stop further calls, we should call clearInterval(timerId).
    The following example will show the message every 2 seconds. After 5 seconds, the output is stopped:
    // repeat with the interval of 2 seconds
    let timerId = setInterval(() => alert('tick'), 2000);
    // after 5 seconds stop
    setTimeout(() => { clearInterval(timerId); alert('stop'); }, 5000);
    ```smart header = “Time goes on while alert is shown”
    In most browsers, including Chrome and Firefox, the internal timer continues “ticking” while showing alert/confirm/prompt.
    So if you run the code above and don’t dismiss the alert window for some time, then the next alert will be shown immediately as you do it. The actual interval between alerts will be shorter than 2 seconds.
    ##  Nested setTimeout
    <p class="mume-header " id="nested-settimeout"></p>
    There are two ways of running something regularly.
    One is setInterval. The other one is a nested setTimeout, like this:
    /** instead of:
    let timerId = setInterval(() =&gt; alert(&#39;tick&#39;), 2000);
    */

    let timerId = setTimeout(function tick() {
      alert(&#39;tick&#39;);
    *!*
      timerId = setTimeout(tick, 2000); // (*)
    */!*
    }, 2000);</code></pre>
    <p>The <code>setTimeout</code> above schedules the next call right at the end of the current one <code>(*)</code>.</p>
    <p>The nested <code>setTimeout</code> is a more flexible method than <code>setInterval</code>. This way the next call may be scheduled differently, depending on the results of the current one.</p>
    <p>For instance, we need to write a service that sends a request to the server every 5 seconds asking for data, but in case the server is overloaded, it should increase the interval to 10, 20, 40 seconds…</p>
    <p>Here’s the pseudocode:</p>
    <pre><code>let delay = 5000;

    let timerId = setTimeout(function request() {
      ...send request...

      if (request failed due to server overload) {
        // increase the interval to the next run
        delay *= 2;
      }

      timerId = setTimeout(request, delay);

    }, delay);</code></pre>
    <p>And if the functions that we’re scheduling are CPU-hungry, then we can measure the time taken by the execution and plan the next call sooner or later.</p>
    <p><strong>Nested</strong> <code>setTimeout</code> <strong>allows to set the delay between the executions more precisely than</strong> <code>setInterval</code><strong>.</strong></p>
    <p>Let’s compare two code fragments. The first one uses <code>setInterval</code>:</p>
    <pre><code>let i = 1;
    setInterval(function() {
      func(i++);
    }, 100);</code></pre>
    <p>The second one uses nested <code>setTimeout</code>:</p>
    <pre><code>let i = 1;
    setTimeout(function run() {
      func(i++);
      setTimeout(run, 100);
    }, 100);</code></pre>
    <p>For <code>setInterval</code> the internal scheduler will run <code>func(i++)</code> every 100ms:</p>
    <p>Did you notice?</p>
    <p><strong>The real delay between</strong> <code>func</code> <strong>calls for</strong> <code>setInterval</code> <strong>is less than in the code!</strong></p>
    <p>That’s normal, because the time taken by <code>func</code>’s execution “consumes” a part of the interval.</p>
    <p>It is possible that <code>func</code>’s execution turns out to be longer than we expected and takes more than 100ms.</p>
    <p>In this case the engine waits for <code>func</code> to complete, then checks the scheduler and if the time is up, runs it again <em>immediately</em>.</p>
    <p>In the edge case, if the function always executes longer than <code>delay</code> ms, then the calls will happen without a pause at all.</p>
    <p>And here is the picture for the nested <code>setTimeout</code>:</p>
    <p><strong>The nested</strong> <code>setTimeout</code> <strong>guarantees the fixed delay (here 100ms).</strong></p>
    <p>That’s because a new call is planned at the end of the previous one.</p>
    <pre><code>When a function is passed in `setInterval/setTimeout`, an internal reference is created to it and saved in the scheduler. It prevents the function from being garbage collected, even if there are no other references to it.

    ```js
    // the function stays in memory until the scheduler calls it
    setTimeout(function() {...}, 100);
    For setInterval the function stays in memory until clearInterval is called.
    There's a side-effect. A function references the outer lexical environment, so, while it lives, outer variables live too. They may take much more memory than the function itself. So when we don't need the scheduled function anymore, it's better to cancel it, even if it's very small.
    Zero delay setTimeout
    There’s a special use case: setTimeout(func, 0), or just setTimeout(func).
    This schedules the execution of func as soon as possible. But the scheduler will invoke it only after the currently executing script is complete.
    So the function is scheduled to run “right after” the current script.
    For instance, this outputs “Hello”, then immediately “World”:
    setTimeout(() => alert("World"));
    alert("Hello");
    The first line “puts the call into calendar after 0ms”. But the scheduler will only “check the calendar” after the current script is complete, so "Hello" is first, and "World" – after it.
    There are also advanced browser-related use cases of a zero-delay timeout, that we’ll discuss in the chapter info:event-loop.
    In the browser, there's a limitation of how often nested timers can run. The [HTML5 standard](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/timers-and-user-prompts.html#timers) says: "after five nested timers, the interval is forced to be at least 4 milliseconds.".
    Let's demonstrate what it means with the example below. The setTimeout call in it re-schedules itself with zero delay. Each call remembers the real time from the previous one in the times array. What do the real delays look like? Let's see:
    let start = Date.now();
    let times = [];

    setTimeout(function run() {
      times.push(Date.now() - start); // remember delay from the previous call

      if (start + 100 &lt; Date.now()) alert(times); // show the delays after 100ms
      else setTimeout(run); // else re-schedule
    });

    // an example of the output:
    // 1,1,1,1,9,15,20,24,30,35,40,45,50,55,59,64,70,75,80,85,90,95,100
    First timers run immediately (just as written in the spec), and then we see 9, 15, 20, 24.... The 4+ ms obligatory delay between invocations comes into play.
    The similar thing happens if we use setInterval instead of setTimeout: setInterval(f) runs f few times with zero-delay, and afterwards with 4+ ms delay.
    That limitation comes from ancient times and many scripts rely on it, so it exists for historical reasons.
    For server-side JavaScript, that limitation does not exist, and there exist other ways to schedule an immediate asynchronous job, like setImmediate for Node.js. So this note is browser-specific.
    Summary

    Methods setTimeout(func, delay, ...args) and setInterval(func, delay, ...args) allow us to run the func once/regularly after delay milliseconds.
    To cancel the execution, we should call clearTimeout/clearInterval with the value returned by setTimeout/setInterval.
    Nested setTimeout calls are a more flexible alternative to setInterval, allowing us to set the time between executions more precisely.
    Zero delay scheduling with setTimeout(func, 0) (the same as setTimeout(func)) is used to schedule the call “as soon as possible, but after the current script is complete”.
    The browser limits the minimal delay for five or more nested calls of setTimeout or for setInterval (after 5th call) to 4ms. That’s for historical reasons.

    Please note that all scheduling methods do not guarantee the exact delay.
    For example, the in-browser timer may slow down for a lot of reasons:

    The CPU is overloaded.
    The browser tab is in the background mode.
    The laptop is on battery.

    All that may increase the minimal timer resolution (the minimal delay) to 300ms or even 1000ms depending on the browser and OS-level performance settings.

    Super Simple Intro To HTML
    What is HTML, CSS & JS and why do we need all three?



    HTML stands for “Hypertext Markup Language”. Basically, HTML is the structure for the website, words, bullet points, data tables, etc. CSS stands for “Cascading Style Sheets” which means it’s the “Style” it’s how to make your website look professional, and look visually appealing. JS is how to make your website actually **work**.
    For example, if you created something like YouTube and one of the options you can watch videos, you used HTML for the title, you used CSS for the color/s, and you have to make it actually work! So when you click on it it will run the video. This is an example of the three programming languages working in unison to form an experience you’re already familiar with if you’re reading this…
    I mean most likely… unless you printed it because you hate trees.
    — — — — — — — — — — -
    What are Tags and Attributes?
    Tags and attributes are the basis of HTML.
    They work together but perform different functions — it is worth investing 2 minutes in differentiating the two.
    What Are HTML Tags?
    Tags are used to mark up the start of an HTML element and they are usually enclosed in angle brackets. An example of a tag is: <h1>.
    Most tags must be opened <h1> and closed </h1> in order to function.
    What are HTML Attributes?
    Attributes contain additional pieces of information. Attributes take the form of an opening tag and additional info is placed inside.
    An example of an attribute is:
    <img src="mydog.jpg" alt="A photo of my dog.">
    In this instance, the image source (src) and the alt text (alt) are attributes of the <img> tag.
    Golden Rules To Remember

    The vast majority of tags must be opened (<tag>) and closed (</tag>) with the element information such as a title or text resting between the tags.
    When using multiple tags, the tags must be closed in the order in which they were opened. For example:
    <strong><em>This is really important!</em></strong>

    Let’s have a look at how CodePen works, firstly, you need to go to their website. After that, you must create an account. After you do that, You will see something like this
    How to get started
    If you’re using Visual Studio Code, congrats! There is Emmet support built into VSCode, so you won’t need to install any extensions. If you’re working in Atom you’ll need to install the Emmet plugin, which can be found here.
    Basic Syntax
    HTML Boilerplate
    If you’ve been working in VSCode, you’ve probably seen Emmet syntax highlighting when working in HTML documents. In my opinion, the most convenient Emmet shortcut is html:5. This will create an HTML boilerplate, and fill out metadata tags in the head of your document.
    html:5



    Emmet Abbreviation for different HTML boilerplates.
    When you see the auto complete as pictured above you can hit tab to auto fill the boilerplate html document.
    That one small shortcut autogenerates all this metadata and head and body tags:



    Here’s some slightly more advanced boilerplate for you to use as a starting point in your projects.
    HTML Language
    Chapter 1: Formatting text
    Tags in HTML: Tags are one of the most important parts in an HTML document. (We will get to what HTML document is after we know what tags are). HTML uses some predefined tags which tells the browser about content display property, that is how to display a particular given content. For Example, to create a paragraph, one must use the paragraph tags(<p> </p>) and to insert an image one must use the img tags(<img />).
    There are generally two types of tags in HTML:

    Paired tags: These tags come in pairs. That is they have both opening (< >) and closing(</ >) tags.
    Singular tags: These tags do not required to be closed


    i.e.

    <hr> 
    <p> The tag above me is a horizontal line that doesn't need a closing tag </p>
    HTML tags have two main types: block-level and inline tags.

    Block-level elements take up the full available space and always start a new line in the document. Headings and paragraphs are a great example of block tags.
    Inline elements only take up as much space as they need and don’t start a new line on the page. They usually serve to format the inner contents of block-level elements. Links and emphasized strings are good examples of inline tags.

    Block-Level Tags
    The three block level tags every HTML document needs to contain are <html>, <head>, and <body>.

    The <html></html> tag is the highest level element that encloses every HTML page.
    The <head></head> tag holds meta information such as the page’s title and charset.
    Finally, the <body></body> tag encloses all the content that appears on the page.


    Paragraphs are enclosed by <p></p>, while blockquotes use the <blockquote></blockquote> tag.
    Divisions are bigger content sections that typically contain several paragraphs, images, sometimes blockquotes, and other smaller elements. We can mark them up using the <div></div> tag. A div element can contain another div tag inside it as well.
    You may also use <ol></ol> tags for ordered lists and <ul></ul> for unordered ones. Individual list items must be enclosed by the <li></li> tag. For example, this is how a basic unordered list looks like in HTML:


    <ul>
    <li>List item 1</li>
    <li>List item 2</li>
    <li>List item 3</li>
    </ul>

    Structure of an HTML Document
    An HTML Document is mainly divided into two parts:

    HEAD: This contains the information about the HTML document. For Example, Title of the page, version of HTML, Meta-Data etc.

    HTML TAG Specifies an html document. The HTML element (or HTML root element) represents the root of an HTML document. All other elements must be descendants of this element. Since the element is the first in a document, it is called the root element.
    Although this tag can be implied, or not required, with HTML, it is required to be opened and closed in XHTML.

    Divisions are bigger content sections that typically contain several paragraphs, images, sometimes blockquotes, and other smaller elements. We can mark them up using the <div></div> tag. A div element can contain another div tag inside it as well.
    You may also use <ol></ol> tags for ordered lists and <ul></ul> for unordered ones. Individual list items must be enclosed by the <li></li> tag. For example, this is how a basic unordered list looks like in HTML:


    <ul>
    <li>List item 1</li>
    <li>List item 2</li>
    <li>List item 3</li>
    </ul>

    Inline Tags
    Many inline tags are used to format text. For example, a <strong></strong> tag would render an element in bold, whereas <em></em> tags would show it in italics.
    Hyperlinks are also inline elements that require <a></a> tags and href attributes to indicate the link’s destination:

    <a href=”https://example.com/">Click me!</a>

    Images are inline elements too. You can add one using <img> without any closing tag. But you will also need to use the src attribute to specify the image path, for example:

    <img src=”/images/example.jpg” alt=”Example image”>

    BODY: This contains everything you want to display on the Web Page.
    <body>
    <! — Everything the user sees on the webpage goes here! — ps… this is a comment →
    </body>
    Let us now have a look on the basic structure of HTML. That is the code which is must for every webpage to have:
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    Here is some boilerplate html you can use as a starting point:!!Every Webpage must contain this code.!!

    <!DOCTYPE html>

    Below is the complete explanation of each of the tags used in the above piece of HTML code:
    <!DOCTYPE html>: This tag is used to tells the HTML version. This currently tells that the version is HTML 5.

    <html>: This is called HTML root element and used to wrap all the code.


    <head>: Head tag contains metadata, title, page CSS etc. All the HTML elements that can be used inside the <head> element are:


    <body>: Body tag is used to enclosed all the data which a web page has from texts to links. All of the content that you see rendered in the browser is contained within this element.

    Bold Text:
    <b> this is bold </b>
    <strong> ⇐ this is for strong, emergency emotions.
    ___________
    HEADING/S:
    6 types from largest(h1) to smallest (h6)
    <h1> <h2> <h3> <h4> <h5> <h6>
    ___________
    ITALICS: There are two ways to use it, the first one is the <i> tag and the second one is the <em> tag. They both italicize the text🤷
    <i> this is fancy text that’s too good to for us</i>
    ___________
    PARAGRAPHS: In order to make Paragraphs, just add <p>.
    <p> Hi there my name is Jason. </p>
    ___________
    TITLES: not the same thing as a heading (which renders on the html page) but instead the title element represents the title of the page as shown in the tab of the browser.
    <head>
    As such <title>This is the title</title> it is always found between <head> tags and not in the body of the page where all the content that gets rendered on the page is contained.



    Here’s a handy Cheat Sheet:



    Below I am going to Include a gist that contains html code that uses pretty much every tag I could think of off the top of my head…
    If it’s not included here I promise you it’s seldom used by most webpages.
    Below that I will embed an image of the webpage that it renders too….
    that super small text at the bottom is actually one giant button:

    Part 1

    The Beginner’s Guide To JavaScript
    Part 1



    How to learn effectively
    Learning: The acquisition of skills and the ability to apply them in the future.
    What makes an Effective learner?

    They are active listeners.
    They are engaged with the material.
    They are receptive of feedback.
    They are open to difficulty.

    Why do active learning techniques feel difficult?

    It feels difficult because you are constantly receiving feedback, and so you are constantly adapting and perfecting the material.

    Desirable Difficulty

    The skills we wish to obtain is often a difficult one.
    We want challenging but possible lessons based on current level of skill.

    Effective learners space their practice

    Consistent effort > cramming => for durable knowledge


    Here’s a REPL to practice with:
    lambda-prep pre-course-workreplit.com

    INTRO@JSWEB Resource-sharing-hublambda-prep.netlify.app

    Hello World

    console.log : command used to print something onto the screen.
    syntax : the exact arrangement of the symbols, characters, and keywords in our code.
    // : notation for creating a code comment in JS.
    code comment : useful for annotating pieces of code to explain how something works, ignored by computer.


    “Simplicity is prerequisite for reliability.” — Edsger W. Dijkstra


    The Number Data Type
    The number data type in JS is used to represent any numerical values, including integers and decimal numbers.
    Basic Arithmetic Operators
    Operators are the symbols that perform particular operations.

    + (addition)
    - (subtraction)
    asterisk (multiplication)
    / (division)
    % (modulo)

    JS evaluates more complex expressions using the general math order of operations aka PEMDAS.

    PEMDAS : Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Modulo, Addition, Subtraction.
    To force a specific order of operation, use the group operator ( ) around a part of the expression.

    Modulo : Very useful operation to check divisibility of numbers, check for even & odd, whether a number is prime, and much more! (Discrete Math concept, circular problems can be solved with modulo)

    Whenever you have a smaller number % a larger number, the answer will just be the initial small number.
    console.log(7 % 10); // => 7;


    The String Data Type
    The string data type is a primitive data type that used to represent textual data.

    can be wrapped by either single or double quotation marks, best to choose one and stick with it for consistency.
    If your string contains quotation marks inside, can layer single or double quotation marks to allow it to work.
    "That's a great string"; (valid)
    'Shakespeare wrote, "To be or not to be"'; (valid)
    'That's a bad string'; (invalid)
    Alt. way to add other quotes within strings is to use template literals.
    `This is a temp'l'ate literal ${function}` // use ${} to invoke functions within.
    .length : property that can be appended to data to return the length.
    empty strings have a length of zero.
    indices : indexes of data that begin at 0, can call upon index by using the bracket notation [ ].

    console.log("bootcamp"[0]); // => "b"
    console.log("bootcamp"[10]); // => "undefined"
    console.log("boots"[1 * 2]); // => "o"
    console.log("boots"["boot".length - 1]); // => "t"

    we can pass expressions through the brackets as well since JS always evaluates expressions first.
    The index of the last character of a string is always one less than it’s length.
    indexOf() : method used to find the first index of a given character within a string.
    console.log("bagel".indexOf("b")); // => 0 console.log("bagel".indexOf("z")); // => -1
    if the character inside the indexOf() search does not exist in the string, the output will be -1.
    the indexOf() search will return the first instanced index of the the char in the string.
    concatenate : word to describe joining strings together into a single string.


    The Boolean Data Type
    The boolean data type is the simplest data type since there are only two values: true and false.

    Logical Operators (Boolean Operators) are used to establish logic in our code.
    ! (not) : reverses a boolean value.
    console.log(!true); // => false console.log(!!false); // => false
    && (and) Truth Table





    Logical Order of Operations : JS will evaluate !, then &&, then ||.
    De Morgan’s Law : Common mistake in boolean logic is incorrectly distributing ! across parentheses.
    !(A || B) === !A && !B; !(A && B) === !A || !B;
    In summary, to correctly distribute ! across parentheses we must also flip the operation within.
    Short-Circuit Evaluation : Because JS evalutes from left to right, expressions can “short-circuit”. For example if we have true on the left of an || logical comparison, it will stop evaluating and yield true instead of wasting resources on processing the rest of the statement.
    console.log(true || !false); // => stops after it sees "true ||"


    Comparison Operators
    All comparison operators will result in a boolean output.
    The relative comparators

    > (greater than)
    < (less than)
    >= (greater than or equal to)
    <= (less than or equal to)
    === (equal to)
    !== (not equal to)


    Fun Fact: “a” < “b” is considered valid JS Code because string comparisons are compared lexicographically (meaning dictionary order), so “a” is less than “b” because it appears earlier!


    If there is ever a standstill comparison of two string lexicographically (i.e. app vs apple) the comparison will deem the shorter string lesser.

    Difference between == and ===

    === : Strict Equality, will only return true if the two comparisons are entirely the same.
    == : Loose Equality, will return true even if the values are of a different type, due to coercion. (Avoid using this)


    Variables
    Variables are used to store information to be referenced and manipulated in a program.

    We initialize a variable by using the let keyword and a = single equals sign (assignment operator).
    let bootcamp = "Lambda"; console.log(bootcamp); // "Lambda"
    JS variable names can contain any alphanumeric characters, underscores, or dollar signs (cannot being with a number).
    If you do not declare a value for a variable, undefined is automatically set.
    let bootcamp; console.log(bootcamp); // undefined
    We can change the value of a previously declared variable (let, not const) by re-assigning it another value.
    let is the updated version of var; there are some differences in terms of hoisting and global/block scope — will be covered later in the course (common interview question!)

    Assignment Shorthand
    let num = 0;
    num += 10; // same as num = num + 10
    num -= 2; // same as num = num - 2
    num /= 4; // same as num = num / 4
    num *= 7; // same as num = num * 7

    In general, any nonsensical arithmetic will result in NaN ; usually operations that include undefined.
    declaration : process of simply introducing a variable name.
    initialization : process of both declaring and assigning a variable on the same line.


    Functions
    A function is a procedure of code that will run when called. Functions are used so that we do not have to rewrite code to do the same thing over and over. (Think of them as ‘subprograms’)

    Function Declaration : Process when we first initially write our function.
    Includes three things:
    Name of the function.
    A list of parameters ()
    The code to execute {}
    Function Calls : We can call upon our function whenever and wherever* we want. (*wherever is only after the initial declaration)
    JS evaluates code top down, left to right.
    When we execute a declared function later on in our program we refer to this as invoking our function.
    Every function in JS returns undefined unless otherwise specified.
    When we hit a return statement in a function we immediately exit the function and return to where we called the function.
    When naming functions in JS always use camelCase and name it something appropriate. > Greate code reads like English and almost explains itself. Think: Elegant, readable, and maintainable!


    Parameters and Arguments

    Parameters : Comma seperated variables specified as part of a function’s declaration.
    Arguments : Values passed to the function when it is invoked.
    If the number of arguments passed during a function invocation is different than the number of parameters listed, it will still work.
    However, is there are not enough arguments provided for parameters our function will likely yield Nan.

    The Best Cloud-Based Code Playgrounds of 2021 (Part 1)
    A plethora of front-end code playgrounds have appeared over the years. They offer a convenient way to experiment with client-side code and teach/share with others without the hassle of configuring a development environment.




    Typical features of these online playgrounds include:

    color-coded HTML, CSS and JavaScript editors
    a preview window — many update on the fly without a refresh
    HTML pre-processors such as HAML
    LESS, SASS and Stylus CSS pre-processing
    inclusion of popular JavaScript libraries
    developer consoles and code validation tools
    sharing via a short URL
    embedding demonstrations in other pages
    code forking
    zero cost (or payment for premium services only)
    showing off your coding skills to the world!


    The following list is in no particular order and which playground you use is a matter of application and personal taste, they each have their own specialities.

    1.) REPL.IT
    My personal favorite for it’s simplicity, versatility and capabilities.
    ⚫No downloads, no configs, no setups
    In your browser. Repl.it runs fully in your browser, so you can get started coding in seconds. No more ZIPs, PKGs, DMGs and WTFs.

    Any OS, any device(I’m looking at you chromebook coders). You can use Repl.it on macOS, Windows, Linux, or any other OS .

    ⚫Clone, commit and push to any GitHub repo.
    Repl from Repo. Get started with any Github repo, right from your browser. Commit and push without touching your terminal.
    ⚫Markdown Preview
    >A new but fundamentally important feature
    ⚫No-setup Unit Testing
    >Unit testing is a powerful way to verify that code works as intended and creates a quick feedback loop for development & learning. However, setting up a reproducible unit-testing environment is a time-consuming and delicate affair. Repl.it now features zero-setup unit testing!
    ⚫HTTPS by default
    In the example below I have 72 solved Javascript Leetcode Problems but REPL.IT can handle almost any language you can think of.
    Here’s another one that contains the Repl.it Docs:

    JS-Fiddle

    jsFiddle is a cloud-based JavaScript code playground that allows web developers to tweak their code and see the results of this tweaking in real time. The editor supports not only JavaScript and its variants but also HTML and CSS code, and it further supports popular JavaScript frameworks, such as jQuery, AngularJS, ReactiveJS and D3. The ad-supported site is also completely free to use.

    ⚫Entering and running code

    JSFiddle has the notion of panels (or tabs if you switch into the tabbed layout), there are 4 panels, 3 where you can enter code, and 1 to see the result.


    HTML — structure code, no need to add body doctype head, that’s added automatically
    CSS — styles. You can switch pre-pocessor to SCSS
    JavaScript — behavior. There are many frameworks and code pre-processors you can use

    Once you enter code, just hit Run in the top actions bar, and the fourth panel with results will appear.
    ⚫Saving and Forking code

    Save / Update will do what you think, it’ll save a new fiddle or update an existing one (and add a version number to it)
    Fork will split out an existing fiddle into a new one, starting with version 0


    StackBlitz
    StackBlitz

    Installs packages ≥5x faster than Yarn & NPM 🔥
    Reduces the size of node_modules up to two orders of magnitude 😮
    Has multiple layers of redundancy for production grade reliability 💪
    Works entirely within your web browser, enabling lightning fast dev environments ⚡️


    Dependencies still slip into the install process as dev & sub-dependencies and are downloaded & extracted all the same, resulting in the infamous black hole known as node_modules:




    Dank, relevant meme (pictured Left)
    This is the crux of what prevents NPM from working natively in-browser. Resolving, downloading, and extracting the hundreds of megabytes (or gigabytes) typical frontend projects contain in their node_modules folder is a challenge browsers just aren’t well suited for. Additionally, this is also why existing server side solutions to this problem have proven to be slow, unreliable



    Then just paste the embed code in an iframe and you’re good to go!



    On StackBlitz.com, you can create new projects and get the embed code from the ‘Share’ dropdown link in the top navigation like so:
    Embed Options

    <iframe src=”https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular?embed=1"></iframe>







    🡩 Alternatively, you can also use StackBlitz’s Javascript SDK methods for easily embedding StackBlitz projects on the page & avoid all the hassles of creating/configuring iframes.
    Here’s a sample project of mine, it’s a medium clone… (So Metta)… feel free to write a post… or don’t …but either way … as you can see… Stack Blitz enables you to write serious web applications in a fraction of the time it would take with a conventional setup.

    Glitch
    ⚫Glitch ** provides two project templates that you can use to start creating your app:**

    Classic Website
    Node.js

    If you know the type of project that you would like to create, click here to get started! Or keep reading to learn more about the Classic Website and Node.js templates.
    ⚫Classic Website



    The Classic Website template is your starting point for creating a static website that includes an index.html page and static HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Just start typing and your work will be live on the internet! Static websites enjoy unlimited uptime too! This means that your website stays on 24/7 without using your Project Hours.
    An existing project will be identified by Glitch as a static site if it does not contain one of the following files:

    package.json
    requirements.txt
    glitch.json

    ⚫Node.js



    If you are looking to build a full-stack JavaScript application, choose the Node.js template. This template includes both front-end and back-end code using the popular Express Node.js application framework.
    ⚫Here are some other ways to get started on Glitch…




    Create an app by importing a GitHub repo.
    Build an app that integrates with a popular third-party platform or framework, by remixing one of these starter templates.

    Still not sure where to start? Check out these categories of community-built apps for inspiration:

    Getting visual feedback in your programs
    The first command we’ll learn in JavaScript is console.log. This command is used to print something onto the screen. As we write our first lines of code, we’ll be using console.log frequently as a way to visually see the output of our programs. Let’s write our first program:
    console.log("hello world");
    console.log("how are you?");
    Executing the program above would print out the following:
    hello world
    how are you?
    Nothing too ground breaking here, but pay close attention to the exact way we wrote the program. In particular, notice how we lay out the periods, parentheses, and quotation marks. We’ll also terminate lines with semicolons (;).

    Depending on how you structure your code, sometimes you’ll be able to omit semicolons at the end of lines. For now, you’ll want to include them just as we do.

    Syntax
    We refer to the exact arrangement of the symbols, characters, and keywords as syntax. These details matter — your computer will only be able to “understand” proper JavaScript syntax. A programming language is similar to a spoken language. A spoken language like English has grammar rules that we should follow in order to be understood by fellow speakers. In the same way, a programming language like JavaScript has syntax rules that we ought to follow!
    As you write your first lines of code in this new language, you may make many syntax errors. Don’t get frustrated! This is normal — all new programmers go through this phase. Every time we recognize an error in our code, we have an opportunity to reinforce your understanding of correct syntax. Adopt a growth mindset and learn from your mistakes.
    Additionally, one of the best things about programming is that we can get such immediate feedback from our creations. There is no penalty for making a mistake when programming. Write some code, run the code, read the errors, fix the errors, rinse and repeat!
    Code comments
    Occasionally we’ll want to leave comments or notes in our code. Commented lines will be ignored by our computer. This means that we can use comments to write plain english or temporarily avoid execution of some JavaScript lines. The proper syntax for writing a comment is to begin the line with double forward slashes (//):
    // let's write another program!!!
    console.log("hello world");
    // console.log("how are you?");
    console.log("goodbye moon");
    The program above would only print:
    hello world
    goodbye moon
    Comments are useful when annotating pieces of code to offer an explanation of how the code works. We’ll want to strive to write straightforward code that is self-explanatory when possible, but we can also use comments to add additional clarity. The real art of programming is to write code so elegantly that it is easy to follow.
    The Number Data Type
    The number data type in JS is used to represent any numerical values, including integers and decimal numbers.
    Basic Arithmetic Operators
    Operators are the symbols that perform particular operations.

    + (addition)
    - (subtraction)
    asterisk (multiplication)
    / (division)
    % (modulo)

    JS evaluates more complex expressions using the general math order of operations aka PEMDAS.

    PEMDAS : Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Modulo, Addition, Subtraction.
    To force a specific order of operation, use the group operator ( ) around a part of the expression.

    Modulo : Very useful operation to check divisibility of numbers, check for even & odd, whether a number is prime, and much more! (Discrete Math concept, circular problems can be solved with modulo)

    Whenever you have a smaller number % a larger number, the answer will just be the initial small number. 
     console.log(7 % 10) // => 7;

    The String Data Type
    The string data type is a primitive data type that used to represent textual data.

    can be wrapped by either single or double quotation marks, best to choose one and stick with it for consistency.
    If your string contains quotation marks inside, can layer single or double quotation marks to allow it to work.
     “That’s a great string”; (valid)
     
     ‘Shakespeare wrote, “To be or not to be”’; (valid)
     
     ‘That’s a bad string’; (invalid)
    Alt. way to add other quotes within strings is to use template literals.
     `This is a temp’l’ate literal ${function}` // use ${} to invoke functions within.
    .length : property that can be appended to data to return the length.
    empty strings have a length of zero.
    indices : indexes of data that begin at 0, can call upon index by using the bracket notation [ ].
     console.log(“bootcamp”[0]); // => “b”
     console.log(“bootcamp”[10]); // => “undefined”
     console.log(“boots”[1 * 2]); // => “o”
     console.log(“boots”[“boot”.length-1]); // => “t”
    we can pass expressions through the brackets as well since JS always evaluates expressions first.
    The index of the last character of a string is always one less than it’s length.
    indexOf() : method used to find the first index of a given character within a string.
     console.log(“bagel”.indexOf(“b”)); // => 0
     console.log(“bagel”.indexOf(“z”)); // => -1
    if the character inside the indexOf() search does not exist in the string, the output will be -1.
    the indexOf() search will return the first instanced index of the the char in the string.
    concatenate : word to describe joining strings together into a single string.

    The Boolean Data Type
    The Boolean data type is the simplest data type since there are only two values: true and false.

    Logical Operators (Boolean Operators) are used to establish logic in our code.
    ! (not) : reverses a Boolean value.
     console.log(!true); // => false
     console.log(!!false); // => false
    Logical Order of Operations : JS will evaluate !, then &&, then ||.
    Short-Circuit Evaluation : Because JS evalutes from left to right, expressions can “short-circuit”. For example if we have true on the left of an || logical comparison, it will stop evaluating and yield true instead of wasting resources on processing the rest of the statement.
     console.log(true || !false) // => stops after it sees “true ||”

    Comparison Operators
    All comparison operators will result in a boolean output.
    The relative comparators

    > (greater than)
    < (less than)
    >= (greater than or equal to)
    <= (less than or equal to)
    === (equal to)
    !== (not equal to)

    Fun Fact: “a” < “b” is considered valid JS Code because string comparisons are compared lexicographically (meaning dictionary order), so “a” is less than “b” because it appears earlier!
    If there is ever a standstill comparison of two string lexicographically (i.e. app vs apple) the comparison will deem the shorter string lesser.
    Difference between == and ===
    ===
    Strict Equality, will only return true if the two comparisons are entirely the same.
    ==
    Loose Equality, will return true even if the values are of a different type, due to coercion. (Avoid using this)
    Variables
    Variables are used to store information to be referenced and manipulated in a program.

    We initialize a variable by using the let keyword and a = single equals sign (assignment operator). 
     let bootcamp = “App Academy”;
     console.log(bootcamp); // “App Academy”
    JS variable names can contain any alphanumeric characters, underscores, or dollar signs (cannot being with a number).
    If you do not declare a value for a variable, undefined is automatically set. 
     let bootcamp;
     console.log(bootcamp); // undefined
    We can change the value of a previously declared variable (let, not const) by re-assigning it another value.
    let is the updated version of var; there are some differences in terms of hoisting and global/block scope

    Assignment Shorthand
    let num = 0;
     num += 10; // same as num = num + 10
     num -= 2; // same as num = num — 2
     num /= 4; // same as num = num / 4
     num *= 7; // same as num = num * 7

    In general, any nonsensical arithmetic will result in NaN ; usually operations that include undefined.

    Functions
    A function is a procedure of code that will run when called. Functions are used so that we do not have to rewrite code to do the same thing over and over. (Think of them as ‘subprograms’)

    Function Declaration : Process when we first initially write our function.
    Includes three things:
    Name of the function.
    A list of parameters ()
    The code to execute {}
    Function Calls : We can call upon our function whenever and wherever* we want. (*wherever is only after the initial declaration)
    JS evaluates code top down, left to right.
    When we execute a declared function later on in our program we refer to this as invoking our function.
    Every function in JS returns undefined unless otherwise specified.
    When we hit a return statement in a function we immediately exit the function and return to where we called the function.
    When naming functions in JS always use camelCase and name it something appropriate.

    Greate code reads like English and almost explains itself. Think: Elegant, readable, and maintainable!
    Parameters and Arguments

    Parameters : Comma seperated variables specified as part of a function’s declaration.
    Arguments : Values passed to the function when it is invoked.
    If the number of arguments passed during a function invocation is different than the number of paramters listed, it will still work.
    However, is there are not enough arguments provided for parameters our function will likely yield Nan.

    Including Comments
    Comments are important because they help other people understand what is going on in your code or remind you if you forgot something yourself. Keep in mind that they have to be marked properly so the browser won’t try to execute them.
    In JavaScript you have two different options:

    Single-line comments — To include a comment that is limited to a single line, precede it with //
    Multi-line comments — In case you want to write longer comments between several lines, wrap it in /* and */ to avoid it from being executed

    Variables in JavaScript
    Variables are stand-in values that you can use to perform operations. You should be familiar with them from math class.
    var, const, let
    You have three different possibilities for declaring a variable in JavaScript, each with their own specialties:

    var — The most common variable. It can be reassigned but only accessed within a function. Variables defined with var move to the top when the code is executed.
    const — Can not be reassigned and not accessible before they appear within the code.
    let — Similar to const, the let variable can be reassigned but not re-declared.

    Data Types
    Variables can contain different types of values and data types. You use = to assign them:

    Numbers — var age = 23
    Variables — var x
    Text (strings) — var a = "init"
    Operations — var b = 1 + 2 + 3
    True or false statements — var c = true
    Constant numbers — const PI = 3.14
    Objects — var name = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe"}

    There are more possibilities. Note that variables are case sensitive. That means lastname and lastName will be handled as two different variables.
    Objects
    Objects are certain kinds of variables. They are variables that can have their own values and methods. The latter are actions that you can perform on objects.
    var person = {
    firstName:”John”,
    lastName:”Doe”,
    age:20,
    nationality:”German”
    };
    The Next Level: Arrays
    Next up in our JavaScript cheat sheet are arrays. Arrays are part of many different programming languages. They are a way of organizing variables and properties into groups. Here’s how to create one in JavaScript:
    var fruit = [“Banana”, “Apple”, “Pear”];
    Now you have an array called fruit which contains three items that you can use for future operations.
    Array Methods
    Once you have created arrays, there are a few things you can do with them:

    concat() — Join several arrays into one
    indexOf() — Returns the first position at which a given element appears in an array
    join() — Combine elements of an array into a single string and return the string
    lastIndexOf() — Gives the last position at which a given element appears in an array
    pop() — Removes the last element of an array
    push() — Add a new element at the end
    reverse() — Sort elements in a descending order
    shift() — Remove the first element of an array
    slice() — Pulls a copy of a portion of an array into a new array
    sort() — Sorts elements alphabetically
    splice() — Adds elements in a specified way and position
    toString() — Converts elements to strings
    unshift() —Adds a new element to the beginning
    valueOf() — Returns the primitive value of the specified object

    Operators
    If you have variables, you can use them to perform different kinds of operations. To do so, you need operators.
    Basic Operators

    + — Addition
    - — Subtraction
    * — Multiplication
    / — Division
    (...) — Grouping operator, operations within brackets are executed earlier than those outside
    % — Modulus (remainder )
    ++ — Increment numbers
    -- — Decrement numbers

    Comparison Operators

    == — Equal to
    === — Equal value and equal type
    != — Not equal
    !== — Not equal value or not equal type
    > — Greater than
    < — Less than
    >= — Greater than or equal to
    <= — Less than or equal to
    ? — Ternary operator

    Logical Operators

    && — Logical and
    || — Logical or
    ! — Logical not

    Bitwise Operators

    & — AND statement
    | — OR statement
    ~ — NOT
    ^ — XOR
    << — Left shift
    >> — Right shift
    >>> — Zero fill right shift

    Functions
    JavaScript functions are blocks of code that perform a certain task. A basic function looks like this:
    function name(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {
    // what the function does
    }
    As you can see, it consists of the function keyword plus a name. The function’s parameters are in the brackets and you have curly brackets around what the function performs. You can create your own, but to make your life easier – there are also a number of default functions.
    Outputting Data
    A common application for functions is the output of data. For the output, you have the following options:

    alert() — Output data in an alert box in the browser window
    confirm() — Opens up a yes/no dialog and returns true/false depending on user click
    console.log() — Writes information to the browser console, good for debugging purposes
    document.write() — Write directly to the HTML document
    prompt() — Creates a dialogue for user input

    Global Functions
    Global functions are functions built into every browser capable of running JavaScript.

    decodeURI() — Decodes a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) created by encodeURI or similar
    decodeURIComponent() — Decodes a URI component
    encodeURI() — Encodes a URI into UTF-8
    encodeURIComponent() — Same but for URI components
    eval() — Evaluates JavaScript code represented as a string
    isFinite() — Determines whether a passed value is a finite number
    isNaN() — Determines whether a value is NaN or not
    Number() —- Returns a number converted from its argument
    parseFloat() — Parses an argument and returns a floating-point number
    parseInt() — Parses its argument and returns an integer

    JavaScript Loops
    Loops are part of most programming languages. They allow you to execute blocks of code desired number of times with different values:
    for (before loop; condition for loop; execute after loop) {
    // what to do during the loop
    }
    You have several parameters to create loops:

    for — The most common way to create a loop in JavaScript
    while — Sets up conditions under which a loop executes
    do while — Similar to the while loop but it executes at least once and performs a check at the end to see if the condition is met to execute again
    break —Used to stop and exit the cycle at certain conditions
    continue — Skip parts of the cycle if certain conditions are met

    If — Else Statements
    These types of statements are easy to understand. Using them, you can set conditions for when your code is executed. If certain conditions apply, something is done, if not — something else is executed.
    if (condition) {
    // what to do if condition is met
    } else {
    // what to do if condition is not met
    }
    A similar concept to if else is the switch statement. However, using the switch you select one of several code blocks to execute.
    Strings
    Strings are what JavaScript calls to text that does not perform a function but can appear on the screen.
    var person = “John Doe”;
    In this case, John Doe is the string.
    Escape Characters
    In JavaScript, strings are marked with single or double-quotes. If you want to use quotation marks in a string, you need to use special characters:

    \' — Single quote
    \" — Double quote

    Aside from that you also have additional escape characters:

    \\ — Backslash
    \b — Backspace
    \f — Form feed
    \n — New line
    \r — Carriage return
    \t — Horizontal tabulator
    \v — Vertical tabulator

    String Methods
    There are many different ways to work with strings:

    charAt() — Returns a character at a specified position inside a string
    charCodeAt() — Gives you the Unicode of a character at that position
    concat() — Concatenates (joins) two or more strings into one
    fromCharCode() — Returns a string created from the specified sequence of UTF-16 code units
    indexOf() — Provides the position of the first occurrence of a specified text within a string
    lastIndexOf() — Same as indexOf() but with the last occurrence, searching backward
    match() — Retrieves the matches of a string against a search pattern
    replace() — Find and replace specified text in a string
    search() — Executes a search for a matching text and returns its position
    slice() — Extracts a section of a string and returns it as a new string
    split() — Splits a string object into an array of strings at a specified position
    substr() — Similar to slice() but extracts a substring depending on a specified number of characters
    substring() — Also similar to slice() but can’t accept negative indices
    toLowerCase() — Convert strings to lower case
    toUpperCase() — Convert strings to upper case
    valueOf() — Returns the primitive value (that has no properties or methods) of a string object

    Regular expressions are search patterns used to match character combinations in strings. The search pattern can be used for text search and text to replace operations.
    Pattern Modifiers

    e — Evaluate replacement
    i — Perform case-insensitive matching
    g — Perform global matching

    Errors
    When working with JavaScript, different errors can occur. There are several ways of handling them:

    try — Lets you define a block of code to test for errors
    catch — Set up a block of code to execute in case of an error
    throw — Create custom error messages instead of the standard JavaScript errors
    finally — Lets you execute code, after try and catch, regardless of the result

    Error Name Values
    JavaScript also has a built-in error object. It has two properties:

    name — Sets or returns the error name
    message — Sets or returns an error message in a string from

    The error property can return six different values as its name:

    EvalError — An error has occurred in the eval() function
    RangeError — A number is “out of range”
    ReferenceError — An illegal reference has occurred
    SyntaxError — A syntax error has occurred
    TypeError — A type error has occurred
    URIError — An encodeURI() error has occurred

    Explicit Conversions
    The simplest way to perform an explicit type conversion is to use the Boolean(), Number(), and String() functions.
    Any value other than nullor undefinedhas atoString() method.
    n.toString(2);
    binary
    n.toString(8);
    octal
    n.toString(16);
    hex
    let n = 123456.789;
    n.toFixed(0)
    “123457”
    n.toFixed(5)
    “123456.78900”
    n.toExponential(3)
    “1.235e+5”
    n.toPrecision(7)
    “123456.8”
    n.toPrecision(10)

    Destructuring Assignment
    let [x,y] = [1,2];
    let x=1, y=2
    [x,y] = [x + 1,y + 1];
    x = x + 1, y = y + 1
    [x,y] = [y,x];
    Swap the value of the two variables
    Destructuring assignment makes it easy to work with functions that return arrays of values:
    let [r,theta] = toPolar(1.0, 1.0);
    function toPolar(x, y) {
    return [Math.sqrt(xx+yy), Math.atan2(y,x)];
    }
    Variable destructuring in loops:
    let o = { x: 1, y: 2 };
    for(const [name, value] of Object.entries(o)) {
    console.log(name, value); // Prints "x 1" and "y 2"
    }
    Note: The Object.entries() method returns an array of a given object’s own enumerable string-keyed property [key, value] pairs, in the same order as that provided by a for...in loop. (The only important difference is that a for...in loop enumerates properties in the prototype chain as well).
    The list of variables on the left can include extra commas to skip certain values on the right
    [,x,,y] = [1,2,3,4];
    x == 2; y == 4
    Note: the last comma does not stand for a value.
    To collect all unused or remaining values into a single variable when destructuring an array, use three dots (...)before the last variable name on the left-hand side
    let [x, ...y] = [1,2,3,4];
    y == [2,3,4]
    let [first, ...rest] = "Hello";
    first == “H”; rest ==[“e”,”l”,”l”,”o”]
    Destructuring assignment can also be performed when the righthand side is an object value.
    let transparent = {r: 0.0, g: 0.0, b: 0.0, a: 1.0};
    let {r, g, b} = transparent;
    r == 0.0; g == 0.0; b == 0.0
    const {sin, cos, tan} = Math;
    sin=Math.sin, cos=Math.cos, tan=Math.tan
    Expressions and Operators
    In JavaScript, the values nulland undefinedare the only two values that do not have properties. In a regular property access expression using . or [], you get a TypeError if the expression on the left evaluates to nullor undefined. You can use ?. and ?.[] syntax to guard against errors of this type.
    You can also invoke a function using ?.() instead of ().
    With the new ?.() invocation syntax, if the expression to the left of the ?. evaluates to null or undefined, then the entire invocation expression evaluates to undefinedand no exception is thrown.
    Write the function invocation using ?.(), knowing that invocation will only happen if there is actually a value to be invoked
    function square(x, log) {
    log?.(x); // Call the function if there is one
    return x * x;
    }
    Note that expression x++ is not always the same as x = x + 1.The ++ operator never performs string concatenation: it always converts its operand to a number and increments it. If x is the string “1”, ++x is the number 2, butx + 1 is the string “11”.
    JavaScript objects are compared by reference, not by value. An object is equal to itself, but not to any other object. If two distinct objects have the same number of properties, with the same names and values, they are still not equal. Similarly, two arrays that have the same elements in the same order are not equal to each other.
    NaNvalue is never equal to any other value, including itself! To check whether a value x is NaN, use x !== , or the global isNaN() function.
    If both values refer to the same object, array, or function, they are equal. If they refer to different objects, they are not equal, even if both objects have identical properties.
    Evaluating Expressions
    JavaScript has the ability to interpret strings of JavaScript source code, evaluating them to produce a value.
    eval("3+2")
    Because of security issues, some web servers use the HTTP “Content-Security-Policy” header to disableeval() for an entire website.
    First-Defined (??)
    The first-defined operator ?? evaluates to its first defined operand: if its left operand is not null and not undefined, it returns that value.
    a ?? b is equivalent to (a !== null && a !== undefined) ? a : b
    ?? is a useful alternative to ||. The problem with this idiomatic use is that zero, the empty string, and false are all falsyvalues that may be perfectly valid in some circumstances. In this code example, if maxWidthis zero, that value will be ignored. But if we change the || operator to ??, we end up with an expression where zero is a valid value.
    let max = maxWidth || preferences.maxWidth || 500;
    let max = maxWidth ?? preferences.maxWidth ?? 500;
    delete Operator
    Deleting an array element leaves a “hole” in the array and does not change the array’s length. The resulting array is sparse.
    void Operator
    Using the void operator makes sense only if the operand has side effects.
    let counter = 0;
    const increment = () => void counter++;
    increment()
    undefined
    counter
    1
    Statements
    Expressions are evaluated to produce a value, but statements are executed to make something happen.
    Expressions with side effects, such as assignments and function invocations, can stand alone as statements, and when used this way are known as expression statements.
    A similar category of statements are the declaration statements that declare new variables and define new functions.
    If a function does not have any side effects, there is no sense in calling it, unless it is part of a larger expression or an assignment statement.
    for/of
    The for/of loop works with iterable objects. Arrays, strings, sets, and maps are iterable.
    Array
    let data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], sum = 0;
    for(let element of data) {
    sum += element;
    }
    let text = "Na na na na na na na na";
    let wordSet = new Set(text.split(" "));
    let unique = [];
    for(let word of wordSet) {
    unique.push(word);
    }
    String
    let frequency = {};
    for(let letter of "mississippi") {
    if (frequency[letter]) {
    frequency[letter]++;
    }
    else {
    frequency[letter] = 1;
    }
    }
    Map
    let m = new Map([[1, "one"]]);
    for(let [key, value] of m) {
    key // => 1
    value // => "one"
    }
    Objects are not (by default) iterable. Attempting to use for/of on a regular object throws a TypeError at runtime.
    If you want to iterate through the properties of an object, you can use the for/in loop.
    Note: for/of can be used on objects with Object.entries property, but it will not pick properties from object’s prototype.
    for/in
    for/in loop works with any object after the in.
    for(let p in o) {
    console.log(o[p]);
    }
    Note: this will enumerate array indexes, not values.
    for(let i in a) console.log(i);
    The for/in loop does not actually enumerate all properties of an object. It does not enumerate properties whose names are symbols. And of the properties whose names are strings, it only loops over the enumerableproperties.
    with
    The with statement runs a block of code as if the properties of a specified object were variables in scope for that code.
    The withstatement is forbidden in strict mode and should be considered deprecated in non-strict mode: avoid using it whenever possible.
    document.forms[0].address.value
    with(document.forms[0]) {
    name.value = "";
    address.value = "";
    email.value = "";
    }
    debugger
    If a debugger program is available and is running, then an implementation may (but is not required to) perform some kind of debugging action.
    In practice, this statement acts like a breakpoint: execution of JavaScript code stops, and you can use the debugger to print variables’ values, examine the call stack, and so on.
    Note that it is not enough to have a debugger available: the debugger statement won’t start the debugger for you. If you’re using a web browser and have the developer tools console open, however, this statement will cause a breakpoint.
    use strict
    Strict mode is a restricted subset of the language that fixes important language deficiencies and provides stronger error checking and increased security.
    The differences between strict mode and non-strict mode are the following:
    · The withstatement is not allowed in strict mode.
    · In strict mode, all variables must be declared: a ReferenceErroris thrown if you assign a value to an identifier that is not a declared variable, function, function parameter, catch clause parameter, or property of the global object.
    · In non-strict mode, this implicitly declares a global variable by adding a new property to the global object.
    · In strict mode, functions invoked as functions (rather than as methods) have a thisvalue of undefined. (In non-strict mode, functions invoked as functions are always passed the global object as their thisvalue.)
    · A function is invoked with call()or apply() , the thisvalue is exactly the value passed as the first argument to call() or apply(). (In non-strict mode, nulland undefinedvalues are replaced with the global object and non-object values are converted to objects.)
    · In strict mode, assignments to non-writable properties and attempts to create new properties on non-extensible objects throw a TypeError. (In non-strict mode, these attempts fail silently.)
    · In strict mode, code passed to eval()cannot declare variables or define functions in the caller’s scope as it can in non-strict mode. Instead, variable and function definitions live in a new scope created for the eval(). This scope is discarded when the eval() returns.
    · In strict mode, the Arguments object in a function holds a static copy of the values passed to the function. In non-strict mode, the Arguments object has “magical” behavior in which elements of the array and named function parameters both refer to the same value.
    · In strict mode, a SyntaxErroris thrown if the deleteoperator is followed by an unqualified identifier such as a variable, function, or function parameter. (In non-strict mode, such a deleteexpression does nothing and evaluates to false.)
    · In strict mode, an attempt to delete a non-configurable property throws a TypeError. (In non-strict mode, the attempt fails and the delete expression evaluates to false.)
    · In strict mode, it is a syntax error for an object literal to define two or more properties by the same name. (In non-strict mode, no error occurs.)
    Objects
    In addition to its name and value, each property has three property attributes:
    · The writableattribute specifies whether the value of the property can be set.
    · The enumerableattribute specifies whether the property name is returned by a for/in loop.
    · The configurableattribute specifies whether the property can be deleted and whether its attributes can be altered.
    Prototypes
    All objects created by object literals have the same prototype object, Object.prototype.
    Objects created using the newkeyword and a constructor invocation use the value of the prototype property of the constructor function as their prototype.
    Object created by new Object() inherits from Object.prototype, just as the object created by {} does. Similarly, the object created by new Array() uses Array.prototype as its prototype, and the object created bynew Date() uses Date.prototype as its prototype.
    Almost all objects have a prototype, but only a relatively small number of objects have a prototypeproperty. It is these objects with prototype properties that define the prototypes for all the other objects.
    Most built-in constructors (and most user-defined constructors) have a prototype that inherits from Object.prototype.
    Date.prototype inherits properties from Object.prototype, so a Date object created by new Date() inherits properties from both Date.prototype and Object.prototype. This linked series of prototype objects is known as a prototype chain.
    Creating Objects
    Objects can be created with object literals, with the new keyword, and with the Object.create() function.
    Literal
    let empty = {};
    let point = { x: 0, y: 0 };
    let book = {
    "main title": "JavaScript",
    "sub-title": "The Definitive Guide",
    for: "all audiences",
    author: {
    firstname: "David", .
    surname: "Flanagan"
    }
    };
    new
    let o = new Object();
     let a = new Array();
     let d = new Date();
     let r = new Map();
    Object.create
    let o3 = Object.create(Object.prototype);
    Use Object.create to guard against accidental modifications:
    let o = { x: "don't change this value" };
    library.function(Object.create(o));
    Note: the library function can modify the passed in object, but not the original o object
    Access Object Properties with an array ([]) notation
    let addr = "";
    for(let i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
    addr += customer[address${i}] + "\n";
    }
    Inheritance
    let o = {};
    o.x = 1;
    let p = Object.create(o);
    p.y = 2;
    let q = Object.create(p);
    q.z = 3;
    Property x and y available on object q
    q.x + q.y
    How to query for property which may be undefined
    surname = book && book.author && book.author.surname;
    let surname = book?.author?.surname;
    Deleting properties
    The delete operator only deletes own properties, not inherited ones. (To delete an inherited property, you must delete it from the prototype object in which it is defined. Doing this affects every object that inherits from that prototype.)
    delete does not remove properties that have a configurableattribute of false.
    Certain properties of built-in objects are non-configurable, as are properties of the global object created by variable declaration and function declaration.
    delete Object.prototype
    false: property is non-configurable
    var x = 1;
    delete globalThis.x
    false: can’t delete thisproperty
    function f() {}
    delete globalThis.f
    false
    globalThis.x = 1;
    delete globalThis.x
    true
    Testing properties
    To check whether an object has a property with a given name. You can do this with the in operator, with the hasOwnProperty() and propertyIsEnumerable() methods, or simply by querying the property
    ( != undefined).
    in & query
    let o = { x: 1 };
    "x" in o
    true
    o.x !== undefined
    "y" in o
    false
    o.y !== undefined
    "toString" in o
    true: o inherits a toStringproperty
    o.toString !== undefined
    Advantage of using in: in can distinguish between properties that do not exist and properties that exist but have been set to undefined.
    hasOwnProperty
    let o = { x: 1 };
    o.hasOwnProperty("x")
    true
    o.hasOwnProperty("y")
    false
    o.hasOwnProperty("toString")
    false: toString is an inherited property
    The propertyIsEnumerable() returns true only if the named property is an own property and its enumerable attribute is true.
    let o = { x: 1 };
    o.propertyIsEnumerable("x")
    true
    o.propertyIsEnumerable("toString")
    false: not an own property
    Object.prototype.propertyIsEnumerable("toString")
    false: not enumerable
    Enumerating properties
    To guard against enumerating inherited properties with for/in, you can add an explicit check inside the loop body:
    for(let p in o) {
    if (!o.hasOwnProperty(p)) continue;
    }
    for(let p in o) {
    if (typeof o[p] === "function") continue;
    }
    Functions you can use to get an array of property names
    · Object.keys() returns an array of the names of the enumerable own properties of an object. It does not include non-enumerable properties, inherited properties, or properties whose name is a Symbol.
    · Object.getOwnPropertyNames() works like Object.keys()but returns an array of the names of nonenumerable own properties as well.
    · Object.getOwnPropertySymbols() returns own properties whose names are Symbols, whether or not they are enumerable.
    · Reflect.ownKeys() returns all own property names, both enumerable and non-enumerable, and both string and Symbol.
    Extending Objects
    To copy the properties of one object to another object
    let target = {x: 1}, source = {y: 2, z: 3};
    for(let key of Object.keys(source)) {
    target[key] = source[key];
    }
    One reason to assign properties from one object into another is when you have an object that defines default values for many properties and you want to copy those default properties into another object if a property by that name does not already exist in that object. Using Object.assign() naively will not do what you want:
    Object.assign(o, defaults);
    overwrites everything in o with defaults
    Instead, use one of the following:,
    o = Object.assign({}, defaults, o);
    o = {...defaults, ...o};
    Serializing Objects
    The functions JSON.stringify() andJSON.parse() serialize and restore JavaScript objects.
    let o = {x: 1, y: {z: [false, null, ""]}};
    let s = JSON.stringify(o);
    s == ‘{“x”:1,”y”:{“z”:[false,null,””]}}’
    let p = JSON.parse(s);
    p == {x: 1, y: {z: [false,null, “”]}}
    Object methods
    toString(), valueOf(), loLocaleString(), toJSON()
    let s = { x: 1, y: 1 }.toString();
    s == “[object Object]”
    Extended Object Literal Syntax
    Shorthand Properties
    let x = 1, y = 2;
    let o = {
    x: x,
    y: y
    };
    ←>
    let x = 1, y = 2;
     let o = { x, y };
    Computer Property Names
    const PROPERTY_NAME = "p1";
     function computePropertyName() { return "p" + 2; }
    let o = {};
    oPROPERTY_NAME = 1;
    ocomputePropertyName() = 2;
    ←>
    let p = {
    };
    Symbols as Property Names
    const extension = Symbol("my extension symbol");
    let o = {
    };
    oextension.x = 0;
    Two Symbols created with the same string argument are still different from one another.
    The point of Symbols is not security, but to define a safe extension mechanism for JavaScript objects. If you get an object from third-party code that you do not control and need to add some of your own properties to that object but want to be sure that your properties will not conflict with any properties that may already exist on the object, you can safely use Symbols as your property names.
    Spread Operator
    You can copy the properties of an existing object into a new object using the “spread operator” … inside an object literal:
    let position = { x: 0, y: 0 };
     let dimensions = { width: 100, height: 75 };
     let rect = { ...position, ...dimensions };
     rect.x + rect.y + rect.width + rect.height
    Shorthand Methods
    let square = {
    area: function() {
    return this.side * this.side; },
    side: 10
    };
    ←>
    let square = {
    area() {
    return this.side * this.side; },
    side: 10
    };
    When you write a method using this shorthand syntax, the property name can take any of the forms that are legal in an object literal: in addition to a regular JavaScript identifier like the name area above, you can also use string literals and computed property names, which can include Symbol property names:
    const METHOD_NAME = "m";
    const symbol = Symbol();
    let weirdMethods = {
    "method With Spaces"(x) { return x + 1; },
    METHOD_NAME { return x + 2; },
    symbol { return x + 3; }
    };
    weirdMethods["method With Spaces"](1)
    2
    weirdMethods[METHOD_NAME](1)
    3
    weirdMethods[symbol](1)
    4
    Property Getters and Setters
    let o = {
    dataProp: value,
    get accessorProp() { return this.dataProp; },
    set accessorProp(value) { this.dataProp = value; }
    };
    Arrays
    Creating Arrays
    · Array literals
    · The … spread operator on an iterable object
    · The Array() constructor
    · The Array.of() and Array.from() factory methods
    Array literals
    let empty = [];
    let primes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11];
    let misc = [ 1.1, true, "a", ];
    let b = [[1, {x: 1, y: 2}], [2, {x: 3, y: 4}]];
    If an array literal contains multiple commas in a row, with no value between, the array is sparse
    let count = [1,,3];
    let undefs = [,,];
    Array literal syntax allows an optional trailing comma, so [,,] has a length of 2, not 3.
    The Spread Operator
    let a = [1, 2, 3];
    let b = [0, ...a, 4];
    [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
    create a copy of an array — modifying the copy does not change the original
    let original = [1,2,3];
     let copy = [...original];
    let digits = [..."0123456789ABCDEF"];
    [“0”,”1“,”2“,”3“,”4“,”5“,”6“,”7“,”8“,”9“,”A”,”B”,”C”,”D”,”E”,”F”]
    let letters = [..."hello world"];
    [“h”,”e”,”l”,”l””o”,””,”w”,”o””r”,”l”,”d”]
    [...new Set(letters)]
    [“h”,”e”,”l”,”o”,””,”w”,”r”,”d”]
    Array.of()
    When the Array() constructor function is invoked with one numeric argument, it uses that argument as an array length. But when invoked with more than one numeric argument, it treats those arguments as elements for the array to be created. This means that the Array() constructor cannot be used to create an array with a single numeric element.
    Array.of()
    []
    Array.of(10)
    [10]
    Array.of(1,2,3)
    [1, 2, 3]
    Array.from()
    It is also a simple way to make a copy of an array:
    let copy = Array.from(original);
    Array.from() is also important because it defines a way to make a true-array copy of an array-like object. Array-like objects are non-array objects that have a numeric length property and have values stored with properties whose names happen to be integers.
    let truearray = Array.from(arraylike);
    Array.from() also accepts an optional second argument. If you pass a function as the second argument, then as the new array is being built, each element from the source object will be passed to the function you specify, and the return value of the function will be stored in the array instead of the original value.
    Reading and Writing Array Elements
    What is special about arrays is that when you use property names that are non-negative integers , the array automatically maintains the value of the length property for you.
    JavaScript converts the numeric array index you specify to a string — the index 1 becomes the string “1”, then uses that string as a property name.
    It is helpful to clearly distinguish an array index from an object property name. All indexes are property names, but only property names that are integers between 0 and 231 are indexes. All arrays are objects, and you can create properties of any name on them. If you use properties that are array indexes, however, arrays have the special behavior of updating their length property as needed.
    Note that you can index an array using numbers that are negative or that are not integers. When you do this, the number is converted to a string, and that string is used as the property name. Since the name is not a non-negative integer, it is treated as a regular object property, not an array index.
    a[-1.23] = true;
    This creates a property named “-1.23”
    a["1000"] = 0;
    This the 1001st element of the array
    a[1.000] = 1;
    Array index 1. Same as a[1] = 1;
    The fact that array indexes are simply a special type of object property name means that JavaScript arrays have no notion of an “out of bounds” error. When you try to query a nonexistent property of any object, you don’t get an error; you simply get undefined.
    Sparse Arrays
    Sparse arrays can be created with the Array() constructor or simply by assigning to an array index larger than the current array length.
    a[1000] = 0;
    Assignment adds one element but sets length to 1001.
    you can also make an array sparse with the delete operator.
    Note that when you omit a value in an array literal (using repeated commas as in [1,,3]), the resulting array is sparse, and the omitted elements simply do not exist
    Array Length
    if you set the length property to a nonnegative integer n smaller than its current value, any array elements whose index is greater than or equal to n are deleted from the array.
    a = [1,2,3,4,5];
    a.length = 3;
    a is now [1,2,3].
    a.length = 0;
    Delete all elements. a is [].
    a.length = 5;
    Length is 5, but no elements, like new Array(5)
    You can also set the length property of an array to a value larger than its current value. Doing this does not actually add any new elements to the array; it simply creates a sparse area at the end of the array.
    Adding and Deleting Array Elements
    let a = [];
    a[0] = "zero";
    a[1] = "one";
    add elements to it.
    You can also use the push() method to add one or more values to the end of an array.
    You can use theunshift() method to insert a value at the beginning of an array, shifting the existing array elements to higher indexes.
    The pop() method is the opposite of push(): it removes the last element of the array and returns it, reducing the length of an array by 1.
    Similarly, the shift() method removes and returns the first element of the array, reducing the length by 1 and shifting all elements down to an index one lower than their current index.
    You can delete array elements with the delete operator
    let a = [1,2,3];
    delete a[2];
    a now has no element at index 2
    2 in a
    false
    a.length
    3: delete does not affect array length
    Iterating Arrays
    The easiest way to loop through each of the elements of an array (or any iterable object) is with the for/ofloop
    let letters = [..."Hello world"];
    let string = "";
    for(let letter of letters) {
    string += letter;
    }
    It has no special behavior for sparse arrays and simply returns undefined for any array elements that do not exist.
    If you want to use a for/of loop for an array and need to know the index of each array element, use the entries() method of the array
    let letters = [..."Hello world"];
    let everyother = "";
    for(let [index, letter] of letters.entries()) {
    if (index % 2 === 0) everyother += letter;
    }
    Another good way to iterate arrays is with forEach(). This is not a new form of the for loop, but an array method that offers a functional approach to array iteration.
    let letters = [..."Hello world"];
    let uppercase = "";
    letters.forEach(letter => {
    uppercase += letter.toUpperCase();
    });
    You can also loop through the elements of an array with a for loop.
    for(let i = 0, len = letters.length; i < len; i++) {
    // loop body
    }
    Multidimensional Arrays
    Create a multidimensional array
    let table = new Array(10);
    for(let i = 0; i < table.length; i++) {
    table[i] = new Array(10);
    }
    for(let row = 0; row < table.length; row++) {
    for(let col = 0; col < table[row].length; col++) {
    table[row][col] = row * col;
    }
    }
    Array Methods
    Array Iterator Methods
    First, all of these methods accept a function as their first argument and invoke that function once for each element (or some elements) of the array. If the array is sparse, the function you pass is not invoked for nonexistent elements. In most cases, the function you supply is invoked with three arguments: the value of the array element, the index of the array element, and the array itself.
    FOREACH()
    let data = [1,2,3,4,5], sum = 0;
    data.forEach(value => { sum += value; });
    data.forEach(function(v, i, a) {
    a[i] = v + 1;
    });
    15
    [2,3,4,5,6]
    MAP()
    let a = [1, 2, 3];
     a.map(x => x*x)
    [1, 4, 9]
    FILTER()
    let a = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1];
     a.filter(x => x < 3)
     a.filter((x,i) => i % 2 === 0)
    [2, 1];
    [5, 3, 1];
    FIND()
    FINDINDEX()
    let a = [1,2,3,4,5];
    a.findIndex(x => x === 3)
    a.find(x => x % 5 === 0)
    a.find(x => x % 7 === 0)
    2
    5
    undefined
    EVERY()
    SOME()
    let a = [1,2,3,4,5];
    a.every(x => x < 10)
    a.some(x => x % 2 === 0)
    a.some(isNaN)
    true
    true
    false
    REDUCE()
    ReduceRight()
    let a = [1,2,3,4,5];
    a.reduce((x,y) => x+y, 0)
    a.reduce((x,y) => x*y, 1)
    a.reduce((x,y) => (x > y) ? x : y)
    15
    120
    5
    Note that map() returns a new array: it does not modify the array it is invoked on. If that array is sparse, your function will not be called for the missing elements, but the returned array will be sparse in the same way as the original array: it will have the same length and the same missing elements.
    To close the gaps in a sparse array, you can do this:
    let dense = sparse.filter(() => true);
    And to close gaps and remove undefined and null elements, you can use filter, like this:
    a = a.filter(x => x !== undefined && x !== null);
    Unlike filter(), however,find() and findIndex() stop iterating the first time the predicate finds an element. When that happens, find() returns the matching element, and findIndex() returns the index of the matching element. If no matching element is found,find() returns undefined andfindIndex()returns -1.
    When you invoke reduce() with no initial value, it uses the first element of the array as the initial value.
    reduceRight() works just like reduce(), except that it processes the array from highest index to lowest (right-to-left), rather than from lowest to highest. You might want to do this if the reduction operation has right-to-left associativity
    Flattening arrays with flat() and flatMap()
    [1, [2, 3]].flat()
    [1, 2, 3]
    [1, [2, [3]]].flat()
    [1, 2, [3]]
    let a = [1, [2, [3, [4]]]];
    a.flat(1)
    a.flat(2)
    a.flat(3)
    a.flat(4)
    [1, 2, [3, [4]]]
    [1, 2, 3, [4]]
    [1, 2, 3, 4]
    [1, 2, 3, 4]
    let phrases = ["hello world", "the definitive guide"];
     let words = phrases.flatMap(phrase => phrase.split(" "));
    [“hello”, “world”, “the”, “definitive”, “guide”];
    Calling a.flatMap(f) is the same as (but more efficient than) a.map(f).flat():
    Adding arrays with concat()
    let a = [1,2,3];
    a.concat(4, 5)
    [1,2,3,4,5]
    a.concat([4,5],[6,7])
    [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
    Stacks and Queues with push(), pop(), shift(), and unshift()
    The push() andpop() methods allow you to work with arrays as if they were stacks. The push() method appends one or more new elements to the end of an array and returns the new length of the array.
    The unshift() and shift() methods behave much like push() andpop(), except that they insert and remove elements from the beginning of an array rather than from the end.
    You can implement a queue data structure by using push() to add elements at the end of an array and shift() to remove them from the start of the array. Note differences in unshiftwith single and multiple values.
    let a = [];
    a.unshift(1)
    [1]
    a.unshift(2)
    [2, 1]
    a = [];
    a.unshift(1,2)
    [1, 2]
    Subarrays with slice(), splice(), fill(), and copyWithin()
    SLICE()
    let a = [1,2,3,4,5];
    a.slice(0,3);
    a.slice(3);
    a.slice(1,-1);
    a.slice(-3,-2);
    [1,2,3]
    [4,5]
    [2,3,4]
    [3]
    SPLICE
    let a = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8];
    a.splice(4)
    a.splice(1,2)
    a.splice(1,1)
    let a = [1,2,3,4,5];
    a.splice(2,0,"a","b")
    a.splice(2,2,[1,2],3)
    [5,6,7,8]; a is now [1,2,3,4]
    [2,3]; a is now [1,4]
    [4]; a is now [1]
    []; a is now [1,2,”a”,”b”,3,4,5]
    [“a”,”b”]; a is now [1,2,[1,2],3,3,4,5]
    FILL()
    let a = new Array(5);
    a.fill(0)
    a.fill(9, 1)
    a.fill(8, 2, -1)
    [0,0,0,0,0]
    [0,9,9,9,9]
    [0,9,8,8,9]
    COPYWITHIN()
    let a = [1,2,3,4,5];
    a.copyWithin(1)
    a.copyWithin(2, 3, 5)
    a.copyWithin(0, -2)
    [1,1,2,3,4]
    [1,1,3,4,4]
    [4,4,3,4,4]
    splice() is a general-purpose method for inserting or removing elements from an array.splice() can delete elements from an array, insert new elements into an array, or perform both operations at the same time.
    The first argument to splice() specifies the array position at which the insertion and/or deletion is to begin. The second argument specifies the number of elements that should be deleted from (spliced out of) the array.
    Unlike concat(), splice() inserts arrays themselves, not the elements of those arrays.
    copyWithin() copies a slice of an array to a new position within the array. It modifies the array in place and returns the modified array, but it will not change the length of the array.
    Array Searching and Sorting Methods
    INDEXOF()
     LASTINDEXOF()
    let a = [0,1,2,1,0];
    a.indexOf(1)
    a.lastIndexOf(1)
    a.indexOf(3)
    1
    3
    -1
    SORT()
    let a = [33, 4, 1111, 222];
    a.sort();
    a.sort((a,b) => a - b);
    Case-insensitive sort
    let a = ["ant", "Bug", "cat", "Dog"];
    a.sort(); // a == ["Bug","Dog","ant","cat"];
    a.sort(function(s,t) {
    let a = s.toLowerCase();
    let b = t.toLowerCase();
    if (a < b) return -1;
    if (a > b) return 1;
    return 0;
    });
    [1111, 222, 33, 4];
    [4, 33, 222, 1111]
    REVERSE()
    let a = [1,2,3];
     a.reverse();
    [3,2,1]
    indexOf() and lastIndexOf() compare their argument to the array elements using the equivalent of the === operator. If your array contains objects instead of primitive values, these methods check to see if two references both refer to exactly the same object. If you want to actually look at the content of an object, try using the find() method with your own custom predicate function instead.
    indexOf() and lastIndexOf() take an optional second argument that specifies the array index at which to begin the search. Negative values are allowed for the second argument and are treated as an offset from the end of the array.
    indexOf() will not detect the NaN value in an array, but includes() will
    When sort() is called with no arguments, it sorts the array elements in alphabetical order. To sort an array into some order other than alphabetical, you must pass a comparison function as an argument to sort().
    Array to String Conversions
    The join() method converts all the elements of an array to strings and concatenates them, returning the resulting string.
    let a = [1, 2, 3];
    a.join()
    a.join(" ")
    a.join("")
    “1,2,3”
    “1 2 3”
    “123”
    let b = new Array(10);
    b.join("-")
    “ — — — — -”
    Arrays, like all JavaScript objects, have a toString() method. For an array, this method works just like the join() method with no arguments:
    [1,2,3].toString()
    “1,2,3”
    ["a", "b", "c"].toString()
    “a,b,c”
    [1, [2,"c"]].toString()
    “1,2,c”
    Static Array Functions
    Array.isArray([])
    true
    Array.isArray({})
    false
    Array-Like Objects
    It is often perfectly reasonable to treat any object with a numeric length property and corresponding non-negative integer properties as a kind of array.
    let a = {};
    let i = 0;
    while(i < 10) {
    a[i] = i * i;
    i++;
    }
    a.length = i;
    // Now iterate through it as if it were a real array
    let total = 0;
    for(let j = 0; j < a.length; j++) {
    total += a[j];
    }
    Since array-like objects do not inherit from Array.prototype, you cannot invoke array methods on them directly. You can invoke them indirectly using the Function.call method.
    let a = {"0": "a", "1": "b", "2": "c", length: 3};
    // An array-like object
    Array.prototype.join.call(a, "+")
    “a+b+c”
    Array.prototype.join.call("JavaScript", " ")
    “J a v a S c r i p t”
    Array.prototype.map.call(a, x => x.toUpperCase())
    [“A”,”B”,”C”]
    Array.from(a)
    [“a”,”b”,”c”]
    Strings as Arrays
    let s = "test";
    s.charAt(0)
    t
    s[1]
    e
    Functions
    In addition to the arguments, each invocation has another value — the invocation context — that is the value of the this keyword.
    Function Declarations
    function printprops(o) {
    for(let p in o) {
    console.log(${p}: ${o[p]}\n);
    }
    }
    Function declaration statements are “hoisted” to the top of the enclosing script, function, or block so that functions defined in this way may be invoked from code that appears before the definition.
    Function Expressions
    const square = function(x) { return x*x; };
    const f = function fact(x) {
    if (x <= 1) return 1;
    return x * fact(x-1);
    }
    Function expressions can include names, which is useful for recursion
    [3,2,1].sort(function(a,b) { return a - b; });
    Function expressions can also be used as arguments to other functions
    let tensquared = (function(x) {return x*x;}(10));
    Function expressions are sometimes defined and immediately invoked
    Arrow Functions
    const sum = (x, y) => { return x + y; };
    const sum = (x, y) => x + y;
    no need for return
    const polynomial = x => x*x + 2*x + 3;
    omit parens with single parameter
    const constantFunc = () => 42;
    usage for no params
    If the body of your arrow function is a single return statement but the expression to be returned is an object literal, then you have to put the object literal inside parentheses to avoid syntactic ambiguity between the curly braces of a function body and the curly braces of an object literal
    const f = x => { return { value: x }; };
    good
    const g = x => ({ value: x });
    good
    const h = x => { value: x };
    returns nothing
    const i = x => { v: x, w: x };
    syntax error
    Arrow functions differ from functions defined in other ways in one critical way: they inherit the value of the this keyword from the environment in which they are defined rather than defining their own invocation context as functions defined in other ways do.
    Nested Functions
    function hypotenuse(a, b) {
    function square(x) { return x*x; }
    return Math.sqrt(square(a) + square(b));
    }
    Invoking Functions
    For function invocation in non-strict mode, the invocation context (the this value) is the global object. In strict mode, however, the invocation context is undefined.
    const strict = (function() { return !this; }())
    Determine if we’re in strict mode
    Constructor Invocation
    A constructor invocation creates a new, empty object that inherits from the object specified by the prototypeproperty of the constructor.
    Indirect invocation
    JavaScript functions are objects, and like all JavaScript objects, they have methods. Two of these methods, call() and apply(), invoke the function indirectly. Both methods allow you to explicitly specify the thisvalue for the invocation, which means you can invoke any function as a method of any object, even if it is not actually a method of that object.
    Function Arguments and Parameters
    Optional Parameters and Defaults
    When a function is invoked with fewer arguments than declared parameters, the additional parameters are set to their default value, which is normally undefined.
    function getPropertyNames(o, a) {
    a = a || [];
    for(let property in o) a.push(property);
    return a;
    }
    function getPropertyNames(o, a = []) {
    for(let property in o) a.push(property);
    return a;
    }
    One interesting case is that, for functions with multiple parameters, you can use the value of a previous parameter to define the default value of the parameters that follow it
    const rectangle = (width, height = width*2) => ({width, height});
    Rest Parameters and Variable-Length Argument Lists
    Rest parameters enable us to write functions that can be invoked with arbitrarily more arguments than parameters.
    function max(first=-Infinity, ...rest) {
    let maxValue = first;
    for(let n of rest) {
    if (n > maxValue) {
    maxValue = n;
    }
    }
    return maxValue;
    }
    max(1, 10, 100, 2, 3, 1000, 4, 5, 6)
    1000
    within the body of a function, the value of a rest parameter will always be an array. The array may be empty, but a rest parameter will never be undefined.
    This type of function is called variadic functions, variable arity functions, or vararg functions.
    The Arguments Object
    Within the body of any function, the identifier arguments refers to the Arguments object for that invocation.
    function max(x) {
    let maxValue = -Infinity;
    for(let i = 0; i < arguments.length; i++) {
    if (arguments[i] > maxValue)
    maxValue = arguments[i];
    }
    return maxValue;
    }
    max(1, 10, 100, 2, 3, 1000, 4, 5, 6)
    1000
    you should avoid using it in any new code you write.
    The Spread Operator for Function Calls
    let numbers = [5, 2, 10, -1, 9, 100, 1];
    Math.min(...numbers)
    -1
    function timed(f) {
    return function(...args) {
    console.log(Entering function ${f.name});
    let startTime = Date.now();
    try {
    return f(...args);
    }
    finally {
    console.log(Exiting ${f.name} after ${Date.now() - startTime}ms);
    }
    };
    }
    // Compute the sum of the numbers between 1 and n by brute force
    function benchmark(n) {
    let sum = 0;
    for(let i = 1; i <= n; i++) sum += i;
    return sum;
    }
    // Now invoke the timed version of that test function
    timed(benchmark)(1000000)
    Destructuring Function Arguments into Parameters
    function vectorAdd(v1, v2) {
    return [v1[0] + v2[0], v1[1] + v2[1]];
    }
    vectorAdd([1,2], [3,4])
    ←>
    function vectorAdd([x1,y1], [x2,y2]) {
    return [x1 + x2, y1 + y2];
    }
    vectorAdd([1,2], [3,4])
    function vectorMultiply({x, y}, scalar) {
    return { x: xscalar, y: yscalar };
    }
    vectorMultiply({x: 1, y: 2}, 2)
    ←>
    function vectorMultiply({x,y}, scalar) {
    return { x: xscalar, y: yscalar};
    }
    vectorMultiply({x: 1, y: 2}, 2)
    Argument Types
    Adding code to check the types of arguments
    function sum(a) {
    let total = 0;
    for(let element of a) {
    if (typeof element !== "number") {
    throw new TypeError("sum(): elements must be numbers");
    }
    total += element;
    }
    return total;
    }
    sum([1,2,3])
    6
    sum(1, 2, 3);
    TypeError: 1 is not iterable
    sum([1,2,"3"]);
    TypeError: element 2 is not a number
    Functions as Values
    function square(x) { return x * x; }
    let s = square;
    square(4)
    16
    s(4)
    16
    Functions can also be assigned to object properties rather than variables.
    let o = {square: function(x) { return x*x; }};
    let y = o.square(16);
    256
    Functions don’t even require names at all, as when they’re assigned to array elements:
    let a = [x => x*x, 20];
    a[0](a[1])
    400
    a[0] accesses first element of the array, which is “x => x*x”, (a[1]) passes parameter, which is 20.
    Examples of using functions as data
    function add(x,y) { return x + y; }
    function subtract(x,y) { return x - y; }
    function multiply(x,y) { return x * y; }
    function divide(x,y) { return x / y; }
    function operate(operator, operand1, operand2) {
    return operator(operand1, operand2);
    }
    let i = operate(add, operate(add, 2, 3), operate(multiply, 4,5));
    (2+3) + (4*5):
    or:
    const operators = {
    add: (x,y) => x+y,
    subtract: (x,y) => x-y,
    multiply: (x,y) => x*y,
    divide: (x,y) => x/y,
    pow: Math.pow
    };
    function operate2(operation, operand1, operand2) {
    if (typeof operators[operation] === "function") {
    return operators[operation](operand1, operand2);
    }
    else throw "unknown operator";
    }
    operate2("add", "hello", operate2("add", " ", "world"))
    // “hello world”
    operate2("pow", 10, 2)
    100
    Defining Your Own Function Properties
    When a function needs a “static” variable whose value persists across invocations, it is often convenient to use a property of the function itself.
    For example, suppose you want to write a function that returns a unique integer whenever it is invoked. The function must never return the same value twice. In order to manage this, the function needs to keep track of the values it has already returned, and this information must persist across function invocations.
    uniqueInteger.counter = 0;
    function uniqueInteger() {
    return uniqueInteger.counter++;
    }
    uniqueInteger()
    0
    uniqueInteger()
    1
    Compute factorials and cache results as properties of the function itself.
    function factorial(n) {
    if (Number.isInteger(n) && n > 0) {
    if (!(n in factorial)) {
    factorial[n] = n * factorial(n-1);
    }
    return factorial[n];
    }
    else {
    return NaN;
    }
    }
    factorial[1] = 1;
    Initialize the cache to hold this base case.
    factorial(6)
    720
    factorial[5]
    120; the call above caches this value
    Functions as Namespaces
    Variables declared within a function are not visible outside of the function. For this reason, it is sometimes useful to define a function simply to act as a temporary namespace in which you can define variables without cluttering the global namespace.
    Variables that would have been global become local to the function. Following code defines only a single global variable: the function name chunkNamespace.
    function chunkNamespace() {
    // Chunk of code goes here
    // Any variables defined in the chunk are local to this function
    // instead of cluttering up the global namespace.
    }
    chunkNamespace();
    If defining even a single property is too much, you can define and invoke an anonymous function in a single expression — IIEF (immediately invoked function expression)
    (function() {
    // chunkNamespace() function rewritten as an unnamed expression.
    // Chunk of code goes here
    }());
    Closures
    JavaScript uses lexical scoping. This means that functions are executed using the variable scope that was in effect when they were defined, not the variable scope that is in effect when they are invoked.
    In order to implement lexical scoping, the internal state of a JavaScript function object must include not only the code of the function but also a reference to the scope in which the function definition appears.
    This combination of a function object and a scope (a set of variable bindings) in which the function’s variables are resolved is called a closure.
    Closures become interesting when they are invoked from a different scope than the one they were defined in. This happens most commonly when a nested function object is returned from the function within which it was defined.
    let scope = "global scope";
    function checkscope() {
    let scope = "local scope";
    function f() { return scope; }
    return f();
    }
    checkscope()
    “local scope”
    let scope = "global scope";
    function checkscope() {
    let scope = "local scope";
    function f() { return scope; }
    return f;
    }
    let s = checkscope()();
    “local scope”
    Closures capture the local variables of a single function invocation and can use those variables as private state.
    let uniqueInteger = (function() {
    let counter = 0;
    return function() { return counter++; };
    }());
    uniqueInteger()
    0
    uniqueInteger()
    1
    it is the return value of the function that is being assigned to uniqueInteger.
    Private variables like counter need not be exclusive to a single closure: it is perfectly possible for two or more nested functions to be defined within the same outer function and share the same scope.
    function counter() {
    let n = 0;
    return {
    count: function() { return n++; },
    reset: function() { n = 0; }
    };
    }
    let c = counter(), d = counter();
    c.count()
    0
    d.count()
    0
    c.reset();
    c.count()
    0
    d.count()
    1
    You can combine this closure technique with property getters and setters
    function counter(n) {
    return {
    get count() { return n++; },
    set count(m) {
    if (m > n) n = m;
    else throw Error("count can only be set to a larger value")
    }
    };
    }
    let c = counter(1000);
    c.count
    1000
    c.count
    1001
    c.count = 2000;
    c.count
    2000
    c.count = 2000;
    Error: count can only be set to a larger value
    Define a private variable and two nested functions to get and set the value of that variable.
    function addPrivateProperty(o, name, predicate) {
    let value;
    o[get${name}] = function() { return value; };
    o[set${name}] = function(v) {
    if (predicate && !predicate(v)) {
    throw new TypeError(set${name}: invalid value ${v});
    }
    else {
    value = v;
    }
    };
    }
    let o = {};
    addPrivateProperty(o, "Name", x => typeof x === "string");
    o.setName("Frank");
    o.getName()
    “Frank”
    o.setName(0);
    TypeError: try to set a value ofthe wrong type
    Function Properties, Methods, and Constructor
    Since functions are objects, they can have properties and methods, just like any other object.
    The length Property
    The read-only length property of a function specifies the arity of the function — the number of parameters it declares in its parameter list, which is usually the number of arguments that the function expects.
    The name Property
    This property is primarily useful when writing debugging or error messages.
    The prototype Property
    When a function is used as a constructor, the newly created object inherits properties from the prototype object.
    The call() and apply() Methods
    call() and apply() allow you to indirectly invoke a function as if it were a method of some other object. The first argument to both call() and apply() is the object on which the function is to be invoked; this argument is the invocation context and becomes the value of the this keyword within the body of the function.
    To invoke the functionf() as a method of the object o (passing no arguments),
    f.call(o);
    f.apply(o);
    To pass two numbers to the function f() and invoke it as if it were a method of the object o,
    f.call(o, 1, 2);
    The apply() method is like the call() method, except that the arguments to be passed to the function are specified as an array:
    f.apply(o, [1,2]);
    The trace()function defined uses the apply()method instead of a spread operator, and by doing that, it is able to invoke the wrapped method with the same arguments and the same this value as the wrapper method
    function trace(o, m) {
    let original = o[m];
    o[m] = function(...args) {
    console.log(new Date(), "Entering:", m);
    let result = original.apply(this, args);
    console.log(new Date(), "Exiting:", m);
    return result;
    };
    }
    The bind() Method
    The primary purpose of bind() is to bind a function to an object.
    function f(y) { return this.x + y; }
    let o = { x: 1 };
    let g = f.bind(o);
    g(2)
    3
    let p = { x: 10, g };
    p.g(2)
    3 // g is still bound to o, not p.
    The most common use case for calling bind() is to make non-arrow functions behave like arrow functions.
    Partial application is a common technique in functional programming and is sometimes called currying.
    let sum = (x,y) => x + y;
    let succ = sum.bind(null, 1);
    succ(2)
    3
    The toString() Method
    Most (but not all) implementations of this toString() method return the complete source code for the function
    The Function() Constructor
    The Function() constructor is best thought of as a globally scoped version of eval() that defines new variables and functions in its own private scope. You will probably never need to use this constructor in your code.
    Higher-Order Functions
    A higher-order function is a function that operates on functions, taking one or more functions as arguments and returning a new function.
    function not(f) {
    return function(...args) {
    let result = f.apply(this, args);
    return !result;
    };
    }
    const even = x => x % 2 === 0;
    A function to determine if a number is even
    const odd = not(even);
    [1,1,3,5,5].every(odd)
    true
    Returns a new function that maps one array to another
    const map = function(a, ...args) { return a.map(...args); };
    function mapper(f) {
    return a => map(a, f);
    }
    const increment = x => x + 1;
    const incrementAll = mapper(increment);
    incrementAll([1,2,3]
    [2,3,4]
    Example that takes two functions, f and g, and returns a new function that computes f(g()):
    function compose(f, g) {
    return function(...args) {
    return f.call(this, g.apply(this, args));
    };
    }
    const sum = (x,y) => x+y;
    const square = x => x*x;
    compose(square, sum)(2,3)
    25
    Memoization
    We defined a factorial function that cached its previously computed results. In functional programming, this kind of caching is called memoization.
    Classes
    JavaScript’s classes and prototype-based inheritance mechanism are substantially different from the classes and class-based inheritance mechanism of Java.
    Classes and Prototypes
    If we define a prototype object and then use Object.create() to create objects that inherit from it, we have defined a JavaScript class.
    Factory function that returns a new range object:
    function range(from, to) {
    let r = Object.create(range.methods);
    r.from = from;
    r.to = to;
    return r;
    }
    range.methods = {
    includes(x) { return this.from <= x && x <= this.to; },
    *Symbol.iterator {
    for(let x = Math.ceil(this.from); x <= this.to; x++)
    yield x;
    },
    toString() { return "(" + this.from + "..." + this.to +")"; }
    };
    let r = range(1,3);
    r.includes(2)
    true
    r.toString()
    “(1…3)”
    [...r]
    [1, 2, 3]
    Classes and Constructors
    A constructor is a function designed for the initialization of newly created objects.
    The critical feature of constructor invocations is that the prototype property of the constructor is used as the prototype of the new object.
    While almost all objects have a prototype, only a few objects have a prototype property. It is function objects that have a prototype property.
    This means that all objects created with the same constructor function inherit from the same object and are therefore members of the same class.
    A Range class using a constructor
    function Range(from, to) {
    this.from = from;
    this.to = to;
    }
    Range.prototype = {
    includes: function(x) { return this.from <= x && x <= this.to; },
    [Symbol.iterator]: function*() {
    for(let x = Math.ceil(this.from); x <= this.to; x++)
    yield x;
    },
    toString: function() { return "(" + this.from + "..." + this.to + ")"; }
    };
    let r = new Range(1,3);
    r.includes(2)
    true
    r.toString()
    “(1…3)”
    [...r]
    [1, 2, 3]
    Because the Range()constructor is invoked with new, it does not have to call Object.create() or take any action to create a new object.
    In the first example, the prototype was range.methods. This was a convenient and descriptive name, but arbitrary. In the second example, the prototype is Range.prototype, and this name is mandatory.
    An invocation of the Range() constructor automatically uses Range.prototype as the prototype of the new Range object.
    Constructors, Class Identity, and instanceof
    Two objects are instances of the same class if and only if they inherit from the same prototype object.
    The instanceof operator is not checking whether r was actually initialized by the Range constructor. Instead, it is checking whether r inherits from Range.prototype.
    function Strange() {}
    Strange.prototype = Range.prototype;
    new Strange() instanceof Range
    true
    If you want to test the prototype chain of an object for a specific prototype and do not want to use the constructor function as an intermediary, you can use the isPrototypeOf() method
    range.methods.isPrototypeOf(r);
    The constructor Property
    Every regular JavaScript function automatically has a prototype property. The value of this property is an object that has a single, non-enumerable constructor property.
    The value of the constructor property is the function object
    let F = function() {};
    let p = F.prototype;
    let c = p.constructor;
    c === F
    true
    let o = new F();
    o.constructor === F
    true
    Instances of the Range class, as defined, do not have a constructor property. We can remedy this problem by explicitly adding a constructor to the prototype:
    Range.prototype = {
    constructor: Range
    };
    Another common technique that you are likely to see in older JavaScript code is to use the predefined prototype object with its constructor property and add methods to it one at a time with code like this:
    Range.prototype.includes = function(x) {
    return this.from <= x && x <= this.to;
    };
    Range.prototype.toString = function() {
    return "(" + this.from + "..." + this.to + ")";
    };
    Classes with the class Keyword
    class Range {
    constructor(from, to) {
    this.from = from;
    this.to = to;
    }
    includes(x) { return this.from <= x && x <= this.to; }
    *Symbol.iterator {
    for(let x = Math.ceil(this.from); x <= this.to; x++)
    yield x;
    }
    toString() { return (${this.from}...${this.to}); }
    }
    let r = new Range(1,3);
    r.includes(2)
    true
    r.toString()
    (1…3)
    [...r]
    [1, 2, 3]
    Although class bodies are superficially similar to object literals, they are not the same thing. In particular, they do not support the definition of properties with name/value pairs.
    If your class does not need to do any initialization, you can omit the constructor keyword and its body, and an empty constructor function will be implicitly created for you.
    If you want to define a class that subclasses — or inherits from — another class, you can use the extends keyword with the class keyword:
    class Span extends Range {
    constructor(start, length) {
    if (length >= 0) {
    super(start, start + length);
    }
    else {
    super(start + length, start);
    }
    }
    }
    class declarations have both statement and expression forms
    let Square = class { constructor(x) { this.area = x * x; } };
    new Square(3).area
    9
    Static methods
    You can define a static method within a class body by prefixing the method declaration with the static keyword. Static methods are defined as properties of the constructor function rather than properties of the prototype object.
    static parse(s) {
    let matches = s.match(/^ParseError: KaTeX parse error: Undefined control sequence: \d at position 2: (\̲d̲+)\.\.\.(\d+)$/);
    if (!matches) {
    throw new TypeError(Cannot parse Range from &quot;${s}&quot;.)
    }
    return new Range(parseInt(matches[1]),
    parseInt(matches[2]));
    }
    The method defined by this code is Range.parse(), not Range.prototype.parse(), and you must invoke it through the constructor, not through an instance:
    let r = Range.parse('(1...10)');
    Getters, Setters, and other Method Forms
    Within a class body, you can define getter and setter methods just as you can in object literals. The only difference is that in class bodies, you don’t put a comma after the getter or setter.
    Public, Private, and Static Fields
    The ES6 standard only allows the creation of methods (including getters, setters, and generators) and static methods; it does not include syntax for defining fields.
    If you want to define a field on a class instance, you must do that in the constructor function or in one of the methods. And if you want to define a static field for a class, you must do that outside the class body, after the class has been defined.
    Standardization is underway, however, for extended class syntax that allows the definition of instance and static fields, in both public and private forms.
    class Buffer {
    constructor() {
    this.size = 0;
    this.capacity = 4096;
    this.buffer = new Uint8Array(this.capacity);
    }
    }
    ←>
    class Buffer {
    size = 0;
    capacity = 4096;
    buffer = new Uint8Array(this.capacity);
    }
    The same proposal that seeks to standardize these instance fields also defines private (with the # prefix) instance fields.
    class Buffer {
    #size = 0;
    get size() { return this.#size; }
    }
    A related proposal seeks to standardize the use of the static keyword for fields.
    static integerRangePattern = /^\((\d+)\.\.\.(\d+)\)$/;
    static parse(s) {
    let matches = s.match(Range.integerRangePattern);
    if (!matches) {
    throw new TypeError(Cannot parse Range from &quot;${s}&quot;.)
    }
    return new Range(parseInt(matches[1]), matches[2]);
    }
    Adding Methods to Existing Classes
    We can augment JavaScript classes simply by adding new methods to their prototype objects.
    if (!String.prototype.startsWith) {
    String.prototype.startsWith = function(s) {
    return this.indexOf(s) === 0;
    };
    }
    Number.prototype.times = function(f, context) {
    let n = this.valueOf();
    for(let i = 0; i < n; i++) f.call(context, i);
    };
    Subclasses
    Subclasses and Prototypes
    Span subclass of the Range class. This subclass will work just like a Range, but instead of initializing it with a start and an end, we’ll instead specify a start and a distance, or span.
    function Span(start, span) {
    if (span >= 0) {
    this.from = start;
    this.to = start + span;
    }
    else {
    this.to = start;
    this.from = start + span;
    }
    }
    Ensure that the Span prototype inherits from the Range
    Span.prototype = Object.create(Range.prototype);
    We don’t want to inherit Range.prototype.constructor, so we define our own constructor property:
    Span.prototype.constructor = Span;
    Span overrides the toString() method
    Span.prototype.toString = function() {
     return `(${this.from}... +${this.to - this.from})`;
     };
    A robust subclassing mechanism needs to allow classes to invoke the methods and constructor of their superclass, but prior to ES6, JavaScript did not have a simple way to do these things.
    Subclasses with extends and super
    class EZArray extends Array {
    get first() { return this[0]; }
    get last() { return this[this.length-1]; }
    }
    let a = new EZArray();
    a instanceof EZArray
    true
    a instanceof Array
    true
    a.push(1,2,3,4);
    a.pop()
    4
    a.first
    1
    a.last
    3
    Array.isArray(a)
    true
    EZArray.isArray(a)
    true
    Array.prototype.isPrototypeOf(EZArray.prototype
    true
    Array.isPrototypeOf(EZArray)
    true
    Example demonstrates the use of the super keyword to invoke the constructor and methods of the superclass
    class TypedMap extends Map {
    constructor(keyType, valueType, entries) {
    if (entries) {
    for(let [k, v] of entries) {
    if (typeof k !== keyType || typeof v !== valueType) {
    throw new TypeError(Wrong type for entry [${k}, ${v}]);
    }
    }
    }
    super(entries);
    this.keyType = keyType;
    this.valueType = valueType;
    }
    set(key, value) {
    if (this.keyType && typeof key !== this.keyType) {
    throw new TypeError(${key} is not of type${this.keyType});
    }
    if (this.valueType && typeof value !== this.valueType)
    {
    throw new TypeError(${value} is not of type ${this.valueType});
    }
    return super.set(key, value);
    }
    }
    You may not use the this keyword in your constructor until after you have invoked the superclass constructor with super(). This enforces a rule that superclasses get to initialize themselves before subclasses do.
    Once private fields are supported, we could change these properties to #keyType and #valueType so that they could not be altered from the outside.
    Class Hierarchies and Abstract Classes
    Define abstract classes — classes that do not include a complete implementation — to serve as a common superclass for a group of related subclasses.
    Modules
    Automating Closure-Based Modularity
    Imagine a tool that takes a set of files, wraps the content of each of those files within an immediately invoked function expression, keeps track of the return value of each function, and concatenates everything into one big file.
    const modules = {};
    function require(moduleName) { return modules[moduleName]; }
    modules["sets.js"] = (function() {
    const exports = {};
    exports.BitSet = class BitSet { ... };
    return exports;
    }());
    modules["stats.js"] = (function() {
    const exports = {};
    const sum = (x, y) => x + y;
    const square = x = > x * x;
    exports.mean = function(data) { ... };
    exports.stddev = function(data) { ... };
    return exports;
    }());
    writing code like the following to make use of those modules
    const stats = require("stats.js");
    const BitSet = require("sets.js").BitSet;
    // Now write code using those modules
    let s = new BitSet(100);
    s.insert(10);
    s.insert(20);
    s.insert(30);
    let average = stats.mean([...s]);
    Modules in ES6
    ES6 adds import and export keywords to JavaScript and finally supports real modularity as a core language feature.
    ES6 modularity is conceptually the same as Node modularity: each file is its own module, and constants, variables, functions, and classes defined within a file are private to that module unless they are explicitly exported.
    ES6 Exports
    To export a constant, variable, function, or class from an ES6 module, simply add the keyword export before the declaration
    export const PI = Math.PI;
    export function degreesToRadians(d) { return d * PI / 180; }
    export class Circle {
    constructor(r) { this.r = r; }
    area() { return PI * this.r * this.r; }
    }
    or:
    export { Circle, degreesToRadians, PI };
    It is common to write modules that export only one value (typically a function or class), and in this case, we usually use export default instead of export
    export default class BitSet {
    // implementation omitted
    }
    ES6 Imports
    import BitSet from './bitset.js';
    import { mean, stddev } from "./stats.js";
    When importing from a module that defines many exports, however, you can easily import everything with an import statement like this:
    import * as stats from "./stats.js";
    With the wildcard import shown in the previous example, the importing module would use the imported mean() andstddev() functions through the stats object, invoking them as stats.mean() and stats.stddev().
    Note: not finished.
    The JavaScript Standard Library
    The Set Class
    Sets are not ordered or indexed, and they do not allow duplicates.
    let s = new Set();
    let t = new Set([1, s]);
    let t = new Set(s);
    let unique = new Set("Mississippi");
    The argument to the Set() constructor need not be an array: any iterable object (including other Set objects) is allowed.
    The add() method takes a single argument; if you pass an array, it adds the array itself to the set, not the individual array elements. add() always returns the set it is invoked on, however, so if you want to add multiple values to a set, you can used chained method calls like.
    it is very important to understand that set membership is based on strict equality checks, like the === operator performs.
    The most important thing we do with sets is not to add and remove elements from them, but to check to see whether a specified value is a member of the set:
    let oneDigitPrimes = new Set([2,3,5,7]);
    oneDigitPrimes.has(2)
    The Set class is iterable, which means that you can use a for/of loop to enumerate all of the elements of a set:
    let sum = 0;
    for(let p of oneDigitPrimes) {
    sum += p; // and add them up
    }
    Because Set objects are iterable, you can convert them to arrays and argument lists with the … spread operator
    [...oneDigitPrimes]
    JavaScript Set class always remembers the order that elements were inserted in, and it always uses this order when you iterate a set: the first element inserted will be the first one iterated (assuming you haven’t deleted it first), and the most recently inserted element will be the last one iterated.
    Set class also implements a forEach() method
    let product = 1;
    oneDigitPrimes.forEach(n => { product *= n; });
    The Map Class
    let m = new Map();
    let n = new Map("one", 1],["two", 2);
    let copy = new Map(n);
    let o = { x: 1, y: 2};
    let p = new Map(Object.entries(o));
    map is a set of keys, each of which has an associated value. This is not quite the same as a set of key/value pairs.
    use has() to check whether a map includes the specified key; use delete() to remove a key (and its associated value) from the map; use clear() to remove all key/value pairs from the map; and use the size property to find out how many keys a map contains.
    set() method of Map can be chained.
    Any JavaScript value can be used as a key or a value in a Map. This includesnull, undefined, and NaN, as well as reference types like objects and arrays.
    Map compares keys by identity, not by equality.
    let m = new Map();
    m.set({}, 1);
    m.set({}, 2);
    Map a different empty object to the number 2.
    m.get({})
    undefined:
    m.set(m, undefined);
    m.has(m)
    true
    m.get(m)
    undefined
    Iterate over map:
    let m = new Map([["x", 1], ["y", 2]]);
    [...m]
    [[“x”, 1], [“y”, 2]]
    for(let [key, value] of m) {...}
    Map class iterates in insertion order
    If you want to iterate just the keys or just the associated values of a map, use the keys() and values() methods: these return iterable objects that iterate keys and values, in insertion order. (The
     entries() method returns an iterable object that iterates key/value pairs, but this is exactly the same as iterating the map directly.)
    [...m.keys()]
    [...m.values()]
    [...m.entries()]
    Map objects can also be iterated using the forEach()
    m.forEach((value, key) => {...}
    Note that the value parameter comes before the key parameter.
    WeakMap and WeakSet
    The WeakMapclass is a variant (but not an actual subclass) of the Map class that does not prevent its key values from being garbage collected.
    WeakMapkeys must be objects or arrays; primitive values are not subject to garbage collection and cannot be used as keys.
    WeakMap implements only theget(), set(), has(), and delete() methods. In particular, WeakMap is not iterable and does not define keys(), values(), or forEach(). If WeakMap was iterable, then its keys would be reachable and it wouldn’t be weak.
    Similarly, WeakMap does not implement the size property because the size of a WeakMap could change at any time as objects are garbage collected
    Typed Arrays and Binary Data
    They differ from regular arrays in some very important ways
    · The elements of a typed array are all numbers. Unlike regular JavaScript numbers, however, typed arrays allow you to specify the type (signed and unsigned integers and IEEE-754 floating point) and size (8 bits to 64 bits) of the numbers to be stored in the array.
    · You must specify the length of a typed array when you create it, and that length can never change.
    · The elements of a typed array are always initialized to 0 when the array is created.
    Int8Array()
    Uint8Array()
    Uint8ClampedArray()
    Int16Array()
    Uint32Array()
    Uint16Array()
    Int32Array()
    BigInt64Array()
    BigUint64Array()
    Float32Array()
    let bytes = new Uint8Array(1024);
    let matrix = new Float64Array(9);
    let sudoku = new Int8Array(81);
    Initialize with values
    let white = Uint8ClampedArray.of(255, 255, 255, 0);
    let ints = Uint32Array.from(white);
    one more way to create typed arrays that involves the ArrayBuffer type
    let buffer = new ArrayBuffer(1024*1024);
    buffer.byteLength
    1024*1024
    Typed arrays are not true arrays, but they re-implement most array methods, so you can use them pretty much just like you’d use regular arrays:
    let ints = new Int16Array(10);
    10 short integers
    ints.fill(3).map(x=>x*x).join("")
    “9999999999”
    Remember that typed arrays have fixed lengths, so the length property is read-only, and methods that change the length of the array (such aspush(), pop(), unshift(), shift(), and splice()) are not implemented for typed arrays. Methods that alter the contents of an array without changing the length (such as sort(), reverse(), and fill()) are implemented.
    Determine Endianess and DataView
    let littleEndian = new Int8Array(new Int32Array([1]).buffer)
    [0] === 1;
    You can use the DataView class, which defines methods for reading and writing values from an ArrayBuffer with explicitly specified byte ordering. Refer to book for more examples.
    Pattern Matching with Regular Expressions
    RegExp objects may be created with the RegExp() constructor, of course, but they are more often created using a special literal syntax.
    let pattern = /s$/;
    ←>
    let pattern = new RegExp("s$");
    Regular expressions can also have one or more flag characters that affect how they work
    let pattern = /s$/i;
    i = case insensitive
    Punctuation characters have special meanings in regular expressions: ^ $ . * + ? = ! : | \ / ( ) [ ] { }.Other punctuation characters, such as quotation marks and @, do not have special meaning and simply match themselves literally in a regular expression.
    If you use the RegExp() constructor, keep in mind that any backslashes in your regular expression need to be doubled, since strings also use backslashes as an escape character.
    Character
    Matches
    [...]
    Any one character between the brackets.
    [^...]
    Any one character not between the brackets
    .
    Any character except newline or another Unicode line terminator. Or, if the RegExp uses the s flag, then a period matches any character, including line terminators.
    \w
    Any ASCII word character. Equivalent to [a-zA-Z0–9_].
    \W
    Equivalent to [^a-zA-Z0–9_]
    \s
    Any Unicode whitespace character.
    \S
    Any character that is not Unicode whitespace.
    \d
    Equivalent to [0–9].
    \D
    Equivalent to [⁰-9].
    [\b]
    A literal backspace (special case).
    [\s\d]
    Any one whitespace character or digit
    REPETITIONS
    Character
    Meaning
    {n,m}
    Match the previous item at least n times but no more than m times
    {n,}
    Match the previous item n or more times.
    {n}
    Match exactly n occurrences of the previous item.
    ?
    Equivalent to {0,1}.
    +
    Equivalent to {1,}
    *
    Equivalent to {0,}.
    Example
    Description
    let r = /\d{2,4}/;
    Match between two and four digits
    r = /\w{3}\d?/;
    Match exactly three word characters and an optional digit
    r = /\s+java\s+/;
    Match “java” with one or more spaces before and after
    r = /[^(]*/;
    Match zero or more characters that are not open parens
    If you want to match repetitions of more complicated expressions, you’ll need to define a group with parentheses
    Be careful when using the * and ? repetition characters. Since these characters may match zero instances of whatever precedes them, they are allowed to match nothing.
    NON-GREEDY REPETITION
    It is also possible to specify that repetition should be done in a non-greedy way. Simply follow the repetition character or characters with a question mark: ??, +?, *?, or even {1,5}?.
    String
    Pattern
    Match
    "aaa"
    /a+/
    "aaa"
    "aaa"
    /a+?/
    "a"
    Note that using non-greedy repetition may not always produce the results you expect. This is because regular expression pattern matching is done by findingthe first position in the string at which a match is possible. Since a match is possible starting at the first character of the string, shorter matches starting at subsequent characters are never even considered.
    ALTERNATION, GROUPING, AND REFERENCES
    Char
    Pattern
    Pattern
    |
    /ab|cd|ef/
    “ab” or the string “cd” or the string “ef”.
    /\d{3}|[a-z]{4}/
    either three digits or four lowercase letters.
    /a|ab/
    matches only the first letter “a”
    ()
    /java(script)?/
    matches “java” followed by the optional “script”
    /(ab|cd)+|ef/
    matches “java” followed by the optional “script”
    If the left alternative matches, the right alternative is ignored, even if it would have produced a “better” match
    Another purpose of parentheses in regular expressions is to define subpatterns within the complete pattern. When a regular expression is successfully matched against a target string, it is possible to extract the portions of the target string that matched any particular parenthesized subpattern. For example, suppose you are looking for one or more lowercase letters followed by one or more digits. You might use the pattern /[a-z]+\d+/. But suppose you only really care about the digits at the end of each match. If you put that part of the pattern in parentheses (/[a-z]+(\d+)/), you can extract the digits from any matches you find,
    A related use of parenthesized subexpressions is to allow you to refer back to a subexpression later in the same regular expression. This is done by following a \ character by a digit or digits. The digits refer to the position of the parenthesized subexpression within the regular expression. For example, \1 refers back to the first subexpression, and \3 refers to the third.
    Match
    Pattern
    zero or more characters within single or double quotes. However, it does not
     require the opening and closing quotes to match
    /['"][^'"]*['"]/
    To require the quotes to match,use a reference
    /(['"])[^'"]*\1/
    Character
    Meaning

    match either the subexpression to the left or the subexpression to the right.
    (…)
    Grouping: group items into a single unit that can be used with *, +, ?, |, and so on. Also remember the characters that match this group for use with later references
    (?:…)
    group items into a single unit, but do not remember the characters that match this group.
    Note(?:...) syntax:
    In pattern"/([Jj]ava(?:[Ss]cript)?)\sis\s(fun\w*)/" \2 refers to the text matched by (fun\w*) since (?:[Ss]cript)?) in not remembered.
    SPECIFYING MATCH POSITION
    regular expression anchors because they anchor the pattern to a specific position in the search string. The most commonly used anchor elements are ^, which ties the pattern to the beginning of the string, and $, which anchors the pattern to the end of the string.
    Example
    Pattern
    match the word “JavaScript” on a line by itself
    /^JavaScript$/
    To search for “Java” as a word by itself you can try the pattern /\sJava\s/, which requires a space before and after the word. But there are two problems with this solution. First, it does not match “Java” at the beginning or the end of a string, but only if it appears with space on either side. Second, when this pattern does find a match, the matched string it returns has leading and trailing spaces, which is not quite what’s needed. So instead of matching actual space characters with \s, match (or anchor to) word boundaries with \b. The resulting expression is /\bJava\b/.
    The element \B anchors the match to a location that is not a word boundary. Thus, the pattern /\B[Ss]cript/ matches “JavaScript” and “postscript”, but not “script” or “Scripting”.
    You can also use arbitrary regular expressions as anchor conditions.
    If you include an expression within (?= and ) characters, it is a lookahead assertion, and it specifies that the enclosed characters must match, without actually matching them.
    Example
    Pattern
    Matches
    to match the name of a common programming language, but only if it is followed by a colon
    /[Jj]ava([Ss]cript)?(?=\:)/
    matches the word “JavaScript” in “JavaScript: The DefinitiveGuide”
    does not match “Java” in “Java in a Nutshell”
    If you instead introduce an assertion with (?!, it is a negative lookahead assertion.
    FLAGS
    Flags are specified after the second / character of a regular expression literal or as a string passed as the second argument to the RegExp() constructor.
    Flag
    Meaning
    g
    “global” — that is,that we intend to use it to find all matches within a string rather than just finding the first match.it does alter the behavior of the String match() method and the RegExp exec() method in important ways.
    i
    case-insensitive
    m
    “multiline” mode
    s
    useful when working with text that includes newlines.Normally, a “.” in a regular expression matches any character except a line terminator. When the s flag is used, however, “.” will match any character, including line terminators.
    u
    Unicode.
    Setting the u flag on a RegExp also allows you to use the new \u{...} escape sequence for Unicode character and also enables the \p{…} notation for Unicode character classes.
    y
    “sticky”. should match at the beginning of a string or at the first character following the previous match
    String Methods for Pattern Matching
    SEARCH()
    Strings support four methods that use regular expressions.
    "JavaScript".search(/script/ui)
    4
    "Python".search(/script/ui)
    -1
    search() does not support global searches; it ignores the g flag of its regular expression argument.
    REPLACE()
    text.replace(/javascript/gi, "JavaScript");
    No matter how it is capitalized, replace it with the correct capitalization
    parenthesized subexpressions of a regular expression are numbered from left to right and that the regular expression remembers the text that each subexpression matches.
    to replace quotation marks in a string with other characters:
    let quote = /"([^"]*)"/g;
    'He said "stop"'.replace(quote, '«$1»')
    ‘He said «stop»’
    If your RegExp uses named capture groups, then you can refer to the matching text by name rather than by number:
    let quote = /"(?<quotedText>[^"]*)"/g;
    'He said "stop"'.replace(quote, '«$<quotedText>»')
    ‘He said «stop»’
    Instead of passing a replacement string as the second argument to replace(), you can also pass a function that will be invoked to compute the replacement value.
    Example to convert decimal integers in a string to hexadecimal:
    let s = "15 times 15 is 225";
    s.replace(/\d+/gu, n => parseInt(n).toString(16))
    “f times f is e1”
    MATCH()
    "7 plus 8 equals 15".match(/\d+/g)
    [“7”, “8”, “15”]
    If the regular expression does not have the g flag set, match() does not do a global search; it simply searches for the first match. In this nonglobal case, match() still returns an array, but the array elements are completely different.
    Thus, if match() returns an array a, a[0] contains the complete match, a[1] contains the substring that matched the first parenthesized expression, and so on.
    let url = /(\w+):\/\/([\w.]+)\/(\S*)/;
    let text = "Visit my blog at http://www.example.com/~david";
    let match = text.match(url);
    let fullurl, protocol, host, path;
    if (match !== null) {
    fullurl = match[0];
    “http://www.example.com/~david”
    protocol = match[1];
    “http”
    host = match[2];
    “www.example.com”
    path = match[3];
    “~david”
    In this non-global case, the array returned by match() also has some object properties in addition to the numbered array elements.
    input property refers to the string on which match() was called
    The index property is the position within that string at which the match starts.
    if the regular expression contains named capture groups, then the returned array also has a groups property whose value is an object.
    let url = /(?<protocol>\w+):\/\/(?<host>[\w.]+)\/(?<path>\S*)/;
    let text = "Visit my blog at http://www.example.com/~david";
    let match = text.match(url);
    match[0]
    “http://www.example.com/~david”
    match.input
    text
    match.index
    17
    match.groups.protocol
    “http”
    match.groups.host
    “www.example.com”
    match.groups.path
    “~david”
    There are also important but less dramatic differences in behavior when the y flag is set. Refer to book for examples.
    MATCHALL()
    Instead of returning an array of matching substrings like match() does, however, it returns an iterator that yields the kind of match objects that match() returns when used with a non-global RegExp.
    SPLIT()
    "123,456,789".split(",")
    [“123”, “456”,”789"]
    "1, 2, 3,\n4, 5".split(/\s*,\s*/)
    [“1”, “2”, “3”, “4”,”5"]
    Surprisingly, if you call split() with a RegExp delimiter and the regular expression includes capturing groups, then the text that matches the capturing groups will be included in the returned array.
    const htmlTag = /<([^>]+)>/;
    "Testing<br/>1,2,3".split(htmlTag)
    [“Testing”, “br/”,”1,2,3"]
    The RegExp Class
    The RegExp() constructor is useful when a regular expression is being dynamically created and thus cannot be represented with the regular expression literal syntax.
    let zipcode = new RegExp("\\d{5}", "g");
    let exactMatch = /JavaScript/;
     let caseInsensitive = new RegExp(exactMatch, "i");
    TEST()
    Returns true or false by calling exec().
    EXEC()
    let pattern = /Java/g;
    let text = "JavaScript > Java";
    let match;
    while((match = pattern.exec(text)) !== null) {
    console.log(Matched ${match[0]} at ${match.index});
    console.log(Next search begins at ${pattern.lastIndex});
    }
    THE LASTINDEX PROPERTY AND REGEXP REUSE
    The use of the lastIndex property with the g and y flags is a particularly awkward part of this API. When you use these flags, you need to be particularly careful when calling the match(), exec(), or test() methods because the behavior of these methods depends on lastIndex, and the value of lastIndex depends on what you have previously done with the RegExp object.
    To find the index of all <p> tags within a string of HTML text:
    let match, positions = [];
    while((match = /<p>/g.exec(html)) !== null) {
    positions.push(match.index);
    }
    If the html string contains at least one <p> tag, then it will loop forever. For each iteration of the loop, we’re creating a new RegExp object with lastIndex set to 0, so exec() always begins at the start of the string, and if there is a match, it will keep matching over and over. The solution, of course, is to define the RegExp once, and save it to a variable so that we’re using the same RegExp object for each iteration of the loop.
    On the other hand, sometimes reusing a RegExp object is the wrong thing to do. Suppose, for example, that we want to loop through all of the words in a dictionary to find words that contain pairs of double letters.
    let dictionary = [ "apple", "book", "coffee" ];
    let doubleLetterWords = [];
    let doubleLetter = /(\w)\1/g;
    for(let word of dictionary) {
    if (doubleLetter.test(word)) {
    doubleLetterWords.push(word);
    }
    }
    doubleLetterWords
    [“apple”, “coffee”]: “book” is missing!
    Because we set the g flag on the RegExp, the lastIndex property is changed after successful matches, and the test() method (which is based on exec()) starts searching for a match at the position specified by lastIndex. After matching the “pp” in “apple”, lastIndex is 3, and so we start searching the word “book” at position 3 and do not see the “oo” that it contains.
    Dates and Times
    let now = new Date();
    The current time
    let epoch = new Date(0);
    Midnight, January 1st, 1970, GMT
    let century = new Date(2100,
    0,
    1,
    2, 3, 4, 5);
    Year 2100
    January
    1st
    02:03:04.005, local
    let century = new Date(Date.UTC(2100, 0, 1));
    Midnight in GMT, January 1, 2100
    If you print a date (with console.log(century), for example), it will, by default, be printed in your local time zone. If you want to display a date in UTC, you should explicitly convert it to a string with toUTCString() ortoISOString().
    if you pass a string to the Date() constructor, it will attempt to parse that string as a date and time specification
    let century = new Date("2100-01-01T00:00:00Z");
    Once you have a Date object, various get and set methods allow you to query and modify the year, month, day-of-month, hour, minute, second, and millisecond fields of the Date. Each of these methods hastwo forms: one that gets or sets using local time and one that gets or sets using UTC time.
    Note that the methods for querying the day-of-month are getDate() and getUTCDate(). The more natural-sounding functions getDay() and getUTCDay() return the day-of-week (0 for Sunday through 6 for Saturday). The day-of-week is read-only, so there is not a corresponding setDay() method.
    Timestamps
    JavaScript represents dates internally as integers that specify the number of milliseconds since (or before) midnight on January 1, 1970, UTC time.
    For any Date object, the getTime() method returns this internal value, and the setTime() method sets it.
    d.setTime(d.getTime() + 30000);
    add 30 secs
    The static Date.now() method returns the current time as a timestamp and is helpful when you want to measure how long your code takes to run
    let startTime = Date.now();
    reticulateSplines(); // Do some time-consuming operation
    let endTime = Date.now();
    console.log(Spline reticulation took ${endTime -startTime}ms.);
    adds three months and two weeks to the current date:
    let d = new Date();
     d.setMonth(d.getMonth() + 3, d.getDate() + 14);
    Formatting and Parsing Date Strings
    let d = new Date(2020, 0, 1, 17, 10, 30);
    d.toString()
    “Wed Jan 01 2020 17:10:30 GMT-0800 (Pacific Standard Time)”
    d.toUTCString()
    “Thu, 02 Jan 2020 01:10:30 GMT”
    d.toLocaleDateString()
    “1/1/2020”: ‘en-US’ locale
    d.toLocaleTimeString()
    “5:10:30 PM”: ‘en-US’ locale
    d.toISOString()
    “2020–01–02T01:10:30.000Z”
    there is also a static Date.parse() method that takes a string as its argument, attempts to parse it as a date and time, and returns a timestamp representing that date. Date.parse() is able to parse the same strings that the Date() constructor can and is guaranteed to be able to parse the output oftoISOString(), toUTCString(), andtoString().
    Error Classes
    One good reason to use an Error object is that, when you create an Error, it captures the state of the JavaScript stack, and if the exception is uncaught, the stack trace will be displayed with the error message, which will help you debug the issue.
    Error objects have two properties: message and name, and atoString() method. Node and all modern browsers also define a stack property on Error objects.
    Subclasses are EvalError, RangeError, ReferenceError, SyntaxError, TypeError, and URIError.
    You should feel free to define your own Error subclasses that best encapsulate the error conditions of your own program.
    class HTTPError extends Error {
    constructor(status, statusText, url) {
    super(${status} ${statusText}: ${url});
    this.status = status;
    this.statusText = statusText;
    this.url = url;
    }
    get name() { return "HTTPError"; }
    }
    let error = new HTTPError(404, "Not Found", "http://example.com/");
    error.status
    404
    error.message
    “404 Not Found:http://example.com/”
    error.name
    HTTPError
    JSON Serialization and Parsing
    JavaScript supports JSON serialization and deserialization with the two functions JSON.stringify() and JSON.parse().
    let o = {s: "", n: 0, a: [true, false, null]};
    let s = JSON.stringify(o);
    s == ‘{“s”:””,”n”:0,”a”:[true,false,null]}’
    let copy = JSON.parse(s);
    copy == {s: “”, n: 0, a:[true, false, null]}
    Inefficient way of creating a deep copy of an object
    function deepcopy(o) {
    return JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(o));
    }
    Typically, you pass only a single argument to JSON.stringify() and JSON.parse(). Both functions accept an optional second argument that allows us to extend the JSON format.
    JSON.stringify() also takes an optional third argument. If you would like your JSONformatted string to be human-readable (if it is being used as a configuration file, for example), then you should pass null as the second argument and pass a number or string as the third argument. If the third argument is a number, then it will use that number of spaces for each indentation level. If the third argument is a string of whitespace (such as ‘\t’), it will use that string for each level of indent.
    JSON Customizations
    If JSON.stringify() is asked to serialize a value that is not natively supported by the JSON format, it looks to see if that value has a toJSON() method, and if so, it calls that method and then stringifies the return value in place of the original value. Date objects implement toJSON(): it returns the same string that toISOString() method does.
    If you need to re-create Date objects (or modify the parsed object inany other way), you can pass a “reviver” function as the second argument to JSON.parse().
    let data = JSON.parse(text, function(key, value) {
    if (key[0] === "_") return undefined;
    if (typeof value === "string" && /^\d\d\d\d-\d\d-\d\dT\d\d:\d\d:\d\d.\d\d\dZ$/.test(value)) {
    return new Date(value);
    }
    return value;
    });
    The Console API
    Console functions that print their arguments like console.log() have a little-known feature: if the first argument is a string that includes %s, %i, %d, %f, %o, %O, or %c, then this first argument is treated as format string, and the values of subsequent arguments are substituted into the string in place of the two-character % sequences.
    URL API
    let url = new URL("https://example.com:8000/path/name?q=term#fragment");
    url.href
    “https://example.com:8000/path/name?q=term#fragment”
    url.origin
    “https://example.com:8000”
    url.protocol
    “https:”
    url.host
    “example.com:8000”
    url.hostname
    “example.com”
    url.port
    “8000”
    url.pathname
    “/path/name”
    url.search
    “?q=term”
    url.hash
    “#fragment”
    let url = new URL("https://example.com");
    url.pathname = "api/search";
    Add a path to an API endpoint
    url.search = "q=test";
    Add a query parameter
    url.toString()
    “https://example.com/api/search?q=test”
    One of the important features of the URL class is that it correctly adds punctuation and escapes special characters in URLs when that is needed
    let url = new URL("https://example.com");
    url.pathname = "path with spaces";
    url.pathname
    “/path%20with%20spaces”
    url.search = "q=foo#bar";
    url.search
    “?q=foo%23bar”
    url.href
    “https://example.com/path%20with%20spaces?q=foo%23bar”
    Often, however, HTTP requests encode the values of multiple form fields or multiple API parameters into the query portion of a URL. In this format, the query portion of the URL is a question mark followed by one or more name/value pairs, which are separated from one another by ampersands.
    If you want to encode these kinds of name/value pairs into the query portion of a URL, then the searchParams property will be more useful than the search property.
    let url = new URL("https://example.com/search");
    url.search
    “”
    url.searchParams.append("q", "term");
    url.search
    “?q=term”
    url.searchParams.set("q", "x");
    url.search
    “?q=x”
    url.searchParams.append("opts", "1");
    url.search
    “?q=x&opts=1”
    The value of the searchParams property is a URLSearchParams object.
    let url = new URL("http://example.com");
    let params = new URLSearchParams();
    params.append("q", "term");
    params.append("opts", "exact");
    params.toString()
    “q=term&opts=exact”
    url.search = params;
    url.href
    “http://example.com/?q=term&opts=exact”
    Timers
    setTimeout() andsetInterval()—that allow programs to ask the browser to invoke a function after a specified amount of time has elapsed or to invoke the function repeatedly at a specified interval.
    setTimeout(() => { console.log("Ready..."); }, 1000);
    setTimeout(() => { console.log("set..."); }, 2000);
    setTimeout(() => { console.log("go!"); }, 3000);
    If you want to invoke a function repeatedly, use setInterval()
    Both setTimeout() and setInterval() return a value. If you save this value in a variable, you can then use it later to cancel the execution of the function by passing it to clearTimeout() or clearInterval().
    let clock = setInterval(() => {
    console.clear();
    console.log(new Date().toLocaleTimeString());
    }, 1000);
    setTimeout(() => { clearInterval(clock); }, 10000);
    After 10 seconds: stop the repeating code above
    Iterators and Generators
    The iterator method of an iterable object does not have a conventional name but uses the Symbol, Symbol.iterator as its name. So a simple for/of loop over an iterable object iterable could also be written the hard way, like this:
    let iterable = [99];
    let iterator = iterableSymbol.iterator;
    for(let result = iterator.next(); !result.done; result =iterator.next()) {
    console.log(result.value) // result.value == 99
    }
    When you want to iterate though a “partially used” iterator:
    let list = [1,2,3,4,5];
     let iter = list[Symbol.iterator]();
    let head = iter.next().value;
    head == 1
    let tail = [...iter];
    tail == [2,3,4,5]
    Implementing Iterable Objects
    we will implement the Range class one more time, making it iterable without relying on a generator.
    In order to make a class iterable, you must implement a method whose name is the Symbol Symbol.iterator
    class Range {
    constructor (from, to) {
    this.from = from;
    this.to = to;
    }
    has(x) { return typeof x === "number" && this.from <= x && x <= this.to; }
    toString() { return { x | ${this.from} ≤ x ≤ ${this.to}}; }
    Symbol.iterator {
    let next = Math.ceil(this.from);
    let last = this.to;
    return {
    next() {
    return (next <= last) ? { value: next++ } : { done: true };
    },
    Symbol.iterator { return this; }
    };
    }
    }
    for(let x of new Range(1,10)) console.log(x);
    Logs numbers 1 to 10
    [...new Range(-2,2)]
    [-2, -1, 0,1, 2]
    In addition to making your classes iterable, it can be quite useful to define functions that return iterable values.
    Return an iterable object that iterates the result of applying f() to each value from the source iterable
    function map(iterable, f) {
    let iterator = iterableSymbol.iterator;
    return {
    Symbol.iterator { return this; },
    next() {
    let v = iterator.next();
    if (v.done) {
    return v;
    }
    else {
    return { value: f(v.value) };
    }
    }
    };
    }
    [...map(new Range(1,4), x => x*x)]
    [1, 4, 9, 16]
    Return an iterable object that filters the specified iterable, iterating only those elements for which the predicate returns true
    function filter(iterable, predicate) {
    let iterator = iterableSymbol.iterator;
    return {
    Symbol.iterator { return this; },
    next() {
    for(;😉 {
    let v = iterator.next();
    if (v.done || predicate(v.value)) {
    return v;
    }
    }
    }
    };
    }
    [...filter(new Range(1,10), x => x % 2 === 0)]
    [2,4,6,8,10]
    Generators
    Particularly useful when the values to be iterated are not the elements of a data structure, but the result of a computation.
    To create a generator, you must first define a generator function — defined with the keyword function* rather than function
    When you invoke a generator function, it does not actually execute the function body, but instead returns a generator object. This generator object is an iterator.
    Calling its next() method causes the body of the generator function to run from the start (or whatever its current position is) until it reaches a yield statement.
    The value of the yield statement becomes the value returned by the next() call on the iterator.
    function* oneDigitPrimes() {
    yield 2;
    yield 3;
    yield 5;
    yield 7;
    }
    let primes = oneDigitPrimes();
    we get a generator
    primes.next().value
    2
    primes.next().value
    3
    primes.next().value
    5
    primes.next().value
    7
    primes.next().done
    true
    Generators have a Symbol.iterator method to make them iterable
    primes[Symbol.iterator]()
    [...oneDigitPrimes()]
    [2,3,5,7]
    let sum = 0;
    for(let prime of oneDigitPrimes()) sum += prime;
    sum
    17
    Like regular functions, however, we can also define generators in expression form.
    const seq = function*(from,to) {
    for(let i = from; i <= to; i++) yield i;
    };
    [...seq(3,5)]
    [3, 4, 5]
    In classes and object literals, we can use shorthand notation to omit the function keyword entirely when we define methods.
    let o = {
    x: 1, y: 2, z: 3,
    *g() {
    for(let key of Object.keys(this)) {
    yield key;
    }
    }
    };
    [...o.g()]
    [“x”, “y”, “z”, “g”]
    Generators often make it particularly easy to define iterable classes.
    *[Symbol.iterator]() {
    for(let x = Math.ceil(this.from); x <= this.to; x++)
    yield x;
    }
    Generator Examples
    Generators are more interesting if they actually generate the values they yield by doing some kind of computation.
    generator function that yields Fibonacci numbers
    function* fibonacciSequence() {
    let x = 0, y = 1;
    for(;😉 {
    yield y;
    [x, y] = [y, x+y];
    }
    }
    If this generator is used with the … spread operator, it will loop until memory is exhausted and the program crashes.
    Use it in a for/of loop, however
    function fibonacci(n) {
    for(let f of fibonacciSequence()) {
    if (n-- <= 0) return f;
    }
    }
    fibonacci(20)
    10946
    This kind of infinite generator becomes more useful with a take() generator like this
    function* take(n, iterable) {
    let it = iterableSymbol.iterator;
    while(n-- > 0) {
    let next = it.next();
    if (next.done) return;
    else yield next.value;
    }
    }
    [...take(5, fibonacciSequence())]
    [1, 1, 2, 3, 5]
    Asynchronous Javascript
    Promises, new in ES6, are objects that represent the not-yet-available result of an asynchronous operation.
    The keywords async and await were introduced in ES2017 and provide new syntax that simplifies asynchronous programming by allowing you to structure your Promise based code as if it was synchronous.
    Asynchronous iterators and thefor/await loop were introduced in ES2018 and allow you to work with streams of asynchronous events using simple loops that appear synchronous.
    Asynchronous Programming with Callbacks
    Timers
    setTimeout(checkForUpdates, 60000);
    let updateIntervalId = setInterval(checkForUpdates, 60000);
    function stopCheckingForUpdates() {
    clearInterval(updateIntervalId);
    }
    Events
    Event-driven JavaScript programs register callback functions for specified types of events in specified contexts, and the web browser invokes those functions whenever the specified events occur.
    These callback functions are called event handlers or event listeners, and they are registered with addEventListener()
    Ask the web browser to return an object representing the HTML <button> element that matches this CSS selector:
    let okay = document.querySelector('#confirmUpdateDialogbutton.okay');
    Now register a callback function to be invoked when the user clicks on that button
    okay.addEventListener('click', applyUpdate);
    Network Events
    JavaScript running in the browser can fetch data from a web server with code like this:
    function getCurrentVersionNumber(versionCallback) {
    let request = new XMLHttpRequest();
    request.open("GET", "http://www.example.com/api/version");
    request.send();
    request.onload = function() {
    if (request.status === 200) {
    let currentVersion = parseFloat(request.responseText);
    versionCallback(null, currentVersion);
    }
    else {
    versionCallback(response.statusText, null);
    }
    };
    request.onerror = request.ontimeout = function(e) {
    versionCallback(e.type, null);
    };
    }
    Promises
    Promises, a core language feature designed to simplify asynchronous programming.
    A Promise is an object that represents the result of an asynchronous computation. That result may or may not be ready yet, and the Promise API is intentionally vague about this: there is no way to synchronously get the value of a Promise; you can only ask the Promise to call a callback function when the value is ready.
    One real problem with callback-based asynchronous programming is that it is common to end up with callbacks inside callbacks inside callbacks, with lines of code so highly indented that it is difficult to read.
    Promises allow this kind of nested callback to be re-expressed as a more linear Promise chain that tends to be easier to read and easier to reason about.
    Another problem with callbacks is that they can make handling errors difficult. If an asynchronous function (or an asynchronously invoked callback) throws an exception, there is no way for that exception to propagate back to the initiator of the asynchronous operation. This is a fundamental fact about asynchronous programming: it breaks exception handling. Promises help here by standardizing a way to handle errors and providing a way for errors to propagate correctly through a chain of promises.
    Note that Promises represent the future results of single asynchronous computations. They cannot be used to represent repeated asynchronous computations, however.
    We can’t use Promises to replace setInterval() because that function invokes a callback function repeatedly, which is something that Promises are just not designed to do.
    Using Promises
    How we would use this Promise returning utility function
    getJSON(url).then(jsonData => {
    // callback function that will be asynchronously invoked with the parsed JSON value when it becomes available.
    });
    The Promise object defines a then() instance method. Instead of passing our callback function directly to getJSON(), we instead pass it to the then() method. When the HTTP response arrives, the body of that response is parsed as JSON, and the resulting parsed value is passed to the function that we passed to then().
    If you call the then() method of a Promise object multiple times, each of the functions you specify will be called when the promised computation is complete.
    Unlike many event listeners, though, a Promise represents a single computation, and each function registered with then() will be invoked only once.
    function displayUserProfile(profile) { ...}
    getJSON("/api/user/profile").then(displayUserProfile);
    HANDLING ERRORS WITH PROMISES
    Asynchronous operations, particularly those that involve networking, can typically fail in a number of ways, and robust code has to be written to handle the errors that will inevitably occur.
    getJSON("/api/user/profile").then(displayUserProfile, handleProfileError);
    if getJSON() runs normally, it passes its result to displayUserProfile(). If there is an error (the user is not logged in, the server is down, the user’s internet connection dropped, the request timed out, etc.), then getJSON() passes an Error object to handleProfileError().
    In practice, it is rare to see two functions passed to then(). There is a better and more idiomatic way of handling errors when working with Promises.
    To understand it, first consider what happens if getJSON() completes normally but an error occurs in displayUserProfile(). That callback function is invoked asynchronously when getJSON() returns, so it is also asynchronous and cannot meaningfully throw an exception (because there is no code on the call stack to handle it).
    getJSON("/api/user/profile").then(displayUserProfile).catch(handleProfileError);
    With this code, a normal result fromgetJSON() is still passed to displayUserProfile(), but any error in getJSON() or in displayUserProfile() (including any exceptions thrown by displayUserProfile) get passed to handleProfileError().
    Chaining Promises
    One of the most important benefits of Promises is that they provide a natural way to express a sequence of asynchronous operations as a linear chain of then() method invocations, without having to nest each operation within the callback of the previous one.
    fetch(documentURL)
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(document => {return render(document); })
    .then(rendered => {cacheInDatabase(rendered); })
    .catch(error => handle(error));
    has largely been replaced by the newer, Promise-based Fetch API. In its simplest form, this new HTTP API is just the function fetch(). That promise is fulfilled when the HTTP response begins to arrive and the HTTP status and headers are available.
    fetch("/api/user/profile")
    .then(response => {
    if (response.ok &&  response.headers.get("Content-Type") === "application/json") {
    // What can we do here? We don't actually have the response body yet.
    }
    });
    But although the initial Promise is fulfilled, the body of the response may not yet have arrived. So these text() andjson() methods for accessing the body of the response themselves return Promises.
    fetch("/api/user/profile")
    .then(response => {
    return response.json();
    })
    .then(profile => {
    displayUserProfile(profile);
    });
    There is a second then() in the chain, which means that the first invocation of the then() method must itself return a Promise. That is not how Promises work, however.
    When we write a chain of .then() invocations, we are not registering multiple callbacks on a single Promise object. Instead, each invocation of the then() method returns a new Promise object. That new Promise object is not fulfilled until the function passed to then() is complete.
    fetch(theURL)       // task 1; returns promise 1
    .then(callback1)  // task 2; returns promise 2
    .then(callback2); // task 3; returns promise 3
    Resolving Promises
    There is actually a fourth Promise object involved as which brings up the point of what it means for a Promise to be “resolved.”
    fetch() returns a Promise object which, when fulfilled, passes a Response object to the callback function we register. This Response object has .text(), .json(), and other methods to request the body of the HTTP response in various forms. But since the body may not yet have arrived, these methods must return Promise objects.
    “task 2” calls the .json() method and returns its value. This is the fourth Promise object, and it is the return value of the callback1() function.
    Let’s consider:
    function c1(response) {
    let p4 = response.json();
    return p4;
    }
    // callback 1
    // returns promise 4
    function c2(profile) {
    displayUserProfile(profile);
    }
    // callback 2
    let p1 = fetch("/api/user/profile");
    promise 1, task 1
    let p2 = p1.then(c1);
    promise 2, task 2
    let p3 = p2.then(c2);
    promise 3, task 3
    In order for Promise chains to work usefully, the output of task 2 must become the input to task 3. The input to task 3 is the body of the URL that was fetched, parsed as a JSON object. But the return value of callback c1 is not a JSON object, but Promise p4 for that JSON object.
    When p1 is fulfilled, c1 is invoked, and task 2 begins. And when p2 is fulfilled, c2 is invoked, and task 3 begins.
    And when p2 is fulfilled, c2 is invoked, and task 3 begins. But just because task 2 begins when c1 is invoked,it does not mean that task 2 must end when c1 returns.
    Promises are about managing asynchronous tasks, and if task 2 is asynchronous, then that task will not be complete by the time the callback returns.
    When you pass a callback c to the then() method, then() returns a Promise p and arranges to asynchronously invoke c at some later time. The callback performs some computation and returns a value v. When the callback returns, p is resolved with the value v. When a Promise is resolved with a value that is not itself a Promise, it is immediately fulfilled with that value.
    So if c returns a non-Promise, that return value becomes the value of p, p is fulfilled and we are done. But if the return value v is itself a Promise, then p is resolved but not yet fulfilled.
    At this stage, p cannot settle until the Promise v settles. If v is fulfilled, then p will be fulfilled to the same value. If v is rejected, then p will be rejected for the same reason. This is what the “resolved” state of a Promise means
    the Promise has become associated with, or “locked onto,” another Promise. We don’t know yet whether p will be fulfilled or rejected, but our callback c no longer has any control over that. p is “resolved” in the sense that its fate now depends entirely on what happens to Promise v.
    Let’s bring this back to our URL-fetching example. When c1 returns p4, p2 is resolved. But being resolved is not the same as being fulfilled, so task 3 does not begin yet. When the full body of the HTTP response becomes available, then the .json() method can parse it and use that parsed value to fulfill p4. When p4 is fulfilled, p2 is automatically fulfilled as well, with the same parsed JSON value. At this point, the parsed JSON object is passed to c2, and task 3 begins.
    More on Promises and Errors
    With synchronous code, if you leave out error-handling code, you’ll at least get an exception and a stack trace that you can use to figure out what is going wrong. With asynchronous code, unhandled exceptions will often go unreported, and errors can occur silently, making them much harder to debug. The good news is that the .catch() method makes it easy to handle errors when working with Promises.
    THE CATCH AND FINALLY METHODS
    The .catch() method of a Promise is simply a shorthand way to call .then() with null as the first argument and an error-handling callback as the second argument.
    Normal exceptions don’t work with asynchronous code. The .catch() method of Promises is an alternative that does work for asynchronous code.
    fetch("/api/user/profile")
    .then(response => {
    if (!response.ok) {
    return null;
    }
    let type = response.headers.get("content-type");
    if (type !== "application/json") {
    throw new TypeError(Expected JSON, got ${type});
    }
    return response.json();
    })
    .then(profile => {
    if (profile) {
    displayUserProfile(profile);
    }
    else {
    displayLoggedOutProfilePage();
    }
    })
    .catch(e => {
    if (e instanceof NetworkError) {
    displayErrorMessage("Check your internet connection.");
    }
    else if (e instanceof TypeError) {
    displayErrorMessage("Something is wrong with our server!");
    }
    else {
    console.error(e);
    }
    });
    p1 is the Promise returned by the fetch() call
    p2 is the Promise returned by the first .then() call
    c1 is the callback that we pass to that .then() call
    p3 is the Promise returned by the second .then() call
    c2 is the callback we pass to that call
    c3 is the callback that we pass to the .catch() call
    The first thing that could fail is the fetch() request itself. Let’s say p1 was rejected with a NetworkError object.
    We didn’t pass an error-handling callback function as the second argument to the .then() call, so p2 rejects as well with the same NetworkError object.
    Without a handler, though, p2 is rejected, and then p3 is rejected for the same reason.
    At this point, the c3 error-handling callback is called, and the NetworkError-specific code within it runs.
    There are a couple of things worth noting about this code. First, notice that the error object thrown with a regular, synchronous throw statement ends up being handled asynchronously with a .catch() method invocation in a Promise chain. This should make it clear why this shorthand method is preferred over passing a second argument to .then(), and also why it is so idiomatic to end Promise chains with a .catch() call.
    it is also perfectly valid to use .catch() elsewhere in a Promise chain. If one of the stages in your Promise chain can fail with an error, and if the error is some kind of recoverable error that should not stop the rest of the chain from running, then you can insert a .catch() call in the chain, resulting in code that might look like this:
    startAsyncOperation()
    .then(doStageTwo)
    .catch(recoverFromStageTwoError)
    .then(doStageThree)
    .then(doStageFour)
    .catch(logStageThreeAndFourErrors);
    If the callback returns normally, then the .catch() callback will be skipped, and the return value of the previous callback will become the input to the next .then() callback.
    Once an error has been passed to a .catch() callback, it stops propagating down the Promise chain. A .catch() callback can throw a new error, but if it returns normally, than that return value is used to resolve and/or fulfill the associated Promise, and
     the error stops propagating.
    Sometimes, in complex network environments, errors can occur more or less at random, and it can be appropriate to handle those errors by simply retrying the asynchronous request.
    queryDatabase()
    .catch(e => wait(500).then(queryDatabase))
    .then(displayTable)
    .catch(displayDatabaseError);
    Promises in Parallel
    Sometimes,we want to execute a number of asynchronous operations in parallel. The function Promise.all() can do this. Promise.all() takes an array of Promise objects as its input and returns a Promise.
    The returned Promise will be rejected if any of the input Promises are rejected. Otherwise, it will be fulfilled with an array of the fulfillment values of each of the input Promises.
    const urls = [ /* zero or more URLs here */ ];
    promises = urls.map(url => fetch(url).then(r => r.text()));
    Promise.all(promises)
    .then(bodies => { /* do something with the array of strings */ })
    .catch(e => console.error(e));
    The Promise returned by Promise.all() rejects when any of the input Promises is rejected. This happens immediately upon the first rejection and can happen while other input Promises are still pending. In ES2020, Promise.allSettled() takes an array of input
     Promises and returns a Promise, just like Promise.all() does. But Promise.allSettled() never rejects the returned Promise, and it does not fulfill that Promise until all of the input Promises have settled. The Promise resolves to an array of objects, with one object for each input Promise. Each of these returned objects has a status property set to “fulfilled” or “rejected.” If the status is “fulfilled”, then the object will also have a value property that gives the fulfillment value. And if the status is “rejected”, then the object will also have a reason property that gives the error or rejection value of the corresponding Promise.
    Promise.allSettled([Promise.resolve(1), Promise.reject(2),3]).then(results => {
    results[0] // => { status: "fulfilled", value: 1 }
    results[1] // => { status: "rejected", reason: 2 }
    results[2] // => { status: "fulfilled", value: 3 }
    });
    Occasionally, you may want to run a number of Promises at once but may only care about the value of the first one to fulfill. In that case, you can use Promise.race() instead of Promise.all(). It returns a Promise that is fulfilled or rejected when the first of the Promises in the input array is fulfilled or rejected.
    Making Promises
    Promises in Sequence
    async and await
    These new keywords dramatically simplify the use of Promises and allow us to write Promise-based, asynchronous code that looks like synchronous code that blocks while waiting for network responses or other asynchronous events.
    Asynchronous code can’t return a value or throw an exception the way that regular synchronous code can. And this is why Promises are designed the way the are. The value of a fulfilled Promise is like the return value of a synchronous function. And the value of a rejected Promise is like a value thrown by a synchronous function.
    async and await take efficient, Promise-based code and hide the Promises so that your asynchronous code can be as easy to read and as easy to reason about as inefficient, blocking, synchronous code.
    Given a Promise object p, the expression await p waits until p settles. If p fulfills, then the value of await p is the fulfillment value of p. On the other hand, if p is rejected, then the await p expression throws the rejection value of p.
    let response = await fetch("/api/user/profile");
    let profile = await response.json();
    It is critical to understand right away that the await keyword does not cause your program to block and literally do nothing until the specified Promise settles. The code remains asynchronous, and the await simply disguises this fact. This means that any code that uses await is itself asynchronous.
    async Functions
    Because any code that uses await is asynchronous, there is one critical rule: you can only use the await keyword within functions that have been declared with the async keyword.
    async function getHighScore() {
    let response = await fetch("/api/user/profile");
    let profile = await response.json();
    return profile.highScore;
    }
    Declaring a function async means that the return value of the function will be a Promise even if no Promise-related code appears in the body of the function.
    The getHighScore() function is declared async, so it returns a Promise. And because it returns a Promise, we can use the await keyword with it:
    displayHighScore(await getHighScore());
    Awaiting Multiple Promises
    Suppose that we’ve written our getJSON() function using async:
    async function getJSON(url) {
    let response = await fetch(url);
    let body = await response.json();
    return body;
    }
    And now suppose that we want to fetch two JSON values with this function
    let value1 = await getJSON(url1);
    let value2 = await getJSON(url2);
    The problem with this code is that it is unnecessarily sequential: the fetch of the second URL will not begin until the first fetch is complete. If the second URL does not depend on the value obtained from the firstURL, then we should probably try to fetch the two values at the same time.
    let [value1, value2] = await Promise.all([getJSON(url1), getJSON(url2)]);
    The for/await Loop
    Suppose you have an array of URLs:
    const urls = [url1, url2, url3];
    You can call fetch() on each URL to get an array of Promises:
    const promises = urls.map(url => fetch(url));
    We could now usePromise.all() to wait for all the Promises in the array to be fulfilled. But suppose we want the results of the first fetch as soon as they become available and don’t want to wait for all the URLs to be fetched.
    for(const promise of promises) {
    response = await promise;
    handle(response);
    }
    ←>
    for await (const response of promises) {
    handle(response);
    }
    both examples will only work if they are within functions declared async; a for/await loop is no different than a regular await expression in that way

    The ExpressJS Way To Write APIs
    This article will cover the basics of express from the perspective of a beginner without concerning its self with the underlying mechanisms and theory that underlies the application of the framework.



    For starters, what is express JS¿
    When introduced, node.js gave developers the chance to use JavaScript to write software that, up to that point, could only be written using lower level languages like C, C++, Java, Python…
    This tutorial will cover how to write web services that can communicate with clients (the front end application) using JavaScript Object Notation (JSON).

    JavaScript is asynchronous, which allows us to take full advantage of the processor it’s running on. Taking full advantage of the processor is crucial because the node process will be running on a single CPU.
    Using JavaScript gives us access to the npm repository. This repository is the largest ecosystem of useful libraries (most of them free to use) in npm modules.







    Explain what Node.js is and its core features
    Traditionally, developers only used the JavaScript language in web browsers. But, in 2009, Node.js was unveiled, and with it, the developer tool kit expanded greatly. Node.js gave developers the chance to use JavaScript to write software that, up to that point, could only be written using C, C++, Java, Python, Ruby, C#, and the like.
    We will use Node to write server code. Specifically, web services that can communicate with clients using the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format for data interchange.
    Some of the advantages of using Node.js for writing server-side code are:

    Uses the same programming language (JavaScript) and paradigm for both client and server. Using the same language, we minimize context switching and make it easy to share code between the client and the server.
    JavaScript is single-threaded, which removes the complexity involved in handling multiple threads.
    JavaScript is asynchronous, which allows us to take full advantage of the processor it’s running on. Taking full advantage of the processor is crucial because the node process will be running on a single CPU.
    Using JavaScript gives us access to the npm repository. This repository is the largest ecosystem of useful libraries (most of them free to use) in npm modules.

    Some of the disadvantages of using Node.js for writing server-side code are:

    By strictly using JavaScript on the server, we lose the ability to use the right tool (a particular language) for the job.
    Because JavaScript is single-threaded, we can’t take advantage of servers with multiple cores/processors.
    Because JavaScript is asynchronous, it is harder to learn for developers that have only worked with languages that default to synchronous operations that block the execution thread.
    In the npm repository, there are often too many packages that do the same thing. This excess of packages makes it harder to choose one and, in some cases, may introduce vulnerabilities into our code.

    To write a simple web server with Node.js:

    Use Node’s HTTP module to abstract away complex network-related operations.
    Write the single request handler function to handle all requests to the server.

    The request handler is a function that takes the request coming from the client and produces the response. The function takes two arguments: 1) an object representing the request and 2) an object representing the response.
    This process works, but the resulting code is verbose, even for the simplest of servers. Also, note that when using only Node.js to build a server, we use a single request handler function for all requests.



    Try It Out:
    Using only Node.js, let’s write a simple web server that returns a message. Create a folder for the server and add an index.js file inside.
    Next, add the following code to the index.js file:
    const http = require("http"); // built in node.js module to handle http traffic
    const hostname = "127.0.0.1"; // the local computer where the server is running
    const port = 3000; // a port we'll use to watch for traffic
    const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
    // creates our server
    res.statusCode = 200; // http status code returned to the client
    res.setHeader("Content-Type", "text/plain"); // inform the client that we'll be returning text
    res.end("Hello World from Node\n"); // end the request and send a response with the specified message
    });
    server.listen(port, hostname, () => {
    // start watching for connections on the port specified
    console.log(Server running at &lt;http://$&gt;{hostname}:${port}/);
    });
    Now navigate to the folder in a terminal/console window and type: node index.js to execute your file. A message that reads “Server running at http://127.0.0.1:3000” should be displayed, and the server is now waiting for connections.
    Open a browser and visit: http://localhost:3000. localhost and the IP address 127.0.0.1 point to the same thing: your local computer. The browser should show the message: “Hello World from Node”. There you have it, your first web server, built from scratch using nothing but Node.js.



    Explain what Express is and its core features:
    Node’s built-in HTTP module provides a powerful way to build web applications and services. However, it requires a lot of code for everyday tasks like sending an HTML page to the browser.
    Introducing Express, a light and unopinionated framework that sits on top of Node.js, making it easier to create web applications and services. Sending an HTML file or image is now a one-line task with the sendFile helper method in Express.
    Ultimately, Express is just a Node.js module like any other module.
    What can we do with Express? So many things! For example:

    Build web applications.
    Serve Single Page Applications (SPAs).
    Build RESTful web services that work with JSON.
    Serve static content, like HTML files, images, audio files, PDFs, and more.
    Power real-time applications using technologies like Web Sockets or WebRTC.

    Some of the benefits of using Express are that it is:

    Simple
    Unopinionated
    Extensible
    Light-weight
    Compatible with connect middleware (Links to an external site.). This compatibility means we can tap into an extensive collection of modules written for connect.
    All packaged into a clean, intuitive, and easy-to-use API.
    Abstracts away common tasks (writing web applications can be verbose, hence the need for a library like this).

    Some of the drawbacks of Express are:

    It’s not a one-stop solution. Because of its simplicity, it does very little out of the box. Especially when compared to frameworks like Ruby on Rails and Django.
    We are forced to make more decisions due to the flexibility and control it provides.

    Main Features of Express
    Writing middleware for use in Express apps Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object ( req), the response object ( res), and the…expressjs.com



    Middleware
    Middleware functions can get the request and response objects, operate on them, and (when specified) trigger some action. Examples are logging or security.
    Express’s middleware stack is an array of functions.
    Middleware can change the request or response, but it doesn’t have to.
    Routing
    Routing is a way to select which request handler function is executed. It does so based on the URL visited and the HTTP method used. Routing provides a way to break an application into smaller parts.
    Routers for Application Modularity
    We can break up applications into routers. We could have a router to serve our SPA and another router for our API. Each router can have its own middleware and routing. This combination provides improved functionality.
    Convenience Helpers
    Express has many helpers that provide out of the box functionality to make writing web applications and API servers easier.
    A lot of those helpers are extension methods added to the request and response objects.
    Examples from the Api Reference (Links to an external site.) include: response.redirect(), response.status(), response.send(), and request.ip.
    Views
    Views provide a way to dynamically render HTML on the server and even generate it using other languages.



    Try It:
    Let’s write our first server using Express:

    Create a new file called server.js to host our server code.
    Type npm init -y to generate a package.json.
    Install the express npm module using: npm install express.

    Inside server.js add the following code:
    const express = require('express'); // import the express package
    const server = express(); // creates the server
    // handle requests to the root of the api, the / route
    server.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Hello from Express');
    });
    // watch for connections on port 5000
    server.listen(5000, () =>
    console.log('Server running on <http://localhost:5000>')
    );
    Run the server by typing: node server.js and visit http://localhost:5000 in the browser.
    To stop the server, type Ctrl + c at the terminal window.



    Create an API that can respond to GET requests
    The steps necessary to build a simple Web API that returns the string “Hello World” on every incoming GET request. The program should return the string every time a request comes into the root route (“/”). For now, you don’t need to code along, just read through the steps.
    To make things easier, we’ll use an existing repository as the base for our API. Later in the week, as we learn more about Node.js and Express, we’ll create an API from scratch.
    To build our first API, we will:

    clone the node-express-mini repository (Links to an external site.) to a folder on our computer.
    Navigate into the folder using cd.
    Use npm install to download all dependencies.
    Add a file called index.js at the folder’s root, next to the package.json file.
    Open the index.js file using our favorite code editor.
    Add the following code:

    // require the express npm module, needs to be added to the project using "npm install express"
    const express = require('express');

    // creates an express application using the express module
    const server = express();

    // configures our server to execute a function for every GET request to "/"
    // the second argument passed to the .get() method is the "Route Handler Function"
    // the route handler function will run on every GET request to "/"
    server.get('/', (req, res) => {
      // express will pass the request and response objects to this function
      // the .send() on the response object can be used to send a response to the client
      res.send('Hello World');
    });

    // once the server is fully configured we can have it "listen" for connections on a particular "port"
    // the callback function passed as the second argument will run once when the server starts
    server.listen(8000, () => console.log('API running on port 8000'));
    make sure to save your changes to index.js.
    We are using the express npm module in our code, so we need to add it as a dependency to our project. To do this:

    Open a terminal/console/command prompt window and navigate to the root of our project.
    Add express to our package.json file by typing npm install express.

    Now we’re ready to test our API!
    In the terminal, still at the root of our project:

    Type: npm run server to run our API. The message “Api running on port 8000” should appear on the terminal.
    Open a web browser and navigate to “http://localhost:8000”.

    There we have it, our first API!
    A lot is going on in those few lines of code (only six lines if we remove the comments and white space). We will cover every piece of it in detail over the following modules, but here is a quick rundown of the most important concepts.
    First, we used require() to import the express module and make it available to our application. require() is similar to the import keyword we have used before. The line const express = require('express'); is equivalent to import express from 'express'; if we were using ES2015 syntax.
    The following line creates our Express application. The return of calling express() is an instance of an Express application that we can use to configure our server and, eventually, start listening for and responding to requests. Notice we use the word server, not API. An Express application is generic, which means we can use it to serve static content (HTML, CSS, audio, video, PDFs, and more). We can also use an Express application to serve dynamically generated web pages, build real-time communications servers, and more. We will use it statically to accept requests from clients and respond with data in JSON format.
    An Express application publishes a set of methods we can use to configure functions. We are using the .get() method to set up a route handler function that will run on every GET request. As a part of this handler function, we specify the URL which will trigger the request. In this case, the URL is the site’s root (represented by a /). There are also methods to handle the POST, PUT, and DELETE HTTP verbs.
    The first two arguments passed by express to a route handler function are 1) an object representing the request and 2) an object representing the response. Express expands those objects with a set of useful properties and methods. Our example uses the .send() method of the response object to specify the data we will send to the client as the response body. You can call the first two arguments anything you want, but it is prevalent to see them dubbed req and res.
    That’s all the configuring we need to do for this first example We’ll see other ways of configuring our server as we go forward.
    After configuring the server, it’s time to turn it on. We use the .listen() method to monitor a port on the computer for any incoming connections and respond to those we have configured. Our server will only respond to GET requests made to the / route on port 8000.
    That’s it for our first Web API, and now it’s time for you to follow along as we add a new endpoint to our server that returns JSON data!



    Try It Out:
    Let’s try returning JSON instead of just a simple string.
    Please follow the steps outlined on the overview, but, to save time, copy and paste the content of index.js instead of typing it. Then run your API through a browser to make sure it works.
    Now follow along as we code a new endpoint that returns an array of movie characters in JSON format.
    The first step is to define a new route handler to respond to GET requests at the /hobbits endpoint.
    server.get('/hobbits', (req, res) => {
      // route handler code here
    });
    Next, we define the return data that our endpoint will send back to the client. We do this inside the newly defined route handler function.
    const hobbits = [
      {
        id: 1,
        name: 'Samwise Gamgee',
      },
      {
        id: 2,
        name: 'Frodo Baggins',
      },
    ];
    Now we can return the hobbits array. We could use .send(hobbits) as we did for the string on the / endpoint, but this time we’ll learn about two other useful methods we find in the response object.
    res.status(200).json(hobbits);
    We should provide as much useful information as possible to the clients using our API. One such piece of data is the HTTP status code that reflects the client’s operation outcome. In this case, the client is trying to get a list of a particular resource, a hobbits list. Sending back a 200 OK status code communicates to the client that the operation was successful.
    We will see other status codes as we continue to build new endpoints during this week. You can see a list by following this link to the documentation about HTTP Response Codes on the Mozilla Developer Network site (Links to an external site.).
    We can use the .status() method of the response object to send any valid HTTP status code.
    We are also chaining the .json() method of the response object. We do this to communicate to both the client making the request and the next developer working with this code that we intend to send the data in JSON format.
    The complete code for index.js should now look like so:
    const express = require('express');
    const server = express();
    server.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Hello World');
    });
    server.get('/hobbits', (req, res) => {
    const hobbits = [
    {
    id: 1,
    name: 'Samwise Gamgee',
    },
    {
    id: 2,
    name: 'Frodo Baggins',
    },
    ];
    res.status(200).json(hobbits);
    });
    server.listen(8000, () => console.log('API running on port 8000'));
    Now we can visit http://localhost:8000/hobbits in our browser, and we should get back our JSON array.
    If you are using the Google Chrome browser, this extension (Links to an external site.) can format the JSON data in a more readable fashion.
    Congratulations! You just built an API that can return data in JSON format.



    Let’s look at a basic example of routing in action.
    First, to make our Express application respond to GET requests on different URLs, add the following endpoints:
    // this request handler executes when making a GET request to /about
    server.get('/about', (req, res) => {
      res.status(200).send('<h1>About Us</h1>');
    });
    // this request handler executes when making a GET request to /contact
    server.get('/contact', (req, res) => {
    res.status(200).send('<h1>Contact Form</h1>');
    });
    Two things to note:

    1.) We are using the same HTTP Method on both endpoints, but express looks at the URL and executes the corresponding request handler.


    2.) We can return a string with valid HTML!

    Open a browser and navigate to the /about and /contact routes. The appropriate route handler will execute.
    Please follow along as we write endpoints that execute different request handlers on the same URL by changing the HTTP method.
    Let’s start by adding the following code after the GET endpoint to /hobbits:
    // this request handler executes when making a POST request to /hobbits
    server.post('/hobbits', (req, res) => {
      res.status(201).json({ url: '/hobbits', operation: 'POST' });
    });
    Note that we return HTTP status code 201 (created) for successful POST operations.
    Next, we need to add an endpoint for PUT requests to the same URL.
    // this request handler executes when making a PUT request to /hobbits
    server.put('/hobbits', (req, res) => {
      res.status(200).json({ url: '/hobbits', operation: 'PUT' });
    });
    For successful PUT operations, we use HTTP Status Code 200 (OK).
    Finally, let’s write an endpoint to handle DELETE requests.
    // this request handler executes when making a DELETE request to /hobbits
    server.delete('/hobbits', (req, res) => {
      res.status(204);
    });
    We are returning HTTP Status Code 204 (No Content). Suppose you are returning any data to the client, perhaps the removed resource, on successful deletes. In that case, you’d change that to be 200 instead.
    You may have noticed that we are not reading any data from the request, as that is something we’ll learn later in the module. We are about to learn how to use a tool called Postman to test our POST, PUT, and DELETE endpoints.



    Reading and Using Route Parameters
    Let’s revisit our DELETE endpoint.
    server.delete('/hobbits', (req, res) => {
      res.status(204);
    });
    How does the client let the API know which hobbit should be deleted or updated? One way, the one we’ll use, is through route parameters. Let’s add support for route parameters to our DELETE endpoint.
    We define route parameters by adding it to the URL with a colon (:) in front of it. Express adds it to the .params property part of the request object. Let’s see it in action:
    server.delete('/hobbits/:id', (req, res) => {
      const id = req.params.id;
      // or we could destructure it like so: const { id } = req.params;
      res.status(200).json({
        url: `/hobbits/${id}`,
        operation: `DELETE for hobbit with id ${id}`,
      });
    });
    This route handler will execute every DELETE for a URL that begins with /hobbits/ followed by any value. So, DELETE requests to /hobbits/123 and /hobbits/frodo will both trigger this request handler. The value passed after /hobbits/ will end up as the id property on req.params.
    The value for a route parameter will always be string, even if the value passed is numeric. When hitting /hobbits/123 in our example, the type of req.params.id will be string.
    Express routing has support for multiple route parameters. For example, defining a route URL that reads /hobbits/:id/friends/:friendId, will add properties for id and friendId to req.params.



    Using the Query String
    The query string is another strategy using the URL to pass information from clients to the server. The query string is structured as a set of key/value pairs. Each pair takes the form of key=value, and pairs are separated by an &. To mark the beginning of the query string, we add ? and the end of the URL, followed by the set of key/value pairs.
    An example of a query string would be: https://www.google.com/search?q=lambda&tbo=1. The query string portion is ?q=lambda&tbo=1 and the key/value pairs are q=lambda and tbo=1.
    Let’s add sorting capabilities to our API. We’ll provide a way for clients to hit our /hobbits and pass the field they want to use to sort the responses, and our API will sort the data by that field in ascending order.
    Here’s the new code for the GET /hobbits endpoint:
    server.get('/hobbits', (req, res) => {
      // query string parameters get added to req.query
      const sortField = req.query.sortby || 'id';
      const hobbits = [
        {
          id: 1,
          name: 'Samwise Gamgee',
        },
        {
          id: 2,
          name: 'Frodo Baggins',
        },
      ];
    // apply the sorting
    const response = hobbits.sort(
    (a, b) => (a[sortField] < b[sortField] ? -1 : 1)
    );
    res.status(200).json(response);
    });
    Visit localhost:8000/hobbits?sortby=name, and the list should be sorted by name. Visit localhost:8000/hobbits?sortby=id, and the list should now be sorted by id. If no sortby parameter is provided, it should default to sorting by id.
    To read values from the query string, we use the req.query object added by Express. There will be a key and a value in the req.query object for each key/value pair found in the query string.
    The parameter’s value will be of type array if more than one value is passed for the same key and string when only one value is passed. For example, in the query string ?id=123, req.query.id will be a string, but for ?id=123&id=234, it will be an array.
    Another gotcha is that the names of query string parameters are case sensitive, sortby and sortBy are two different parameters.
    The rest of the code sorts the array before sending it back to the client.



    Reading Data from the Request Body
    We begin by taking another look at the POST /hobbits endpoint. We need to read the hobbit’s information to add it to the hobbits array. Let’s do that next:
    // add this code right after const server = express();
    server.use(express.json());
    let hobbits = [
    {
    id: 1,
    name: 'Bilbo Baggins',
    age: 111,
    },
    {
    id: 2,
    name: 'Frodo Baggins',
    age: 33,
    },
    ];
    let nextId = 3;
    // and modify the post endpoint like so:
    server.post('/hobbits', (req, res) => {
    const hobbit = req.body;
    hobbit.id = nextId++;
    hobbits.push(hobbit);
    res.status(201).json(hobbits);
    });
    To make this work with the hobbits array, we first move it out of the get endpoint into the outer scope. Now we have access to it from all route handlers.
    Then we define a variable for manual id generation. When using a database, this is not necessary as the database management system generates ids automatically.
    To read data from the request body, we need to do two things:

    Add the line: server.use(express.json()); after the express application has been created.
    Read the data from the body property that Express adds to the request object. Express takes all the client’s information from the body and makes it available as a nice JavaScript object.

    Note that we are skipping data validation to keep this demo simple, but in a production application, you would validate before attempting to save to the database.
    Let’s test it using Postman:

    Change the method to POST.
    Select the Body tab underneath the address bar.
    Click on the raw radio button.
    From the dropdown menu to the right of the binary radio button, select `JSON (application/json).
    Add the following JSON object as the body:

    {
      "name": "Samwise Gamgee",
      "age": 30
    }
    Click on Send, and the API should return the list of hobbits, including Sam!



    Try It:
    Please code along as we implement the PUT endpoint and a way for the client to specify the sort direction.
    Implement Update Functionality
    Let’s continue practicing reading route parameters and information from the request body. Let’s take a look at our existing PUT endpoint:
    server.put('/hobbits', (req, res) => {
      res.status(200).json({ url: '/hobbits', operation: 'PUT' });
    });
    We start by adding support for a route parameter the clients can use to specify the id of the hobbit they intend to update:
    server.put('/hobbits/:id', (req, res) => {
      res.status(200).json({ url: '/hobbits', operation: 'PUT' });
    });
    Next, we read the hobbit information from the request body using req.body and use it to update the existing hobbit.
    server.put('/hobbits/:id', (req, res) => {
      const hobbit = hobbits.find(h => h.id == req.params.id);
    if (!hobbit) {
    res.status(404).json({ message: 'Hobbit does not exist' });
    } else {
    // modify the existing hobbit
    Object.assign(hobbit, req.body);
    res.status(200).json(hobbit);

    }
    });
    Concentrate on the code related to reading the id from the req.params object and reading the hobbit information from req.body. The rest of the code will change as this is a simple example using an in-memory array. Most production APIs will use a database.

    Update(Bonus Best Practices):
    Things to do in your code
    Here are some things you can do in your code to improve your application’s performance:

    Use gzip compression
    Don’t use synchronous functions
    Do logging correctly
    Handle exceptions properly

    Use gzip compression
    Gzip compressing can greatly decrease the size of the response body and hence increase the speed of a web app. Use the compression middleware for gzip compression in your Express app. For example:
    var compression = require('compression')
    var express = require('express')
    var app = express()
    app.use(compression())
    For a high-traffic website in production, the best way to put compression in place is to implement it at a reverse proxy level (see Use a reverse proxy). In that case, you do not need to use compression middleware. For details on enabling gzip compression in Nginx, see Module ngx_http_gzip_module in the Nginx documentation.
    Don’t use synchronous functions
    Synchronous functions and methods tie up the executing process until they return. A single call to a synchronous function might return in a few microseconds or milliseconds, however in high-traffic websites, these calls add up and reduce the performance of the app. Avoid their use in production.
    Although Node and many modules provide synchronous and asynchronous versions of their functions, always use the asynchronous version in production. The only time when a synchronous function can be justified is upon initial startup.
    If you are using Node.js 4.0+ or io.js 2.1.0+, you can use the --trace-sync-io command-line flag to print a warning and a stack trace whenever your application uses a synchronous API. Of course, you wouldn’t want to use this in production, but rather to ensure that your code is ready for production. See the node command-line options documentation for more information.
    Do logging correctly
    In general, there are two reasons for logging from your app: For debugging and for logging app activity (essentially, everything else). Using console.log() or console.error() to print log messages to the terminal is common practice in development. But these functions are synchronous when the destination is a terminal or a file, so they are not suitable for production, unless you pipe the output to another program.
    For debugging
    If you’re logging for purposes of debugging, then instead of using console.log(), use a special debugging module like debug. This module enables you to use the DEBUG environment variable to control what debug messages are sent to console.error(), if any. To keep your app purely asynchronous, you’d still want to pipe console.error() to another program. But then, you’re not really going to debug in production, are you?
    For app activity
    If you’re logging app activity (for example, tracking traffic or API calls), instead of using console.log(), use a logging library like Winston or Bunyan. For a detailed comparison of these two libraries, see the StrongLoop blog post Comparing Winston and Bunyan Node.js Logging.
    Handle exceptions properly
    Node apps crash when they encounter an uncaught exception. Not handling exceptions and taking appropriate actions will make your Express app crash and go offline. If you follow the advice in Ensure your app automatically restarts below, then your app will recover from a crash. Fortunately, Express apps typically have a short startup time. Nevertheless, you want to avoid crashing in the first place, and to do that, you need to handle exceptions properly.
    To ensure you handle all exceptions, use the following techniques:

    Use try-catch
    Use promises

    Before diving into these topics, you should have a basic understanding of Node/Express error handling: using error-first callbacks, and propagating errors in middleware. Node uses an “error-first callback” convention for returning errors from asynchronous functions, where the first parameter to the callback function is the error object, followed by result data in succeeding parameters. To indicate no error, pass null as the first parameter. The callback function must correspondingly follow the error-first callback convention to meaningfully handle the error. And in Express, the best practice is to use the next() function to propagate errors through the middleware chain.
    For more on the fundamentals of error handling, see:

    Error Handling in Node.js
    Building Robust Node Applications: Error Handling (StrongLoop blog)

    What not to do
    One thing you should not do is to listen for the uncaughtException event, emitted when an exception bubbles all the way back to the event loop. Adding an event listener for uncaughtException will change the default behavior of the process that is encountering an exception; the process will continue to run despite the exception. This might sound like a good way of preventing your app from crashing, but continuing to run the app after an uncaught exception is a dangerous practice and is not recommended, because the state of the process becomes unreliable and unpredictable.
    Additionally, using uncaughtException is officially recognized as crude. So listening for uncaughtException is just a bad idea. This is why we recommend things like multiple processes and supervisors: crashing and restarting is often the most reliable way to recover from an error.
    We also don’t recommend using domains. It generally doesn’t solve the problem and is a deprecated module.
    Use try-catch
    Try-catch is a JavaScript language construct that you can use to catch exceptions in synchronous code. Use try-catch, for example, to handle JSON parsing errors as shown below.
    Use a tool such as JSHint or JSLint to help you find implicit exceptions like reference errors on undefined variables.
    Here is an example of using try-catch to handle a potential process-crashing exception. This middleware function accepts a query field parameter named “params” that is a JSON object.
    app.get('/search', function (req, res) {
      // Simulating async operation
      setImmediate(function () {
        var jsonStr = req.query.params
        try {
          var jsonObj = JSON.parse(jsonStr)
          res.send('Success')
        } catch (e) {
          res.status(400).send('Invalid JSON string')
        }
      })
    })
    However, try-catch works only for synchronous code. Because the Node platform is primarily asynchronous (particularly in a production environment), try-catch won’t catch a lot of exceptions.
    Use promises
    Promises will handle any exceptions (both explicit and implicit) in asynchronous code blocks that use then(). Just add .catch(next) to the end of promise chains. For example:
    app.get('/', function (req, res, next) {
      // do some sync stuff
      queryDb()
        .then(function (data) {
          // handle data
          return makeCsv(data)
        })
        .then(function (csv) {
          // handle csv
        })
        .catch(next)
    })
    app.use(function (err, req, res, next) {
    // handle error
    })
    Now all errors asynchronous and synchronous get propagated to the error middleware.
    However, there are two caveats:

    All your asynchronous code must return promises (except emitters). If a particular library does not return promises, convert the base object by using a helper function like Bluebird.promisifyAll().
    Event emitters (like streams) can still cause uncaught exceptions. So make sure you are handling the error event properly; for example:
    const wrap = fn => (…args) => fn(…args).catch(args[2])
    app.get(‘/’, wrap(async (req, res, next) => { const company = await getCompanyById(req.query.id) const stream = getLogoStreamById(company.id) stream.on(‘error’, next).pipe(res) }))

    The wrap() function is a wrapper that catches rejected promises and calls next() with the error as the first argument. For details, see Asynchronous Error Handling in Express with Promises, Generators and ES7.
    For more information about error-handling by using promises, see Promises in Node.js with Q — An Alternative to Callbacks.
    Things to do in your environment / setup
    Here are some things you can do in your system environment to improve your app’s performance:

    Set NODE_ENV to “production”
    Ensure your app automatically restarts
    Run your app in a cluster
    Cache request results
    Use a load balancer
    Use a reverse proxy

    Set NODE_ENV to “production”
    The NODE_ENV environment variable specifies the environment in which an application is running (usually, development or production). One of the simplest things you can do to improve performance is to set NODE_ENV to “production.”
    Setting NODE_ENV to “production” makes Express:

    Cache view templates.
    Cache CSS files generated from CSS extensions.
    Generate less verbose error messages.

    Tests indicate that just doing this can improve app performance by a factor of three!
    If you need to write environment-specific code, you can check the value of NODE_ENV with process.env.NODE_ENV. Be aware that checking the value of any environment variable incurs a performance penalty, and so should be done sparingly.
    In development, you typically set environment variables in your interactive shell, for example by using export or your .bash_profile file. But in general you shouldn’t do that on a production server; instead, use your OS’s init system (systemd or Upstart). The next section provides more details about using your init system in general, but setting NODE_ENV is so important for performance (and easy to do), that it’s highlighted here.
    With Upstart, use the env keyword in your job file. For example:
    # /etc/init/env.conf
     env NODE_ENV=production
    For more information, see the Upstart Intro, Cookbook and Best Practices.
    With systemd, use the Environment directive in your unit file. For example:
    # /etc/systemd/system/myservice.service
    Environment=NODE_ENV=production
    For more information, see Using Environment Variables In systemd Units.
    Ensure your app automatically restarts
    In production, you don’t want your application to be offline, ever. This means you need to make sure it restarts both if the app crashes and if the server itself crashes. Although you hope that neither of those events occurs, realistically you must account for both eventualities by:

    Using a process manager to restart the app (and Node) when it crashes.
    Using the init system provided by your OS to restart the process manager when the OS crashes. It’s also possible to use the init system without a process manager.

    Node applications crash if they encounter an uncaught exception. The foremost thing you need to do is to ensure your app is well-tested and handles all exceptions (see handle exceptions properly for details). But as a fail-safe, put a mechanism in place to ensure that if and when your app crashes, it will automatically restart.
    Use a process manager
    In development, you started your app simply from the command line with node server.js or something similar. But doing this in production is a recipe for disaster. If the app crashes, it will be offline until you restart it. To ensure your app restarts if it crashes, use a process manager. A process manager is a “container” for applications that facilitates deployment, provides high availability, and enables you to manage the application at runtime.
    In addition to restarting your app when it crashes, a process manager can enable you to:

    Gain insights into runtime performance and resource consumption.
    Modify settings dynamically to improve performance.
    Control clustering (StrongLoop PM and pm2).

    The most popular process managers for Node are as follows:

    StrongLoop Process Manager
    PM2
    Forever

    For a feature-by-feature comparison of the three process managers, see http://strong-pm.io/compare/. For a more detailed introduction to all three, see Process managers for Express apps.
    Using any of these process managers will suffice to keep your application up, even if it does crash from time to time.
    However, StrongLoop PM has lots of features that specifically target production deployment. You can use it and the related StrongLoop tools to:

    Build and package your app locally, then deploy it securely to your production system.
    Automatically restart your app if it crashes for any reason.
    Manage your clusters remotely.
    View CPU profiles and heap snapshots to optimize performance and diagnose memory leaks.
    View performance metrics for your application.
    Easily scale to multiple hosts with integrated control for Nginx load balancer.

    As explained below, when you install StrongLoop PM as an operating system service using your init system, it will automatically restart when the system restarts. Thus, it will keep your application processes and clusters alive forever.
    Cache request results
    Another strategy to improve the performance in production is to cache the result of requests, so that your app does not repeat the operation to serve the same request repeatedly.
    Use a caching server like Varnish or Nginx (see also Nginx Caching) to greatly improve the speed and performance of your app.
    Use a load balancer
    No matter how optimized an app is, a single instance can handle only a limited amount of load and traffic. One way to scale an app is to run multiple instances of it and distribute the traffic via a load balancer. Setting up a load balancer can improve your app’s performance and speed, and enable it to scale more than is possible with a single instance.
    A load balancer is usually a reverse proxy that orchestrates traffic to and from multiple application instances and servers. You can easily set up a load balancer for your app by using Nginx or HAProxy.
    With load balancing, you might have to ensure that requests that are associated with a particular session ID connect to the process that originated them. This is known as session affinity, or sticky sessions, and may be addressed by the suggestion above to use a data store such as Redis for session data (depending on your application). For a discussion, see Using multiple nodes.
    Use a reverse proxy
    A reverse proxy sits in front of a web app and performs supporting operations on the requests, apart from directing requests to the app. It can handle error pages, compression, caching, serving files, and load balancing among other things.
    Handing over tasks that do not require knowledge of application state to a reverse proxy frees up Express to perform specialized application tasks. For this reason, it is recommended to run Express behind a reverse proxy like Nginx or HAProxy in production.

    Python:

    Python is an interpreted, high-level and general-purpose, dynamically typed programming language
    It is also Object oriented, modular oriented and a scripting language.
    In Python, everything is considered as an Object.
    A python file has an extension of .py
    Python follows Indentation to separate code blocks instead of flower brackets({}).
    We can run a python file by the following command in cmd(Windows) or shell(mac/linux).
    python <filename.py>

    By default, the python doesn’t require any imports to run a python file.
    Create and execute a program

    Open up a terminal/cmd
    Create the program: nano/cat > nameProgram.py
    Write the program and save it

    Basic Datatypes



    Keywords



    Operators






    Basic Data Structures
    List

    List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.
    Lists are created using square brackets:

    thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

    List items are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values.
    List items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc.
    The list is changeable, meaning that we can change, add, and remove items in a list after it has been created.
    To determine how many items a list has, use the len() function.
    A list can contain different data types:

    list1 = ["abc", 34, True, 40, "male"]

    It is also possible to use the list() constructor when creating a new list

    thislist = list(("apple", "banana", "cherry"))  # note the double round-brackets
    Tuple

    Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
    A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable.
    Tuples are written with round brackets.

    thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")

    Tuple items are ordered, unchangeable, and allow duplicate values.
    Tuple items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc.
    When we say that tuples are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.
    Tuples are unchangeable, meaning that we cannot change, add or remove items after the tuple has been created.
    Since tuple are indexed, tuples can have items with the same value:
    Tuples allow duplicate values:

    thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple", "cherry")

    To determine how many items a tuple has, use the len()function:

    thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
    print(len(thistuple))

    To create a tuple with only one item, you have to add a comma after the item, otherwise Python will not recognize it as a tuple.

    thistuple = ("apple",)
    print(type(thistuple))

    #NOT a tuple
    thistuple = ("apple")
    print(type(thistuple))

    It is also possible to use the tuple() constructor to make a tuple.

    thistuple = tuple(("apple", "banana", "cherry")) # note the double round-brackets
    print(thistuple)
    Set

    Set is a collection which is unordered and unindexed. No duplicate members.
    A set is a collection which is both unordered and unindexed.

    thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}

    Set items are unordered, unchangeable, and do not allow duplicate values.
    Unordered means that the items in a set do not have a defined order.
    Set items can appear in a different order every time you use them, and cannot be referred to by index or key.
    Sets are unchangeable, meaning that we cannot change the items after the set has been created.
    Duplicate values will be ignored.
    To determine how many items a set has, use the len() method.

    thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}

    print(len(thisset))

    Set items can be of any data type:

    set1 = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
    set2 = {1, 5, 7, 9, 3}
    set3 = {True, False, False}
    set4 = {"abc", 34, True, 40, "male"}

    It is also possible to use the set() constructor to make a set.

    thisset = set(("apple", "banana", "cherry")) # note the double round-brackets
    Dictionary

    Dictionary is a collection which is unordered and changeable. No duplicate members.
    Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs.
    Dictionaries are written with curly brackets, and have keys and values:

    thisdict = {
      "brand": "Ford",
      "model": "Mustang",
      "year": 1964
    }

    Dictionary items are presented in key:value pairs, and can be referred to by using the key name.

    thisdict = {
      "brand": "Ford",
      "model": "Mustang",
      "year": 1964
    }
    print(thisdict["brand"])

    Dictionaries are changeable, meaning that we can change, add or remove items after the dictionary has been created.
    Dictionaries cannot have two items with the same key.
    Duplicate values will overwrite existing values.
    To determine how many items a dictionary has, use the len() function.

    print(len(thisdict))

    The values in dictionary items can be of any data type

    thisdict = {
      "brand": "Ford",
      "electric": False,
      "year": 1964,
      "colors": ["red", "white", "blue"]
    }
    Conditional branching
    if condition:
            pass
        elif condition2:
            pass
        else:
            pass
    Loops
    Python has two primitive loop commands:

    while loops
    for loops

    While loop

    With the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.
    Example: Print i as long as i is less than 6

    i = 1
    while i < 6:
      print(i)
      i += 1

    The while loop requires relevant variables to be ready, in this example we need to define an indexing variable, i, which we set to 1.
    With the break statement we can stop the loop even if the while condition is true
    With the continue statement we can stop the current iteration, and continue with the next.
    With the else statement we can run a block of code once when the condition no longer is true.

    For loop

    A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).
    This is less like the for keyword in other programming languages, and works more like an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming languages.
    With the for loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc.

    fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
    for x in fruits:
      print(x)

    The for loop does not require an indexing variable to set beforehand.
    To loop through a set of code a specified number of times, we can use the range() function.
    The range() function returns a sequence of numbers, starting from 0 by default, and increments by 1 (by default), and ends at a specified number.
    The range() function defaults to increment the sequence by 1, however it is possible to specify the increment value by adding a third parameter: range(2, 30, 3).
    The else keyword in a for loop specifies a block of code to be executed when the loop is finished.
    A nested loop is a loop inside a loop.
    The “inner loop” will be executed one time for each iteration of the “outer loop”:

    adj = ["red", "big", "tasty"]
    fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

    for x in adj:
      for y in fruits:
        print(x, y)

    for loops cannot be empty, but if you for some reason have a for loop with no content, put in the pass statement to avoid getting an error.

    for x in [0, 1, 2]:
      pass
    Function definition
    def function_name():
        return
    Function call
    function_name()

    We need not to specify the return type of the function.
    Functions by default return None
    We can return any datatype.

    The idea behind big O notation
    Big O notation is the language we use for talking about how long an
    algorithm takes to run. It’s how we compare the efficiency of
    different approaches to a problem.
    With big O notation we express the runtime in terms of
    how quickly it grows relative to the input, as the input gets arbitrarily large_.

    how quickly the runtime grows — 

    It’s hard to pin down the exact runtime of an algorithm.

    It depends on the speed of the processor,
    what else the computer is running, etc.

    So instead of talking about the runtime directly, we use big O notation to talk about how quickly the runtime grows.

    relative to the input — If we were measuring our runtime directly,

    we could express our speed in seconds. Since we’re measuring how quickly our runtime grows, we need to express our speed in terms of…something else. With Big O notation, we use the size of the input, which we call “n.” So we can say things like the runtime grows “on the order of the size of the input” () or “on the order of the square of the size of the input” ().

    as the input gets arbitrarily large — 

    Our algorithm may have steps that seem expensive when n is small but are eclipsed eventually by other steps as n gets huge. For big O analysis, we care most about the stuff that grows fastest as the input grows, because everything else is quickly eclipsed as n gets very large. (If you know what an asymptote is, you might see why “big O analysis” is sometimes called “asymptotic analysis.”)hy “big O analysis” is sometimes called
    "asymptotic analysis.")

    Data Structures Reference

    Array
    Stores things in order. Has quick lookups by index.






    Linked List



    Also stores things in order. Faster insertions and deletions than
    arrays, but slower lookups (you have to “walk down” the whole list).
    !
    Queue
    Like the line outside a busy restaurant. “First come, first served.”



    Stack






    Like a stack of dirty plates in the sink. The first one you take off the
    top is the last one you put down.
    Tree
    Good for storing hierarchies. Each node can have “child” nodes.


















    Binary Search Tree
    Everything in the left subtree is smaller than the current node,
    everything in the right subtree is larger. lookups, but only if the tree
    is balanced!



    Binary Search Tree
    Graph
    Good for storing networks, geography, social relationships, etc.









    Heap
    A binary tree where the smallest value is always at the top. Use it to implement a priority queue.
    ![A binary heap is a binary tree where the nodes are organized to so that the smallest value is always at the top.]
    Adjacency list
    A list where the index represents the node and the value at that index is a list of the node’s neighbors:
    graph = [ [1], [0, 2, 3], [1, 3], [1, 2], ]
    Since node 3 has edges to nodes 1 and 2, graph[3] has the adjacency list [1, 2].
    We could also use a dictionary where the keys represent the node and the values are the lists of neighbors.
    graph = { 0: [1], 1: [0, 2, 3], 2: [1, 3], 3: [1, 2], }
    This would be useful if the nodes were represented by strings, objects, or otherwise didn’t map cleanly to list indices.
    Adjacency matrix
    A matrix of 0s and 1s indicating whether node x connects to node y (0 means no, 1 means yes).
    graph = [ [0, 1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1], [0, 1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 1, 0], ]
    Since node 3 has edges to nodes 1 and 2, graph[3][1] and graph[3][2] have value 1.
    a = LinkedListNode(5) b = LinkedListNode(1) c = LinkedListNode(9) a.next = b b.next = c

    Arrays
    Ok, so we know how to store individual numbers. Let’s talk about storing several numbers.
    That’s right, things are starting to heat up.
    Suppose we wanted to keep a count of how many bottles of kombucha we drink every day.
    Let’s store each day’s kombucha count in an 8-bit, fixed-width, unsigned integer. That should be plenty — we’re not likely to get through more than 256 (2⁸) bottles in a single day, right?
    And let’s store the kombucha counts right next to each other in RAM, starting at memory address 0:



    Bam. That’s an array. RAM is basically an array already.
    Just like with RAM, the elements of an array are numbered. We call that number the index of the array element (plural: indices). In this example, each array element’s index is the same as its address in RAM.
    But that’s not usually true. Suppose another program like Spotify had already stored some information at memory address 2:
    We’d have to start our array below it, for example at memory address 3. So index 0 in our array would be at memory address 3, and index 1 would be at memory address 4, etc.:
    Suppose we wanted to get the kombucha count at index 4 in our array. How do we figure out what address in memory to go to? Simple math:
    Take the array’s starting address (3), add the index we’re looking for (4), and that’s the address of the item we’re looking for. 3 + 4 = 7. In general, for getting the nth item in our array:
    \text{address of nth item in array} = \text{address of array start} + n
    This works out nicely because the size of the addressed memory slots and the size of each kombucha count are both 1 byte. So a slot in our array corresponds to a slot in RAM.
    But that’s not always the case. In fact, it’s usually not the case. We usually use 64-bit integers.
    So how do we build an array of 64-bit (8 byte) integers on top of our 8-bit (1 byte) memory slots?
    We simply give each array index 8 address slots instead of 1:
    So we can still use simple math to grab the start of the nth item in our array — just gotta throw in some multiplication:
    \text{address of nth item in array} = \text{address of array start} + (n * \text{size of each item in bytes})
    Don’t worry — adding this multiplication doesn’t really slow us down. Remember: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of fixed-width integers takes time. So all the math we’re using here to get the address of the nth item in the array takes time.
    And remember how we said the memory controller has a direct connection to each slot in RAM? That means we can read the stuff at any given memory address in time.
    Together, this means looking up the contents of a given array index is time. This fast lookup capability is the most important property of arrays.
    But the formula we used to get the address of the nth item in our array only works if:

    Each item in the array is the same size (takes up the same

    number of bytes).

    The array is uninterrupted (contiguous) in memory. There can’t

    be any gaps in the array…like to “skip over” a memory slot Spotify was already using.
    These things make our formula for finding the nth item work because they make our array predictable. We can predict exactly where in memory the nth element of our array will be.
    But they also constrain what kinds of things we can put in an array. Every item has to be the same size. And if our array is going to store a lot of stuff, we’ll need a bunch of uninterrupted free space in RAM. Which gets hard when most of our RAM is already occupied by other programs (like Spotify).
    That’s the tradeoff. Arrays have fast lookups ( time), but each item in the array needs to be the same size, and you need a big block of uninterrupted free memory to store the array.

    ## Pointers
    Remember how we said every item in an array had to be the same size? Let’s dig into that a little more.
    Suppose we wanted to store a bunch of ideas for baby names. Because we’ve got some really cute ones.
    Each name is a string. Which is really an array. And now we want to store those arrays in an array. Whoa.
    Now, what if our baby names have different lengths? That’d violate our rule that all the items in an array need to be the same size!
    We could put our baby names in arbitrarily large arrays (say, 13 characters each), and just use a special character to mark the end of the string within each array…
    “Wigglesworth” is a cute baby name, right?
    But look at all that wasted space after “Bill”. And what if we wanted to store a string that was more than 13 characters? We’d be out of luck.
    There’s a better way. Instead of storing the strings right inside our array, let’s just put the strings wherever we can fit them in memory. Then we’ll have each element in our array hold the address in memory of its corresponding string. Each address is an integer, so really our outer array is just an array of integers. We can call each of these integers a pointer, since it points to another spot in memory.
    The pointers are marked with a * at the beginning.
    Pretty clever, right? This fixes both the disadvantages of arrays:

    The items don’t have to be the same length — each string can be as

    long or as short as we want.

    We don’t need enough uninterrupted free memory to store all our

    strings next to each other — we can place each of them separately, wherever there’s space in RAM.
    We fixed it! No more tradeoffs. Right?
    Nope. Now we have a new tradeoff:
    Remember how the memory controller sends the contents of nearby memory addresses to the processor with each read? And the processor caches them? So reading sequential addresses in RAM is faster because we can get most of those reads right from the cache?
    Our original array was very cache-friendly, because everything was sequential. So reading from the 0th index, then the 1st index, then the 2nd, etc. got an extra speedup from the processor cache.
    But the pointers in this array make it not cache-friendly, because the baby names are scattered randomly around RAM. So reading from the 0th index, then the 1st index, etc. doesn’t get that extra speedup from the cache.
    That’s the tradeoff. This pointer-based array requires less uninterrupted memory and can accommodate elements that aren’t all the same size, but it’s slower because it’s not cache-friendly.
    This slowdown isn’t reflected in the big O time cost. Lookups in this pointer-based array are still time.

    Linked lists
    Our word processor is definitely going to need fast appends — appending to the document is like the main thing you do with a word processor.
    Can we build a data structure that can store a string, has fast appends, and doesn’t require you to say how long the string will be ahead of time?
    Let’s focus first on not having to know the length of our string ahead of time. Remember how we used pointers to get around length issues with our array of baby names?
    What if we pushed that idea even further?
    What if each character in our string were a two-index array with:

    the character itself 2. a pointer to the next character

    We would call each of these two-item arrays a node and we’d call this series of nodes a linked list.
    Here’s how we’d actually implement it in memory:
    Notice how we’re free to store our nodes wherever we can find two open slots in memory. They don’t have to be next to each other. They don’t even have to be in order:
    “But that’s not cache-friendly, “ you may be thinking. Good point! We’ll get to that.
    The first node of a linked list is called the head, and the last node is usually called the tail.
    Confusingly, some people prefer to use “tail” to refer to everything after the head of a linked list. In an interview it’s fine to use either definition. Briefly say which definition you’re using, just to be clear.
    It’s important to have a pointer variable referencing the head of the list — otherwise we’d be unable to find our way back to the start of the list!
    We’ll also sometimes keep a pointer to the tail. That comes in handy when we want to add something new to the end of the linked list. In fact, let’s try that out:
    Suppose we had the string “LOG” stored in a linked list:
    Suppose we wanted to add an “S” to the end, to make it “LOGS”. How would we do that?
    Easy. We just put it in a new node:
    And tweak some pointers:
    ​1. Grab the last letter, which is “G”. Our tail pointer lets us do this in time.
    ​2. Point the last letter’s next to the letter we’re appending (“S”).
    ​3. Update the tail pointer to point to our new last letter, “S”.
    That’s time.
    Why is it time? Because the runtime doesn’t get bigger if the string gets bigger. No matter how many characters are in our string, we still just have to tweak a couple pointers for any append.
    Now, what if instead of a linked list, our string had been a dynamic array? We might not have any room at the end, forcing us to do one of those doubling operations to make space:
    So with a dynamic array, our append would have a worst-case time cost of .
    Linked lists have worst-case -time appends, which is better than the worst-case time of dynamic arrays.
    That worst-case part is important. The average case runtime for appends to linked lists and dynamic arrays is the same: .
    Now, what if we wanted to *pre*pend something to our string? Let’s say we wanted to put a “B” at the beginning.
    For our linked list, it’s just as easy as appending. Create the node:
    And tweak some pointers:

    Point “B”’s next to “L”. 2. Point the head to “B”.

    Bam. time again.
    But if our string were a dynamic array…
    And we wanted to add in that “B”:
    Eep. We have to make room for the “B”!
    We have to move each character one space down:
    Now we can drop the “B” in there:
    What’s our time cost here?
    It’s all in the step where we made room for the first letter. We had to move all n characters in our string. One at a time. That’s time.
    So linked lists have faster *pre*pends ( time) than dynamic arrays ( time).
    No “worst case” caveat this time — prepends for dynamic arrays are always time. And prepends for linked lists are always time.
    These quick appends and prepends for linked lists come from the fact that linked list nodes can go anywhere in memory. They don’t have to sit right next to each other the way items in an array do.
    So if linked lists are so great, why do we usually store strings in an array? Because arrays have -time lookups. And those constant-time lookups come from the fact that all the array elements are lined up next to each other in memory.
    Lookups with a linked list are more of a process, because we have no way of knowing where the ith node is in memory. So we have to walk through the linked list node by node, counting as we go, until we hit the ith item.
    def get_ith_item_in_linked_list(head, i): if i < 0: raise ValueError(“i can’t be negative: %d” % i) current_node = head current_position = 0 while current_node: if current_position == i: # Found it! return current_node # Move on to the next node current_node = current_node.next current_position += 1 raise ValueError(‘List has fewer than i + 1 (%d) nodes’ % (i + 1))
    That’s i + 1 steps down our linked list to get to the ith node (we made our function zero-based to match indices in arrays). So linked lists have -time lookups. Much slower than the -time lookups for arrays and dynamic arrays.
    Not only that — walking down a linked list is not cache-friendly. Because the next node could be anywhere in memory, we don’t get any benefit from the processor cache. This means lookups in a linked list are even slower.
    So the tradeoff with linked lists is they have faster prepends and faster appends than dynamic arrays, but they have slower lookups.

    ## Doubly Linked Lists
    In a basic linked list, each item stores a single pointer to the next element.
    In a doubly linked list, items have pointers to the next and the previous nodes.
    Doubly linked lists allow us to traverse our list backwards. In a singly linked list, if you just had a pointer to a node in the middle of a list, there would be no way to know what nodes came before it. Not a problem in a doubly linked list.
    Not cache-friendly
    Most computers have caching systems that make reading from sequential addresses in memory faster than reading from scattered addresses.
    Array items are always located right next to each other in computer memory, but linked list nodes can be scattered all over.
    So iterating through a linked list is usually quite a bit slower than iterating through the items in an array, even though they’re both theoretically time.

    ## Hash tables
    Quick lookups are often really important. For that reason, we tend to use arrays (-time lookups) much more often than linked lists (-time lookups).
    For example, suppose we wanted to count how many times each ASCII character appears in Romeo and Juliet. How would we store those counts?
    We can use arrays in a clever way here. Remember — characters are just numbers. In ASCII (a common character encoding) ‘A’ is 65, ‘B’ is 66, etc.
    So we can use the character(‘s number value) as the index in our array, and store the count for that character at that index in the array:
    With this array, we can look up (and edit) the count for any character in constant time. Because we can access any index in our array in constant time.
    Something interesting is happening here — this array isn’t just a list of values. This array is storing two things: characters and counts. The characters are implied by the indices.
    So we can think of an array as a table with two columns…except you don’t really get to pick the values in one column (the indices) — they’re always 0, 1, 2, 3, etc.
    But what if we wanted to put any value in that column and still get quick lookups?
    Suppose we wanted to count the number of times each word appears in Romeo and Juliet. Can we adapt our array?
    Translating a character into an array index was easy. But we’ll have to do something more clever to translate a word (a string) into an array index…
    Here’s one way we could do it:
    Grab the number value for each character and add those up.
    The result is 429. But what if we only have 30 slots in our array? We’ll use a common trick for forcing a number into a specific range: the modulus operator (%). Modding our sum by 30 ensures we get a whole number that’s less than 30 (and at least 0):
    429 \: \% \: 30 = 9
    Bam. That’ll get us from a word (or any string) to an array index.
    This data structure is called a hash table or hash map. In our hash table, the counts are the values and the words (“lies, “ etc.) are the keys (analogous to the indices in an array). The process we used to translate a key into an array index is called a hashing function.
    ![A blank array except for a 20, labeled as the value, stored at index

    To the left the array is the word “lies,” labeled as the key, with an

    arrow pointing to the right at diamond with a question mark in the middle, labeled as the hashing function. The diamond points to the 9th index of the array.](https://www.interviewcake.com/images/svgs/cs_for_hackers__hash_tables_lies_key_labeled.svg?bust=209)
    The hashing functions used in modern systems get pretty complicated — the one we used here is a simplified example.
    Note that our quick lookups are only in one direction — we can quickly get the value for a given key, but the only way to get the key for a given value is to walk through all the values and keys.
    Same thing with arrays — we can quickly look up the value at a given index, but the only way to figure out the index for a given value is to walk through the whole array.
    One problem — what if two keys hash to the same index in our array? Look at “lies” and “foes”:
    They both sum up to 429! So of course they’ll have the same answer when we mod by 30:
    429 \: \% \: 30 = 9
    So our hashing function gives us the same answer for “lies” and “foes.” This is called a hash collision. There are a few different strategies for dealing with them.
    Here’s a common one: instead of storing the actual values in our array, let’s have each array slot hold a pointer to a linked list holding the counts for all the words that hash to that index:
    One problem — how do we know which count is for “lies” and which is for “foes”? To fix this, we’ll store the word as well as the count in each linked list node:
    “But wait!” you may be thinking, “Now lookups in our hash table take time in the worst case, since we have to walk down a linked list.” That’s true! You could even say that in the worst case every key creates a hash collision, so our whole hash table degrades to a linked list.
    In industry though, we usually wave our hands and say collisions are rare enough that on average lookups in a hash table are time. And there are fancy algorithms that keep the number of collisions low and keep the lengths of our linked lists nice and short.
    But that’s sort of the tradeoff with hash tables. You get fast lookups by key…except some lookups could be slow. And of course, you only get those fast lookups in one direction — looking up the key for a given value still takes time
    Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Breadth-First Traversal
    Breadth-first search (BFS) is a method for exploring a tree or graph. In a BFS, you first explore all the nodes one step away, then all the nodes two steps away, etc.
    Breadth-first search is like throwing a stone in the center of a pond. The nodes you explore “ripple out” from the starting point.
    Here’s a how a BFS would traverse this tree, starting with the root:
    We’d visit all the immediate children (all the nodes that’re one step away from our starting node):
    Then we’d move on to all those nodes’ children (all the nodes that’re two steps away from our starting node):
    And so on:
    Until we reach the end.
    Breadth-first search is often compared with depth-first search.
    Advantages:

    A BFS will find the shortest path between the starting point and

    any other reachable node. A depth-first search will not necessarily find the shortest path.
    Disadvantages

    A BFS on a binary tree generally requires more memory than a DFS.

    Binary Search Tree
    A binary tree is a tree where <==(every node has two or fewer children)==>.
    The children are usually called left and right.
    class BinaryTreeNode(object):
    This lets us build a structure like this:
    That particular example is special because every level of the tree is completely full. There are no “gaps.” We call this kind of tree “perfect.”
    Binary trees have a few interesting properties when they’re perfect:
    Property 1: the number of total nodes on each “level” doubles as we move down the tree.
    Property 2: the number of nodes on the last level is equal to the sum of the number of nodes on all other levels (plus 1). In other words, about half of our nodes are on the last level.
    <==(*Let’s call the number of nodes n, *)==>
    <==(_and the height of the tree h. _)==>
    h can also be thought of as the “number of levels.”
    If we had h, how could we calculate n?
    Let’s just add up the number of nodes on each level!
    If we zero-index the levels, the number of nodes on the xth level is exactly 2^x.

    Level 0: 2⁰ nodes,
    2. Level 1: 2¹ nodes,
    3. Level 2: 2² nodes,
    4. Level 3: 2³ nodes,
    5. etc

    So our total number of nodes is:
    n = 2⁰ + 2¹ + 2² + 2³ + … + 2^{h-1}
    Why only up to 2^{h-1}?
    Notice that we started counting our levels at 0.

    So if we have h levels in total,
    the last level is actually the “h-1”-th level.
    That means the number of nodes on the last level is 2^{h-1}.

    But we can simplify.
    Property 2 tells us that the number of nodes on the last level is (1 more than) half of the total number of nodes,
    so we can just take the number of nodes on the last level, multiply it by 2, and subtract 1 to get the number of nodes overall.

    We know the number of nodes on the last level is 2^{h-1},


    So:



    n = 2^{h-1} * 2–1
    n = 2^{h-1} * 2¹ — 1
    n = 2^{h-1+1}- 1
    n = 2^{h} — 1
    So that’s how we can go from h to n. What about the other direction?
    We need to bring the h down from the exponent.
    That’s what logs are for!
    First, some quick review.
    <==(log_{10} (100) )==>
    simply means,
    “What power must you raise 10 to in order to get 100?”.
    Which is 2,
    because .
    <==(10² = 100 )==>
    Graph Data Structure: Directed, Acyclic, etc
    Graph =====
    Binary numbers
    Let’s put those bits to use. Let’s store some stuff. Starting with numbers.
    The number system we usually use (the one you probably learned in elementary school) is called base 10, because each digit has ten possible values (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 0).
    But computers don’t have digits with ten possible values. They have bits with two possible values. So they use base 2 numbers.
    Base 10 is also called decimal. Base 2 is also called binary.
    To understand binary, let’s take a closer look at how decimal numbers work. Take the number “101” in decimal:
    Notice we have two “1”s here, but they don’t mean the same thing. The leftmost “1” means 100, and the rightmost “1” means 1. That’s because the leftmost “1” is in the hundreds place, while the rightmost “1” is in the ones place. And the “0” between them is in the tens place.
    So this “101” in base 10 is telling us we have “1 hundred, 0 tens, and 1 one.”
    Notice how the places in base 10 (ones place, tens place, hundreds place, etc.) are sequential powers of 10:

    10⁰=1 * 10¹=10 * 10²=100 * 10³=1000 * etc.

    The places in binary (base 2) are sequential powers of 2:

    2⁰=1 * 2¹=2 * 2²=4 * 2³=8 * etc.

    So let’s take that same “101” but this time let’s read it as a binary number:
    Reading this from right to left: we have a 1 in the ones place, a 0 in the twos place, and a 1 in the fours place. So our total is 4 + 0 + 1 which is 5.

    Dillinger is a cloud-enabled, mobile-ready, offline-storage compatible, AngularJS-powered HTML5 Markdown editor.

    Type some Markdown on the left
    See HTML in the right




    Features

    Import a HTML file and watch it magically convert to Markdown
    Drag and drop images (requires your Dropbox account be linked)
    Import and save files from GitHub, Dropbox, Google Drive and One Drive
    Drag and drop markdown and HTML files into Dillinger
    Export documents as Markdown, HTML and PDF

    Markdown is a lightweight markup language based on the formatting conventions that people naturally use in email. As John Gruber writes on the Markdown site

    The overriding design goal for Markdown’s formatting syntax is to make it as readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions.

    This text you see here is actually written in Markdown! To get a feel for Markdown’s syntax, type some text into the left window and watch the results in the right.
    Dillinger was first designed and developed by @joemccann because he needed a decent Markdown editor. 2014, it got redesigned and coded by @mrtnbroder.
    Dillinger is a 100% open source project so fork the code and contribute!
    Follow Dillinger on Twitter at @dillingerapp.
    1.) Codepen:
    For quick prototyping and experimentation:
    FAQ:
    You write code in the editors, the results of that code are shown to you in the preview area. It’s simple, but powerful! Beginners and experts alike work best when they can see the results of what they are doing as they do it.
    How do you make a Pen?
    You must have an account and be logged in, then you head to the Pen Editor, and save it when you are ready.
    How do I save changes?
    After the first save, changes you make in the Pen Editor are automatically saved on a timer, but that is a Pen-level setting you can change if you wish.
    You can also fork a Pen to make another copy.
    How do I share a Pen?
    By default, Pens are public, meaning the Pen will have a URL you can share anywhere you like and anyone will be able to see it. You could share it to Twitter, Facebook, over email… anywhere you like.
    Just by virtue of saving a public Pen, you’re also making it public to the world of CodePen. Your followers will see it in their following page and it will be available in global search.
    Important Concept: You can make Pens private as well. A private Pen will not show up in global search (we’ll even try to hide it from search engines) and won’t be on your public profile or anywhere else. But you can still share a private Pen. If you give someone the URL, they’ll still be able to see it.

    2.) Free Code Camp:



    More than 40,000 people have gotten developer jobs after completing this — including at big companies like Google and Microsoft. If you are new to programming, we recommend you start at the beginning and earn these certifications in order. To earn each certification, build its 5 required projects and get all their tests to pass. You can add these certifications to your résumé or LinkedIn. But more important than the certifications is the practice you get along the way. If you feel overwhelmed, that is normal. Programming is hard. Practice is the key. Practice, practice, practice. And this curriculum will give you thousands of hours of hands-on programming practice.
    And if you want to learn more math and computer science theory, we also have thousands of hours of video courses on freeCodeCamp’s YouTube channel. If you want to get a developer job or freelance clients, programming skills will be just part of the puzzle. You also need to build your personal network and your reputation as a developer. You can do this on Twitter and GitHub, and also on the freeCodeCamp forum.

    4.) Pandoc:
    Pandoc dubs itself a “markup format” converter. It can take a document in one of the supported formats and convert only its markup to another format. Maintaining the look and feel of the document is not a priority.
    Plug-ins for custom formats can also be written in Lua, which has been used to create an exporting tool for the Journal Article Tag Suite, for example
    An included CiteProc option allows Pandoc to use bibliographic data from reference management software in any of four formats: BibTeX, BibLaTeX, CSL JSON or CSL YAML. The information is automatically transformed into a citation in various styles (such as APA, Chicago, or MLA) using an implementation of the Citation Style Language. This allows the program to serve as a simpler alternative to LaTeX for producing academic writing
    Supported file formats
    Pandoc’s most thoroughly supported file format is an extended version of Markdown but it can also read many other forms of:

    What is Colaboratory?
    Colaboratory, or “Colab” for short, is a product from Google Research. Colab allows anybody to write and execute arbitrary python code through the browser and is especially well suited to machine learning, data analysis, and education. More technically, Colab is a hosted Jupyter notebook service that requires no setup to use, while providing free access to computing resources including GPUs.
    Is it really free to use?
    Yes. Colab is free to use.
    Seems too good to be true. What are the limitations?
    Colab resources are not guaranteed and not unlimited, and the usage limits sometimes fluctuate. This is necessary for Colab to be able to provide resources for free. For more details, see Resource Limits
    Users who are interested in more reliable access to better resources may be interested in Colab Pro.
    What is the difference between Jupyter and Colab?
    Jupyter is the open-source project on which Colab is based. Colab allows you to use and share Jupyter notebooks with others without having to download, install, or run anything.

    9.) Stackbit:
    I am currently building myself a new blog site… I sometimes develop it locally in vscode… but there’s no doubt that it took something very similar to it’s present form in a GUI!
    https://bgoonz-blog.netlify.app/



    Stackbit takes all the tools you’d need for a site’s stack (theme, static site generator, CMS, and deployment) and quickly bundles them together for you. It offers options in each category, so you can mix and match the tools in your stack that best suit your needs.
    At this point, you may be thinking, Ok, but “fast” is a relative term in this space… how “fast” are we really talking here?
    Great question. Let me put it to you this way: you could literally throw a HotPocket in the microwave, go build an incredibly sleek JAMstack site, and you’d still be waiting for your food to be cool enough to eat.
    Site Preview
    The preview of your site in Stackbit is generated by the development server of your static-site-generator such as Gatsby or Jekyll. Because the preview is served by the SSG development server, any changes to site’s content and code are immediately reflected in the preview. To show you the preview Stackbit runs the development server of your SSG and routes the site pages to your browser.
    Running Preview
    Stackbit runs the following steps to show you the preview of your site:




    It clones your site’s repository
    It checks-out the preview branch
    It installs your site dependencies depending on your static site generator (e.g., npm install for Node based SSGs such as Gatsby and Next.js, and bundle install for Jekyll)
    It runs your static site generator’s development server (e.g.: gatsby develop for Gatsby, and bundle exec jekyll serve for Jekyll).
    It routes any page requests made from your browser to SSG’s development server and returns responses back to your browser, as if you are developing your site locally on your local machine.

    For example, suppose your site uses Gatsby. In that case, after cloning your repository, checking out the preview branch, and installing dependencies, Stackbit executes gatsby develop in its preview-server to start Gatsby’s development server and then routes page requests from your browser to that development server running internally on http://localhost.
    If your site uses Hugo, Stackbit executes hugo server and routes page requests to Hugo’s development server running internally on http://localhost.
    You can see the logs of how Stackbit pulls your repository, installs dependencies, and runs your SSG’s development server by clicking on the “Logs” button in the “Advanced Tools” bottom bar:



    Preview Updates
    Because the preview is served by the SSG development server, any changes to site’s content and code are immediately reflected in the preview.
    Your SSG’s development server should listen to content changes and respond to them by refreshing any opened browser sessions via live-reload or HMR. Most of the static-site-generators have these functionalities enabled by default, so you don’t have to do anything.
    Due to the nature of static site generators and how their development server work, any changes made to the code, or the content are immediately picked up by the SSG and reflected in the browser.
    Of course, in order for Stackbit to show you the preview of your site, your SSG’s development server must work without crashing.

    10.) File Locator Pro:
    FileLocator is a search utility for Windows
    First things first, Windows Search can’t find a thing. For anyone used to Mac OS X or Linux and having access to advanced search functionality on their computers, Windows Search (formerly Windows Desktop Search) is a huge disappointment.
    Just watch how quickly it finds files by name in a 20GB folder!



    FileLocator Lite is free for personal and commercial use, although commercial use requires a per-user registration after a month.
    The user interface and experience is as good as it gets in an advanced program aimed at experienced users. The Pro version adds more controllers, but they can all be safely ignored unless you need something specific. The main program window opens up with three main input fields: search by file name or file contents, and where to look for the file.
    The true power of FileLocator is that it can search inside any kind of file to find what you’re looking for. Other search programs will only go through files it assumes the user is looking for.
    However, you’ll need FileLocator if you’re looking for something inside an unusual document format, a string from a program, software source-code, your browser cache, or anything else really. Note that only the Pro version can search inside compressed archives like ZIP.
    In the search result section, you can not only see a list of files that match your search query; you can see the line number and line content where the match is made. This little feature alone takes FileLocator a few notches up and beyond their meager competition from the Windows search utility.

    What’s a distributed version control system?
    Git is an example of a distributed version control system (DVCS) commonly used for open source and commercial software development. DVCSs allow full access to every file, branch, and iteration of a project, and allows every user access to a full and self-contained history of all changes. Unlike once popular centralized version control systems, DVCSs like Git don’t need a constant connection to a central repository. Developers can work anywhere and collaborate asynchronously from any time zone.
    Without version control, team members are subject to redundant tasks, slower timelines, and multiple copies of a single project. To eliminate unnecessary work, Git and other VCSs give each contributor a unified and consistent view of a project, surfacing work that’s already in progress. Seeing a transparent history of changes, who made them, and how they contribute to the development of a project helps team members stay aligned while working independently.
    Why Git?
    According to the latest Stack Overflow developer survey, more than 70 percent of developers use Git, making it the most-used VCS in the world. Git is commonly used for both open source and commercial software development, with significant benefits for individuals, teams and businesses.

    Git lets developers see the entire timeline of their changes, decisions, and progression of any project in one place. From the moment they access the history of a project, the developer has all the context they need to understand it and start contributing.
    Developers work in every time zone. With a DVCS like Git, collaboration can happen any time while maintaining source code integrity. Using branches, developers can safely propose changes to production code.
    Businesses using Git can break down communication barriers between teams and keep them focused on doing their best work. Plus, Git makes it possible to align experts across a business to collaborate on major projects.

    What’s a repository?
    A repository, or Git project, encompasses the entire collection of files and folders associated with a project, along with each file’s revision history. The file history appears as snapshots in time called commits, and the commits exist as a linked-list relationship, and can be organized into multiple lines of development called branches. Because Git is a DVCS, repositories are self-contained units and anyone who owns a copy of the repository can access the entire codebase and its history. Using the command line or other ease-of-use interfaces, a git repository also allows for: interaction with the history, cloning, creating branches, committing, merging, comparing changes across versions of code, and more.
    Working in repositories keeps development projects organized and protected. Developers are encouraged to fix bugs, or create fresh features, without fear of derailing mainline development efforts. Git facilitates this through the use of topic branches: lightweight pointers to commits in history that can be easily created and deprecated when no longer needed.
    Git Flow
    Cloning a repo and changing the remote url
    (These steps are only for when you initially clone a project repo. Not when you clone your partners repo to collaborate together. To do that, you only have to complete step 1!)
    1. The first step is to clone the repo!

    Navigate to the repo you want to clone and hit the big green code button. Copy the link given.





    Navigate in your terminal to the directory where you want this repo to live. I’ve chosen downloads
    git clone HTTPS://LINKTOURL/THATYOUCOPIED




    2. Sweet, you have the cloned repo in your preferred directory. Now lets make your own repo. On github, create a new repository.

    Default settings are fine. Hit the big green button Create Repository







    3. Next,
    copy the .git link that is on the next page. Do not do any other steps on this page — That is for when you do not clone a repo.

    These are the commands GitHub provides when you create a new Repo:
    Quick setup — if you’ve done this kind of thing before
    Set up in Desktop
    or
    HTTPSSSH
    Get started by creating a new file or uploading an existing file. We recommend every repository include a README, LICENSE, and .gitignore.
    …or create a new repository on the command line
    echo "# the-meaning-of-life-is-42" >> README.md
    git init
    git add README.md
    git commit -m "first commit"
    git branch -M master
    git remote add origin https://github.com/bgoonz/the-meaning-of-life-is-42.git
    git push -u origin master
    …or push an existing repository from the command line
    git remote add origin https://github.com/bgoonz/the-meaning-of-life-is-42.git
    git branch -M master
    git push -u origin master
    …or import code from another repository
    You can initialize this repository with code from a Subversion, Mercurial, or TFS project.
    Import code
    4. Whenever you clone a repo:
    It already has a .git directory with certain configurations set up. To be able to push this repo to your newly created GitHub repo we have to change the remote origin.

    To do that, just run this command: (Make sure you are inside the repo you cloned)

    git remote set-url origin https://LINK/TO/YOUR/GIT/THAT/YOU/COPIED/FROM/PREVIOUS/STEP.git
    OR:



    5. You can now run git push and it will push to your newly created repo.
    Basic Git Work Flow.

    After making changes to a file and you are ready to commit / push to your repo you can run the following commands:
    git add . - stages modified files to be committed.
    git status - displays files that have been modified
    git commit -m 'A helpfully commit message' - commits the changes to your local repo. Get in the habit now of making helpful commit messages
    git push - pushes your local commits to your GitHub repo!
    To pull down changes that your partner pushed to the repo you simply have to run:
    git pull - this will fetch the most recent updates!

    Git basics
    Like many disciplines, learning Git is just a matter of learning a new language. You’ll cover a lot of new vocabulary in this lesson! Remember that the vocabulary you’ll learn will allow you to communicate clearly with other developers worldwide, so it’s important to understand the meaning of each term.
    It’s also important to note that Git is a complex and powerful tool. As such, its documentation and advanced examples may be tough to understand. As your knowledge grows, you may choose to dive deeper into Git. Today, you’ll focus on the commands you’ll use every day — possibly for the rest of your programming career! Get comfortable with these commands and resist the urge to copy/paste or create keyboard shortcuts as you’re getting started.
    A glance into GIT
    Before you look at any practical examples, let’s talk about how Git works behind the scenes.
    Here is your first new word in Git-speak: repository, often shortened to repo. A Git repo comprises all the source code for a particular project. In the “dark ages” example above, the repo is the first directory you created, where work is saved to, and which acts as the source for code shared to others. Without a repo, Git has nothing to act on.
    Git manages your project as a series of commits. A commit is a collection of changes grouped towards a shared purpose. By tracking these commits, you can see your project on a timeline instead of only as a finished project:



    Notice the notes and seemingly random numbers by each commit? These are referred to as commit messages and commit hashes, respectively. Git identifies your commits by their hash, a specially-generated series of letters and numbers. You add commit messages to convey meaning and to help humans track your commits, as those hashes aren’t very friendly to read!
    A Git hash is 40 characters long, but you only need the first few characters to identify which hash you’re referring to. By default, Git abbreviates hashes to 7 characters. You’ll follow this convention, too.
    Git provides a helpful way for us to “alias” a commit in plain English as well. These aliases are called refs, short for “references”. A special one that Git creates for all repositories is HEAD, which references the most recent commit. You’ll learn more about creating your own refs when you learn about “branching”.
    Git maintains three separate lists of changes: the working directory, the staging area, and the commit history. The working directory includes all of your in-progress changes, the staging area is reserved for changes you’re ready to commit, and the commit history is made up of changes you’ve already committed. You’ll look more at these three lists soon.
    Git only cares about changes that are “tracked”. To track a file, you must add it to the commit history. The working directory will always show the changes, even if they aren’t tracked. In the commit history, you’ll only have a history of files that have been formally tracked by your repository.
    Tracking changes in a repository
    Now, let’s get practical!
    You can create a repository with git init. Running this command will initialize a new Git repo in your current directory. It’s important to remember that you only want a repository for your project and not your whole hard drive, so always run this command inside a project folder and not your home folder or desktop. You can create a new repo in an empty folder or within a project directory you’ve already created.
    What good is an empty repo? Not much! To add content to your repository, use git add. You can pass this command a specific filename, a directory, a “wildcard” to select a series of similarly-named files, or a . to add every untracked file in the current directory:
    # This will add only my_app.js to the repo:
    > git add my_app.js
    This will add all the files within ./objects:
    > git add objects/
    This will add all the files in the current directory ending in .js:
    > git add *.js
    This will add everything in your current directory:
    > git add .
    Adding a file (or files) moves them from Git’s working directory to the staging area. You can see what’s been “staged” and what hasn’t by using git status:



    In this example, “Changes to be committed” is your staging area and “Changes not staged for commit” is your working directory. Notice that you also have “Untracked files”, Git’s way of reminding us that you may have forgotten to git add a file to your repo. Most Git commands will include a bit of help text in the output, so always read the messages carefully before moving forward. Thanks, Git!
    Once you’re happy with your files and have staged them, you’ll use git commit to push them into the commit history. It’s significantly more work to make changes after a commit, so be sure your files are staged and exactly as you’d like them before running this command. Your default text editor will pop up, and you’ll be asked to enter a commit message for this group of changes.
    Heads Up: You may find yourself in an unfamiliar place! The default text editor for MacOS (and many variants of Linux) is called Vim. Vim is a terminal-based text editor you’ll discuss in the near future. It’s visually bare and may just look like terminal text to you! If this happens, don’t worry — just type :q and press your “return” key to exit.
    You’ll want to ensure that future commit messages open in a more familiar editor. You can run the following commands in your terminal to ensure that Visual Studio Code is your git commit editor from now on:
    > git config --global core.editor "code --wait"
    > git config --global -e
    If you experience any issues, you may be missing Visual Studio Code’s command line tools. You can find more details and some troubleshooting tips on Microsoft’s official VS Code and macOS documentation.
    Once you close your editor, the commit will be added to your repository’s commit history. Use git log to see this history at any time. This command will show all the commits in your repository’s history, beginning with the most recent:



    Like many Git commands, git commit includes some helpful shorthand. If you need a rather short commit message, you can use the -m flag to include the message inline. Here’s an example:
    > git commit -m "Fix typo"
    This will commit your changes with the message “Fix typo” and avoid opening your default text editor. Remember the commit messages are how you make your project’s history friendly to humans, so don’t use the -m flag as an excuse to write lame commit messages! A commit message should always explain why changes were made in clear, concise language. It is also best practice to use imperative voice in commit messages (i.e. use “Fix typo” instead of “Fixing the typo” or “Typo was fixed”).
    Branches and workflow



    You’ve seen what a project looks like with a linear commit history, but that’s just scratching the surface of Git’s utility. Let’s explore a new realm with branches. A branch is a separate timeline in Git, reserved for its own changes. You’ll use branches to make your own changes independently of others. These branches can then be merged back into the main branch at a later time.
    Let’s consider a common scenario: a school project. It’s a lot of extra hassle to schedule time together and argue over exactly what should be done next! Instead, group members will often assign tasks amongst themselves, work independently on their tasks, and reunite to bring it all together as a final report. Git branches let us emulate this workflow for code: you can make a copy of what’s been done so far, complete a task on your new branch, and merge that branch back into the shared repository for others to use.
    By default, Git repos begin on the master branch. To create a new branch, use git branch <name-of-your-branch>. This will create a named reference to your current commit and let you add commits without affecting the master branch. Here’s what a branch looks like:



    Notice how your refs help to identify branches here: master stays to itself and can have changes added to it independently of your new branch (footer). HEAD, Git’s special ref, follows us around, so you know that in the above diagram you’re working on the footer branch.
    You can create a new branch or visit an existing branch in your repository. This is especially helpful for returning the master branch or for projects you’ve received from teammates. To open an existing branch, use git checkout <name-of-branch>.
    Bringing it back together
    Once you’re happy with the code in the branch you’ve been working on, you’ll likely want to integrate the code into the master branch. You can do this via git merge. Merging will bring the changes in from another branch and integrate them into yours. Here’s an example workflow:
    > git branch my-changes
    > git add new-file.js
    > git commit -m "Add new file"
    > git checkout master
    > git merge my-changes
    Following these steps will integrate the commit from my-changes over to master. Boom! Now you have your new-file.js on your default branch.
    As you can imagine, branching can get very complicated. Your repository’s history may look more like a shrub than a beautiful tree! You’ll discuss advanced merging and other options in an upcoming lesson.
    Connect-W-Github
    Git can act as a great history tool and source code backup for your local projects, but it can also help you work with a team! Git is classified as a “DVCS”, or “Distributed Version Control System”. This means it has built-in support for managing code both locally and from a distant source.
    You can refer to a repository source that’s not local as a remote. Your Git repository can have any number of remotes, but you’ll usually only have one. By default you’ll refer to the primary remote of a repo as the origin.
    You can add a remote to an existing repository on your computer, or you can retrieve a repository from a remote source. You can refer to this as cloning the repo. Once you have a repository with a remote, you can update your local code from the remote by pulling code down, and you can push up your own code so others have access to it.
    I ❤️ Open Source
    While a remote Git server can be run anywhere, there are a few places online that have become industry standards for hosting remote Git repositories. The best-known and most widely-used Git source is a website called GitHub. As the name suggests, GitHub is a global hub for Git repositories. It’s free to make a Github account, and you’ll find literally millions of public repositories you can browse.
    GitHub takes a lot of work out of managing remote Git repositories. Instead of having to manage your own server, GitHub provides managed hosting and even includes some helpful graphical tools for complicated tasks like deployment, branch merging, and code review.
    Let’s look at a typical workflow using Git and GitHub. Imagine it’s your first day on the job. How do you get access to your team’s codebase? By cloning the repository!
    > git clone https://github.com/your-team/your-codebase.git
    Using the git clone command will create a new folder in your current directory named after the repo you’re cloning (in this case, your-codebase). Inside that folder will be a git repository of your very own, containing the repo’s entire commit history.
    You’ll likely start on the master branch, but remember that this is the default branch and it’s unlikely you want to make changes to it. Since you’re working on a team now, it’s important to think of how your changes to the repository might affect others.
    The safest way to make changes is to create a new branch, make your changes there, and then push your branch up to the remote repository for review. You’ll use the git push command to do this. Let’s look at an example:
    > git branch add-my-new-file
    > git add my-new-file.js
    > git commit -m "Add new file"
    > git push -u origin add-my-new-file
    Notice how you used the -u flag with git push. This flag, shorthand for --set-upstream, lets Git know that you want your local branch to follow a remote branch. You’ve passed the same name in, so you’ll now have two branches in your local repository: add-my-new-file, which is where your changes live after being committed, and origin/add-my-new-file, which keeps up with your remote branch and updates it after you use git push.
    You only need to use the -u flag the first time you push each new branch - Git will know what to do with a simple git push from then on.
    You now know how to push your changes up, but what about getting the changes your teammates have made? For this, you’ll use git pull. Pulling from the remote repo will update all of your local branches with the code from each branch’s remote counterpart.
    Behind the scenes, Git is running two separate commands: git fetch and git merge.



    Fetching retrieves the repository code and updates any remote tracking branches in your local repo, and merge does just you’ve already explored: integrates changes into the local branches. Here’s a graphic to explain this a little better:



    It’s important to remember to use git pull often. A dynamic team may commit and push code many times during the day, and it’s easy to fall behind. The more often you pull, the more certain you can be that your own code is based on the “latest and greatest”.
    Merging your code on GitHub
    If you’re paying close attention, you may have noticed that there’s a missing step in your workflows so far: how do you get your code merged into your default branch? This is done by a process called a Pull Request.
    A pull request (or “PR”) is a feature specific to GitHub, not a feature of Git. It’s a safety net to prevent bugs, and it’s a critical part of the collaboration workflow. Here’s a high-level of overview of how it works:
    You push your code up to GitHub in its own branch.
    You open a pull request against a base branch.
    GitHub creates a comparison page just for your code, detailing the changes you’ve made.
    Other members of the team can review your code for errors.
    You make changes to your branch based on feedback and push the new commits up.
    The PR automatically updates with your changes.
    Once everyone is satisfied, a repo maintainer on GitHub can merge your branch.
    Huzzah! Your code is in the main branch and ready for everyone else to git pull.
    You’ll create and manage your pull requests via GitHub’s web portal, instead of the command line. You’ll walk through the process of creating, reviewing, and merging a pull request in an upcoming project.
    Browsing Your Git Repository
    Repositories can feel intimidating at first, but it won’t take you long to navigate code like you own the place — because you do! Let’s discuss a few tools native to Git that help us browse our changes over time.
    We’ll be covering:
    Comparing changes with git diff
    Browsing through our code “checkpoints” with git checkout
    Seeing changes in real time
    Git is all about change tracking, so it makes sense that it would include a utility for visualizing a set of changes. We refer to a list of differences between two files (or the same file over time) as a diff, and we can use git diff to visualize diffs in our repo!
    When run with no extra options, git diff will return any tracked changes in our working directory since the last commit. Tracked is a key word here; git diff won’t show us changes to files that haven’t been included in our repo via git add. This is helpful for seeing what you’ve changed before committing! Here’s an example of a small change:



    Let’s break down some of the new syntax in this output.
    The diff opens with some Git-specific data, including the branch/files we’re checking, and some unique hashes that Git uses to track each diff. You can skip past this to get to the important bits.
    --- & +++ let us know that there are both additions and subtractions in the file “App.js”. A diff doesn’t have a concept of inline changes - it treats a single change as removing something old and replacing it with something new.
    @@ lets us know that we’re starting a single “chunk” of the diff. A diff could have multiple chunks for a single file (for example: if you made changes far apart, like the header & footer). The numbers in between tell us how many lines we’re seeing and where they start. For example: @@ +1,3 -1,3 @@ means we’ll see three lines of significant content, including both addition & removal, beginning at line one.
    In the code itself, lines that were removed are prefixed with a - and lines that were added are prefixed with a +. Remember that you won’t see these on the same lines. Even if you only changed a few words, Git will still treat it like the whole line was replaced.
    Diff options
    Remember that, by default, git diff compares the current working directory to the last commit. You can compare the staging area instead of the working directory with git diff --staged. This is another great way to double-check your work before pushing up to a remote branch.
    You’re also not limited to your current branch — or even your current commit! You can pass a base & target branch to compare, and you can use some special characters to help you browse faster! Here are a few examples:
    # See differences between the 'feature'
    branch and the 'master' branch.
    > git diff master feature
    Compare two different commits
    > git diff 1fc345a 2e3dff
    Compare a specific file across separate commits
    > git diff 1fc345a 2e3dff my-file.js
    Time travel
    git diff gives us the opportunity to explore our code’s current state, but what if we wanted to see its state at a different point in time? We can use checkout! git checkout lets us take control of our HEAD to bounce around our timeline as we please.
    Remember that HEAD is a special Git reference that usually follows the latest commit on our current branch. We can use git checkout to point our HEAD reference at a different commit, letting us travel to any commit in our repository’s history. By reading the commit message and exploring the code at the time of the commit, we can see not only what changed but also why it changed! This can be great for debugging a problem or understanding how an app evolved.
    Let’s look at a diagram to understand what checkout does a little better:



    Notice that we haven’t lost any commits, commit messages, or code changes. Using git checkout is entirely non-destructive.
    To browse to a different commit, simply pass in a reference or hash for the commit you’d like to explore. git checkout also supports a few special characters & reserved references:
    # You can checkout a branch name.
    You'll be using this particular branch a lot!
    > git checkout master
    You can also use commit hashes directly
    > git checkout 7d3e2f1
    Using a hyphen instead of a hash will take
    you to the last branch you checked out
    > git checkout -
    You can use "HEAD~N" to move N commits prior
    to the current HEAD
    > git checkout HEAD~3
    Once you’re done browsing the repo’s history, you can use git checkout <your-branch-name> to move HEAD back to the front of the line (your most recent commit). For example, in our diagram above, we could use git checkout master to take our HEAD reference back to commit 42ffa1.
    Why checkout?
    Most of Git’s power comes from a simple ability: viewing commits in the past and understanding how they connect. This is why mastering the git checkout command is so important: it lets you think more like Git and gives you full freedom of navigation without risking damage to the repo’s contents.
    That said, you’ll likely use shortcuts like git checkout - far more often than specifically checking out commit hashes. Especially with the advent of user-friendly tools like GitHub, it’s much easier to visualize changes outside the command line. We’ll demonstrate browsing commit histories on GitHub in a future lesson.
    Git ‘Do-Overs’: Reset & Rebase



    Git is designed to protect you — not only from others, but also from yourself! Of course, there are times where you’d like to exercise your own judgement, even if it may not be the best thing to do. For this, Git provides some helpful tools to change commits and “time travel”.
    Before we talk about these, a warning: The commands in this lesson are destructive! If used improperly, you could lose work, damage a teammate’s branch, or even rewrite the history of your entire project. You should exercise caution when using these on production code, and don’t hesitate to ask for help if you’re unsure what a command might do.
    After this lesson, you should:
    Be able to roll back changes to particular commit.
    Have an understanding of how rebasing affects your commit history.
    Know when to rebase/reset and when not to.
    Resetting the past
    Remember how our commits form a timeline? We can see the state of our project at any point using git checkout. What if we want to travel back in time to a point before we caused a new bug or chose a terrible font? git reset is the answer!

    Resetting involves moving our HEAD ref back to a different commit.

    No matter how we reset, HEAD will move with us. Unlike git checkout, this will also destroy intermediate commits. We can use some additional flags to determine how our code changes are handled.
    Soft resets
    The least-dangerous reset of all is git reset --soft.
    A soft reset will move our HEAD ref to the commit we’ve specified, and will leave any intermediate changes in the staging area.
    This means you won’t lose any code, though you will lose commit messages.
    A practical example of when a soft reset would be handy is joining some small commits into a larger one. We’ll pretend we’ve been struggling with “their”, “there”, and “they’re” in our app. Here’s our commit history:Those commit messages aren’t great: they’re not very explanatory, and they don’t provide a lot of value in our commit history. We’ll fix them with a soft reset:
    git reset --soft 9c5e2fc
    This moves our HEAD ref back to our first commit. Looking at our commit log now, we might be worried we’ve lost our changes:



    Our changes are still present in the staging area, ready to be re-committed when we’re ready! We can use git commit to re-apply those changes to our commit history with a new, more helpful message instead:



    Notice that the new commit has a totally new hash. The old commit messages (and their associated hashes) have been lost, but our code changes are safe and sound!
    Risky Business: Mixed resets
    If soft resets are the safest form of git reset, mixed resets are the most average! This is exactly why they’re the default: running git reset without adding a flag is the same as running git reset --mixed.
    In a mixed reset, your changes are preserved, but they’re moved from the commit history directly to the working directory. This means you’ll have to use git add to choose everything you want in future commits.
    Mixed resets are a good option when you want to alter a change in a previous commit. Let’s use a mixed reset with our “their”, “there”, “they’re” example again.
    We’ll start with “they’re”:



    Notice again that you don’t lose your code with a mixed reset, but you do lose your commit messages & hashes. The difference between --soft and --mixed comes down to whether you’ll be keeping the code exactly the same before re-committing it or making changes.
    Hard resets
    Hard resets are the most dangerous type of reset in Git. Hard resets adjust your HEAD ref and totally destroy any interim code changes. Poof. Gone forever.
    There are very few good uses for a hard reset, but one is to get yourself out of a tight spot. Let’s say you’ve made a few changes to your repository but you now realize those changes were unnecessary. You’d like to move back in time so that your code looks exactly as it did before any changes were made. git reset --hard can take you there.
    It’s our last round with “their”, “there”, and “they’re”. We’ve tried it all three ways and decided we don’t need to use that word at all! Let’s walk through a hard reset to get rid of our changes.
    We’ll start in the same place we began for our soft reset:



    It turns out that we’ll be using a video on our homepage and don’t need text at all! Let’s step back in time:
    git reset --hard 9c5e2fc
    Our Git log output is much simpler now:



    It’s empty — no changes in your working directory and no changes in your staging area. This is major difference between a hard reset and a soft/mixed reset: you will lose all your changes back to the commit you’ve reset to.
    If your teammate came rushing in to tell you that the boss has changed their mind and wants that homepage text after all, you’re going to be re-doing all that work! Be very confident that the changes you’re losing are unimportant before embarking on a hard reset.
    Rebase: ‘Alt-time travel’



    Sometimes we want to change more than a few commits on a linear timeline. What if we want to move multiple commits across branches? git rebase is the tool for us!
    Rebasing involves changing your current branch’s base branch. We might do this if we accidentally started our branch from the wrong commit or if we’d like to incorporate changes from another branch into our own.

    Isn’t that the same as git merge?

    git merge?" In almost all cases, you’d be right. Rebasing is a dangerous process that effectively rewrites history.
    I see you too like to live life Dangerously… tell me about Rebase..
    Let’s look at a situation where we might be tempted to rebase. We’ve added a couple commits to a feature branch while other team members have been merging their code into the master branch. Once we’re ready to merge our own branch, we probably want to follow a tried-and-true procedure:
    > git pull origin master
    This will fetch our remote master branch and merge its changes into our own feature branch, so it’s safe to pull request or git push. However, every time we do that, a merge commit will be created! This can make a big mess of our Git commit history, especially if lots of people are making small changes.
    We can use git rebase to move our changes silently onto the latest version of master. Here’s what the git log history of our two example branches looks like:



    Notice that both branches start at 9c5e2fc. That’s our common ancestor commit, and is where git merge would start stitching these branches together! We’re going to avoid that entirely with a rebase. We’ll run this command while we have working-on-the-header checked out:
    git rebase master
    Here’s our new commit history:






    working-on-the-header
    See how we changed the color of our commits after the rebase? Take a close look at the commit history changes as well. Even though our commits have the same content, they have a new hash assigned, meaning they’re entirely new commits! This is what we mean by “rewriting history”: we’ve actually changed how Git refers to these changes now.
    “Golden Rule of Git”
    These tools can all feel pretty nifty, but be very wary of using them too much! While they can augment your Git skills from good to great, they can also have catastrophic side effects.
    There’s a “Golden Rule of Git” you should know that directly relates to both git reset and git rebase:
    Never change the history of a branch that’s shared with others.
    That’s it! It’s simple and to the point. If you’re resetting or rebasing your own code and you make a mistake, your worst case scenario is losing your own changes. However, if you start changing the history of code that others have contributed or are relying on, your accidental loss could affect many others!

    This command adds a remote repository to your local repository (just replace https://repo_here with your remote repo URL).
    git add remote https://repo_here
    How to see remote URLs in Git:
    You can see all remote repositories for your local repository with this command:
    git remote -v
    How to get more info about a remote repo in Git:
    Just replace origin with the name of the remote obtained by
    running the git remote -v command.

    How to check remote branches that Git is tracking:
    This command shows the name of all remote branches that Git is tracking for the current repository:
    git branch -r
    How to fetch remote repo changes in Git:
    This command will download the changes from a remote repo but will not perform a merge on your local branch (as git pull does that instead).
    git fetch
    How to check the current commits log of a remote repo in Git
    Commit after commit, Git builds up a log. You can find out the remote repository log by using this command:
    git log origin/main
    How to merge a remote repo with your local repo in Git:
    If the remote repository has changes you want to merge with your local, then this command will do that for you:
    git merge origin/main
    How to get the contents of remote branches in Git without automatically merging:
    This lets you update the remote without merging any content into the
    local branches. You can call git merge or git checkout to do the merge.
    git remote update
    How to push a new branch to a remote repo in Git:
    If you want to push a branch to a remote repository you can use the command below. Just remember to add -u to create the branch upstream:
    git push -u origin branch_name
    How to remove a remote branch in Git:
    If you no longer need a remote branch you can remove it using the command below:
    git push --delete origin branch_name_here
    How to use Git rebase:
    You can transfer completed work from one branch to another using git rebase.
    git rebase branch_name_here
    Git Rebase can get really messy if you don’t do it properly. Before using this command I suggest that you re-read the official documentation here
    How to run rebase interactively in Git:
    You can run git rebase interactively using the -i flag.
    It will open the editor and present a set of commands you can use.
    git rebase -i master
    # p, pick = use commit
    # r, reword = use commit, but edit the commit message
    # e, edit = use commit, but stop for amending

    How to force a push request in Git:
    This command will force a push request. This is usually fine for pull request branches because nobody else should have cloned them.
    But this isn’t something that you want to do with public repos.
    git push -f

    Git Alias Overview
    It is important to note that there is no direct git alias command. Aliases are created through the use of the git config command and the Git configuration files. As with other configuration values, aliases can be created in a local or global scope.
    To better understand Git aliases let us create some examples.
    $ git config --global alias.co checkout
    $ git config --global alias.br branch
    $ git config --global alias.ci commit
    $ git config --global alias.st status
    The previous code example creates globally stored shortcuts for common git commands. Creating the aliases will not modify the source commands. So git checkout will still be available even though we now have the git co alias. These aliases were created with the --global flag which means they will be stored in Git’s global operating system level configuration file. On linux systems, the global config file is located in the User home directory at /.gitconfig.
    [alias]
            co = checkout
                br = branch
                ci = commit
                st = status
    This demonstrates that the aliases are now equivalent to the source commands.
    Usage
    Git aliasing is enabled through the use of git config, For command-line option and usage examples please review the git configdocumentation.
    Examples
    Using aliases to create new Git commands
    A common Git pattern is to remove recently added files from the staging area. This is achieved by leveraging options to the git reset command. A new alias can be created to encapsulate this behavior and create a new alias-command-keyword which is easy to remember:
    git config --global alias.unstage 'reset HEAD --'
    The preceding code example creates a new alias unstage. This now enables the invocation of git unstage. git unstage which will perform a reset on the staging area. This makes the following two commands equivalent.
    git unstage fileA
    $ git reset HEAD -- fileA

    Troubleshooting Git



    Here are some tips on troubleshooting and resolving issues with Git.
    Broken pipe errors on git push
    ‘Broken pipe’ errors can occur when attempting to push to a remote repository. When pushing you usually see:
    Write failed: Broken pipe
    fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly
    To fix this issue, here are some possible solutions.
    Increase the POST buffer size in Git
    If you’re using Git over HTTP instead of SSH, you can try increasing the POST buffer size in Git’s configuration.
    Example of an error during a clone: fatal: pack has bad object at offset XXXXXXXXX: inflate returned -5
    Open a terminal and enter:
    git config http.postBuffer 52428800
    The value is specified in bytes, so in the above case the buffer size has been set to 50MB. The default is 1MB.
    Check your SSH configuration
    If pushing over SSH, first check your SSH configuration as ‘Broken pipe’ errors can sometimes be caused by underlying issues with SSH (such as authentication). Make sure that SSH is correctly configured by following the instructions in the SSH troubleshooting documentation.
    If you’re a GitLab administrator and have access to the server, you can also prevent session timeouts by configuring SSH keep alive either on the client or on the server.
    Configuring both the client and the server is unnecessary.
    To configure SSH on the client side:

    On UNIX, edit ~/.ssh/config (create the file if it doesn’t exist) and add or edit:
    Host your-gitlab-instance-url.com ServerAliveInterval 60 ServerAliveCountMax 5
    On Windows, if you are using PuTTY, go to your session properties, then navigate to “Connection” and under “Sending of null packets to keep session active”, set Seconds between keepalives (0 to turn off) to 60.

    To configure SSH on the server side, edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config and add:
    ClientAliveInterval 60
    ClientAliveCountMax 5
    Running a git repack
    If ‘pack-objects’ type errors are also being displayed, you can try to run a git repack before attempting to push to the remote repository again:
    git repack
    git push
    Upgrade your Git client
    In case you’re running an older version of Git (< 2.9), consider upgrading to >= 2.9 (see Broken pipe when pushing to Git repository).
    ssh_exchange_identification error
    Users may experience the following error when attempting to push or pull using Git over SSH:
    Please make sure you have the correct access rights
    and the repository exists.
    ...
    ssh_exchange_identification: read: Connection reset by peer
    fatal: Could not read from remote repository.
    or
    ssh_exchange_identification: Connection closed by remote host
    fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly
    This error usually indicates that SSH daemon’s MaxStartups value is throttling SSH connections. This setting specifies the maximum number of concurrent, unauthenticated connections to the SSH daemon. This affects users with proper authentication credentials (SSH keys) because every connection is ‘unauthenticated’ in the beginning. The default value is 10.
    Increase MaxStartups on the GitLab server by adding or modifying the value in /etc/ssh/sshd_config:
    MaxStartups 100:30:200
    100:30:200 means up to 100 SSH sessions are allowed without restriction, after which 30% of connections are dropped until reaching an absolute maximum of 200.
    Once configured, restart the SSH daemon for the change to take effect.
    # Debian/Ubuntu
    sudo systemctl restart ssh
    CentOS/RHEL
    sudo service sshd restart
    Timeout during git push / git pull
    If pulling/pushing from/to your repository ends up taking more than 50 seconds, a timeout is issued. It contains a log of the number of operations performed and their respective timings, like the example below:
    remote: Running checks for branch: master
    remote: Scanning for LFS objects... (153ms)
    remote: Calculating new repository size... (cancelled after 729ms)
    This could be used to further investigate what operation is performing poorly and provide GitLab with more information on how to improve the service.
    git clone over HTTP fails with transfer closed with outstanding read data remaining error
    If the buffer size is lower than what is allowed in the request, the action fails with an error similar to the one below:
    error: RPC failed; curl 18 transfer closed with outstanding read data remaining
    fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly
    fatal: early EOF
    fatal: index-pack failed
    This can be fixed by increasing the existing http.postBuffer value to one greater than the repository size. For example, if git clone fails when cloning a 500M repository, you should set http.postBuffer to 524288000. That setting ensures the request only starts buffering after the first 524288000 bytes.
    The default value of http.postBuffer, 1 MiB, is applied if the setting is not configured.
    git config http.postBuffer 524288000

    CDN



    Content Delivery Network
    This is typically a paid service you can use to get great performance for your app. Many CDNs act as caching proxies to your origin server; some require you to upload your assets to them. They give you a URL for each resource in your app. This URL will resolve differently for folks depending on where they’re browsing.
    Behind the scenes, the CDN will distribute your content geographically with the goal of end-users being able to fetch your content with the lowest latency possible. For example, if a user is in India, they’d likely get content served from India faster than from the United States.
    CoffeeScript, TypeScript
    These are both languages that compile to JavaScript. You’re able to write your code using the syntax they offer and when ready you compile your TypeScript or CoffeeScript into JavaScript.
    CoffeeScript vs TypeScript
    Evergreen browsers
    Browsers that update themselves (without user intervention).
    Evergreen Browsers
    ES3, ES5, ES5.1, ES6 (aka ES2015), etc
    ES stands for ECMAScript, which is the specification that JavaScript is based on. The number that follows is the version of the specification.
    Most browsers support at least ES5, and some even have ES6 (also known as ES2015) support. You can check each browser’s support (including yours) here:

    ES5 support
    ES6 support

    ECMAScript
    LESS, Sass



    Both LESS and Sass are types of CSS preprocessor markup intended to give you much more control over your CSS. During the build process, the LESS or Sass resources compile down to vanilla CSS (which can be executed in a browser).
    Sass/Less Comparison
    Linter, linting, jslint, jshint
    A validation tool which checks for common issues in your JavaScript. You’d usually use this in your build process to enforce quality in your codebase. A great example of something to check for: making sure you’ve always got your semicolons.
    An example of some of the options you can configure
    Polyfill
    This is a concept that typically means providing JavaScript which tests for features that are missing (prototypes not defined, etc) and “fills” them by providing an implementation.
    Promise
    Asynchronous calls typically return a promise (or deferred). This is an object which has a state: it can be given handlers for when it’s fulfilled or rejected.
    Ember makes use of these in places like the model hook for a route. Until the promise resolves, Ember is able to put the route into a “loading” state.

    SSR
    Server Side Rendering
    Inside FastBoot: The Road to Server-Side Rendering
    Transpile
    When related to JavaScript, this can be part of your build process which “transpiles” (converts) your ES6 syntax JavaScript to JavaScript that is supported by current browsers.
    Besides ES6, you’ll see a lot of content about compiling/transpiling CoffeeScript, a short-hand language which can “compile” to JavaScript.

    Ember CLI specifically uses Babel via the ember-cli-babel plugin.

    Shadow DOM
    Not to be confused with Virtual DOM. Shadow DOM is still a work in progress, but basically a proposed way to have an “isolated” DOM encapsulated within your app’s DOM.
    Creating a re-usable “widget” or control might be a good use-case for this. Browsers implement some of their controls using their own version of a shadow DOM.

    W3C Working Draft
    What the Heck is Shadow DOM?

    Virtual DOM
    Not to be confused with Shadow DOM. The concept of a virtual DOM means abstracting your code (or in our case, Ember) away from using the browser’s DOM in favor of a “virtual” DOM that can easily be accessed for read/writes or even serialized.

    Adaptive Web Design (AWD) — encourages the creation of several versions of a
    web page for a specified number of device dimensions. Which template to display
    is determined in the HTTP GET request which recognises the screen size of the
    device. Adaptive Web Design was introduced to deal with mobile browsing when
    most sites were optimised for desktop only. As devices now exist in many sizes
    and dimensions from different mobile brands through tablets to desktops,
    Responsive Web Design has become a popular and more flexible alternative.
    Authentication — the process of verifying that you are who you say you are
    E.g. when you login to your email you use a password to authenticate your
    identity. Other methods for authentication include using an ID card or
    fingerprint/biometric method.
    Authorization — check that you are authorised (have permission) to perform a
    certain action or to see a given page. E.g. admin users are authorised to create
    new users on the website.
    Declarations — in JavaScript declarations are var, const and let for
    the creation of variables, constants and lexically scoped variables.
    Closure — the scope where a variable can be accessed. A function used within another function can access the parent function’s variables since its scope extends to its parent.
    In this example, the variable color is accessible to the function displayColor().
    function color() {
        var color = 'red';
        function displayColor() {
            alert(color);
        }
        displayColor();
    }
    CSS Box Model — the concept that in HTML all elements are contained within
    rectangles or boxes. Each box consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the
    actual content.
    Customer relationship management (CRM) — a CRM system allows businesses to
    manage business relationships and the data and information associated with them.
    E.g. using CRM to track holiday bookings for a holiday bookings site. The CRM
    would have information on the customer and the trip they’re planning/ have
    booked and any staff members or actions that may need taking to progress or
    confirm their booking.
    Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) — CRUD refers to the 4 basic
    operations you can perform on data in a relational database application. Create
    a new data entry, read or retrieve existing data from the database, update the
    value of an existing piece of data or delete an existing piece of data.
    Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) — is a specification that allows
    specified resources on a web page to be requested from another domain outside
    the domain from which the first resource was served. E.g. uploading images using
    different domains using Amazon S3. For more about origin policies see
    ‘Same-origin Policy’.
    Destructuring Assignment -
    the ability to unpack and assign variables when there are multiple parameters.
    A way to simply assign the variables and then swap their values.
    let x, y;
    [x, y] = [5, 6];
    // x = 5, y = 6
    [y, x] = [x, y];
    // x = 6, y = 5
    To assign values from an object.
    let obj = { 'a': 1, 'b': {'b1': '1.1'}}
    let {a, b, b:{b1}} = obj
    // a = 1, b = {'b1': '1.1'}, b1 = 1.1
    There is an extensive list found here for more examples.
    Domain Name — the characters/words used to identify a website after http:// or
    www.. The domain name consists of two parts. Take this example:
    https://dwyl.com, dwyl makes up the second level domain (SLD) which is
    then followed by .com which what is known as the top level domain (TLD) or
    parent domain. Other examples of top level domains are: .org, .co.uk
    .io. Domain names are the more memorable and user-friendly representation of a
    website’s IP address. Domain names are registered under the Domain Name
    System (DNS).
    Domain Name System (DNS) — a distributed global directory of website domain
    names (and other internet resources). The directory stores already registered
    domain names along with their corresponding IP addresses.
    Hexadecimal — Uses 16 different symbols. “0”-”9" to represent the values 0 to 9 and “A”-”F” (“a”-”f” is acceptable too) to represent the values 10 to 15. It’s common to use
    hexadecimals when working in CSS to assign colors to your elements.
    The hexadecimal for dwyl’s logo color is #4bc0a9 (teal).
    To convert the hexadecimal into RGB values, do the following:
    R = 4b
    G = c0
    B = a9
    Convert the letters to their numerical value.
    b = 11
    c = 12
    a = 10
    Red: 4 * (16^1) + 11 * (16^0) = 75
    Green: 12 * (16^1) + 0 * (16^0) = 192
    Blue: 10 * (16^1) + 9 * (16^0) = 169
    Hex: #4bc0a9 is RGB: 75, 192, 169.
    Hoisting — Hoisting is JavaScript’s default behaviour of moving var
    declarations to the top of the current scope when your code is run. What
    this means is that whatever line your write a var declaration on e.g. var x;,
    when your code is run it will automatically be lifted and read as if it were
    written on the top lines of your current scope (to the top of the current
    script or the current function).
    This means that you can use var’s higher up in the code before the line you’ve
    declared them on. So this example:
    x = "hello";
    console.log(x)     // logs 'hello'
    var x;            //  declaring `x` which is hoisted as if it were written at the top on compilation
    Is read by the computer like this:
    var x;            //  declaring `x` which has been hoisted to the top line on compilation
    x = "hello";
    console.log(x)     // logs 'hello'
    Higher-order Function — Functions that take other functions as parameters and/or return a function. Some examples of these types of functions are the map and reduce method used for arrays. They both accept a function to use on the elements in the given array.
    // perform an action twice
    function twice (func, value) {
      return func(func(value));
    }
    // func can be any simple (preferably pure) function:
    function func (value) {
    return value + 3;
    }
    console.log(twice(func, 1)); // 7
    console.log(twice(func, 7)); // 13
    Not to be confused with pure functions, this comment explains the difference between the variations.
    Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) — the set of rules for transferring files
    (text, graphic images, sound, video, and other multimedia files) on the World
    Wide Web. When you enter http:// in your address bar in front of the domain, it
    tells the browser to connect over HTTP.
    Initialisation — defining a variable and providing it with an initial value:
    e.g. var x = 1;.
    Internet Protocol (IP) Address — a unique series of numbers or hexadecimal
    digits used to identify a website.
    Microservices — the practice of running multiple web/application servers
    simultaneously. It is a widely accepted/used application architecture used in
    most companies. Lambda Functions are an example of a micro Node.js Server.
    Polymorphism — the ability for an object to take on many forms or types e.g.
    when a parent class is used to refer to a child class object. Operator
    overloading is one form of polymorphism. It is not used in Javascript but is a
    feature of C++, Scala, Ruby, Haskell and Rust.
    Progressive Web App (PWA) — PWAs are traditional websites that are enhanced
    with modern web technologies, allowing them to provide a more app-like
    experience. They offer functionality such as being saved as a tile on your
    mobile home screen, working offline and push notifications. The “progressive”
    part means they’re “progressively enhanced” with newer features, which means
    they’ll also work in older browsers that don’t support the new features. Unlike
    native apps, they don’t have to be updated/listed in the app store although it
    is possible to list them in the app store when this is desired.
    Regression Testing -
    the re-running of existing tests to ensure that new changes/fixes have not
    broken any existing functionality. We should perform regression testing any time
    we modify an application, automated testing is a convenient way to achieve this.
    REPL (READ, EVAL, PRINT, LOOP) — a REPL is an interactive toplevel or
    language shell. A simple, interactive computer programming environment that
    takes single user inputs (i.e. single expressions), evaluates them, and returns
    the result to the user. They are a handy tool for experimenting with
    functionality outside of the context of a project.
    Responsive Web Design (RWD) — is designing one version of a web page which
    reorders and resizes content in response to the size of a browser at any given
    point, not just predetermined device sizes. This means the design of the site
    is optimised for all screen sizes. See Adaptive Design for another approach to
    designing.
    Same-origin Policy — Under this security policy implemented by web browsers,
    a document (i.e. like a web page) hosted on server A can only interact with
    other documents that are also on server A. In short, the same-origin policy
    enforces that documents that interact with each other have the same origin.
    Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) — is the process of improving the visibility
    of a website or web page in unpaid/organic search engine results. There are many
    aspects to SEO and search engines change how it’s calculated over time. It may
    include the use of key words on a page, how often you add/edit content on your
    site, to the way other sites link to you on the web.
    Semantic HTML — semantic HTML is the use of HTML elements that accurately
    describe what they contain/are being used for E.g. a <p> tag indicates that the
    text within it is a paragraph whereas a <nav> tag should contain navigation
    content and a <footer> should appear at the end of the page.
    Syntactic Sugar — syntactic sugar refers to syntax in a language that is
    designed to make things easier to read. The syntax makes the language “sweeter”
    to use as things can be expressed more clearly or concisely. Something can be
    considered “syntactic sugar” if it could be removed from the language without
    removing any functionality on what the language can do. For example ternary
    operators in Javascript: x ? a : b doesn’t require the ternary operator syntax
    it could also be expressed with an if/else statement:
    if(x)
     { a }
    else
     { b }
    Technical Debt — Technical
    debt is the time/cost of “re-working” a feature (or entire app) because corners
    were cut the first time it was built. Think of Technical Debt like a “loan shark”
    for your project, if you take “shortcuts” to implement a feature quickly (e.g:
    by skipping tests) you will pay for it later and usually with “interest”. For
    more detail see: https://github.com/dwyl/product-owner-guide#what-is-technical-debt
    Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) -
    TCP is a protocol which exists to enable the establishment of a connection and
    the exchange of streams of data (multiple
    data packets) between
    one or more computers. TCP guarantees the delivery of data and that packets will
    be delivered in the same order in which they were sent.
    Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) handshake -
    A TCP handshake or three-way handshake is the first part in a three part process
    for TCP data transfer between a local host/client and a server. The handshake is
    a three-step method that requires both the client and server to exchange SYN and
    ACK (acknowledgment) packets to establish a connection before actual data
    communication begins.

    Front End Interview Questions Part 2 These will focus more on vocabulary and concepts than the application driven approach in my last post!medium.com

    👋🏻 Behavioral & Cultural Interview Questions

    Software engineer interviewers ask behavioral/cultural questions to evaluate interviewee’s soft skills, and also to decide whether the candidate is a cultural fit. Make sure you’ve prepared great answers to these interview questions.


    ⚫Tell me about yourself


    ⚫====>“Tell me about yourself” is one of the most common and important interview questions. However, it can be daunting, as it’s one you need to get right. After all, not only is it your first impression on the interviewer, but you also need to be simultaneously professional and authentic when answering it.


    ⚫So how can you give a good answer without oversharing? To help you structure your answer, we’ll give you a rough guideline: start with a short introduction, talk about the present, recount the past, and mention your future goals.





    What are some side projects you’re currently working on?
    Current Experience

    ⚫Outline the role you’re currently in, your responsibilities, and your achievements (without reciting your resume)


    ⚫Highlight what you’re most passionate about (i.e. working with PMs to perfect product specs, discussing with colleagues about different tech stacks, helping others excel in their jobs and career)


    ⚫Recount one or two job-related projects and/or situations that map onto the job you’re applying to (i.e. collaborating with designers, working with legacy code, implementing best-practices, introducing new tech stacks, mentoring your colleagues)

    Past Experience

    Now it’s time to highlight your skills a little:


    ⚫Selectively highlight one high-impact (preferably quantifiable) project you were involved with for each job


    ⚫Highlight the hard and soft skills you learned from your past working experiences


    ⚫Emphasize the initiatives you took to improve the company’s work flow (i.e. propose new flow to streamline sprints) or your own skillsets (i.e. engaging in hackathon with colleagues or friends)

    Future Expectations

    ⚫Convey what you hope to achieve and learn from the new job


    ⚫Detail products, projects, features, or initiatives you can imagine yourself help kick off and lead in the company


    ⚫Tell me what a productive day at work looks like to you


    ⚫This question may not appear in every interview, but when they do, it’s important for you to highlight your organizational and prioritization skills. When hiring managers ask this question, they want to know:


    ⚫Whether you’re a proactive communicator and a good planner of your time

    How you strike a balance between multiple ongoing projects
    Describe one or two instances where you had several projects running simultaneously and how you managed to prioritize different tasks, make progress, meet milestones, and work on iterations based on feedback.

    ⚫How you deliver quality work with limited time


    ⚫When there’s limited time and multiple projects going on, you may not be able to give 100% to the projects at hand. Let the interviewers know:


    ⚫How you decide which tasks should be prioritized


    ⚫How you negotiate deadlines and milestones with stakeholders


    ⚫How you ensure all projects will be delivered with acceptable quality


    ⚫At what milestones you believe it’s ok to deliver something “less than perfect”


    ⚫How you decide when to go back and improve the “minimum viable projects” delivered earlier in the project’s timeline

    Professional Skills

    ⚫Will you excel in this job? Are you passionate about this job? It’s time to show how. For the first question, highlight some of your professional abilities:


    ⚫Industry experience


    ⚫Technical skills


    ⚫Soft skills


    ⚫Key accomplishments

    For the second question, showcase your excitement for the job. Hiring managers want to see your excitement for these reasons:

    ⚫1>Excitement will fuel your performance


    ⚫2>Passion will confirm that you’re interested in this job


    ⚫Eagerness will help you get through challenges at work


    ⚫Company culture and shared values


    ⚫Do you know the company’s culture and will you be a good fit? Here are some culture-related points you could cover in your answer:


    ⚫You’re attracted to the company’s general reputation


    ⚫You’re inspired by a specific leader in the company


    ⚫You’re passionate about the company’s products and services


    ⚫You’re onboard with the company’s initiatives (community engagement, public endorsements, etc.)


    ⚫You admire the company’s culture. Here are some specific examples:


    Commitment to the company

    ⚫Are you passionate about the company and will you stay committed to this company? If the interviewer already asked you “Where do you see yourself in 5 years?” then you don’t have to stress too much about showing your long-term commitment when answering this question. However, if you haven’t had the opportunity to show your commitment to the company, the most organic way to show your commitment is to talk about your long term plans in the company. Here are some things you can talk about:


    ⚫Projects you want to start


    ⚫Potential directions you think the company can go in


    ⚫The different products/teams you want to contribute to


    ⚫Processes you’d like to participate in improving

    Why should we hire you?

    ⚫Ultimately, every single question interviewers ask you is related to this overarching question: “Why should we hire you?” Interviewers want to know, as confidently as possible, that you will be a good hire. Therefore, your answer should confirm that you’ll be a good hire.


    ⚫Unlike the more specific questions we’ve outlined above, this question is a generic question that requires a concise but powerful answer. Think about this as your elevator pitch — you should be able to sell yourself to the interview within a matter of minutes.


    ⚫To come up with your elevator pitch, you’ll need to do some planning and consolidation.


    ⚫Here are some guiding questions for you to kickoff your brainstorming sessions:


    ⚫What are the most important qualifications for this position from the company’s perspective?


    ⚫What are my strong suits and how do they set me apart from others?


    ⚫What are my most monumental accomplishments?


    ⚫Why are you the best person for this job?


    ⚫Consolidate and practice your pitch


    ⚫Combine your answers in prose form to make sure each point flows to the next smoothly


    ⚫Check to make sure your answer sets you apart from other candidates


    ⚫!!!!!!!Practice, practice, and practice, but DO NOT TRY TO MEMORIZE YOUR PITCH!!!!!!!!!

    📝 Interview Etiquette & Other Tips
    Nailing an interview takes more than just knowing how to answer common interview questions. You’ll also need to prepare questions of your own, think about salary, and get your communications right. Here’s how.
    Questions to ask in an interview
    ⮕As the job seeker, it’s normal to feel like you’re being interrogated during interviews. However, at its core, an interview is a conversation, and should be a two-way interaction. As the interviewee, you need to stay engaged and ask thoughtful questions.
    ⮕By asking questions, you’re expressing your genuine curiosity towards the company. This helps companies know that you’re serious about them. Additionally, it also helps you evaluate whether the job and/or the company is really what you’re looking for.
    ⮕There are fantastic resources out there with more than a dozen questions you can ask interviewers. Here, we’ll provide a few that we think are essential to help you gain deeper understandings about the role, company, and your future within the company:
    ⮕The job and cross-team communication
    ⮕The company’s values and working culture
    ⮕What are some shared qualities and characteristics among your employees?
    ⮕What’s your favorite part about working at the company?
    ⮕What’s your least favorite part about working at the company?
    Professional growth opportunities
    ⮕Are there multiple product/service teams in the company? Can engineers apply to join a different team? What does the process look like?
    ⮕Are there professional development courses and training available?
    ⮕Do senior engineers and engineering leads usually get promoted from within the company?
    Closing questions and next steps

    ⚫Is there anything unclear or concerning about my background that I can help clarify?


    ⚫What are the next steps in the interview process?


    ⚫Is there anything else I can provide you with that would be helpful?


    ⚫How to answer salary expectations?


    ⚫“What are you salary expectations?” can be a daunting question. If talking about money wasn’t uncomfortable enough already, most job seekers worry that proposing the “wrong number” would cost them the job — or land them a job offer with a disappointing salary. Not great.


    Follow up ?????

    ⚫Depending on how many rounds of interviews you’ve gone through, you may feel differently about how close you are to getting the job. The closer you get to the end of the hiring process, the more likely it is for you to start feeling anxious due to higher expectations. As a result, you may be eager to follow up with the hiring manager regarding your interview results. With that said, there’s a fine line between showing your eager attitude and coming off as desperate.


    ⚫Before we get to the types of follow up emails you should send out, make sure to ask the hiring manager about when you can expect to hear back from them about next steps. This information will help you decide when it’s appropriate to follow up down the line.


    ⚫There are four types of follow up emails you should send at different times after the interview: Thank you email, checking-in email, second follow up email, final follow up email.

    Thank you email
    A thank you email should be sent out on the same day of the interview or one day after your interview. The main purpose of this email is to show your excitement and appreciation. This email should be short and sweet and should include:
    A thank you note for their time
    ⮕A brief mention of the specific job you interviewed for
    ⮕A brief note of what you found most impressive about the company
    ⮕One or two things you learned about the organization
    ⮕One sentence about how you’re excited you are to contribute in a specific way




    Technical interview :
    ⮕questions examine a candidate’s thought processes and assess what approaches they adopt to solve problems. The most common end-to-end software development questions are listed below.
    Here’s the repo that I use to practice my technical chops for interviews:
    bgoonz/INTERVIEW-PREP-COMPLETE Tech Interview Asymptotic Notation Data Structures Algorithms Algorithm Basics Search Algorithms Sorting Algorithms…github.com
    1. Development

    ⚫Describe the process you used for a recent project, from requirements to delivery. Does your team prefer using Agile or Waterfall? Any pros and cons?


    ⚫ In answering this question, you need to show your planning, process, and communication/collaboration skills. Think in advance about a suitable project where your contributions cover all these bases.


    ⚫If you can, it’s best to choose to describe an Agile project you worked on, as organizations whether they use a Waterfall or Agile methodology, are keen to work with developers experienced in Agile.


    ⚫ Ideally, share a project in which you worked with a bigger team.


    ⚫ Outline the components of the project and what role you played.


    ⚫ Highlight any interactions with other teams and the process for handover and collaboration.


    ⚫Highlight any interactions with other teams and the process for handover and collaboration.

    2. Based on your experience in this project, specify your favorite and least favorite part of this type of collaboration.
    Remember to keep positive because the interviewers are always looking for constructive answers.

    ⚫You can specify cutting edge collaboration tools and techniques and/or methodologies that you already know the company employs in their own workflows.


    ⚫For the least favorite parts, don’t just list the downsides and failures, but also mention what you’ve learned from it and how you would improve.


    ⚫ Ensure that you come across humbled from the failures, not exasperated and that you know better than everyone else — even if you truly feel this way! Explain how you tried to positively encourage your team to correct the course rather than staying silent and going with a consensus majority.

    3. Based on the project, what programming languages / tools / services did you use? And why did you choose them?

    ⚫ Questions like this are designed to allow you to showcase your way of thinking. The interviewer is looking to hear your ability to make choices based on rational decisions — so make sure that you show that you can do this!


    To begin with, give an example of a project in which you had the most ownership or you had the greatest sense of achievement/efficiency/effectiveness from the toolchain used.


    ⚫ Next, describe the goal of the project, and briefly go through your responsibilities when it came to the toolchain decision-making process. Within Agile work practices, it’s usually a team effort to decide the best programming languages/tools/services are the best fit for the project, within customer requirements. Outline the consultation process you went through with both the customer and your team to arrive at the best solutions.

    4. Describe the biggest toolchain-related challenge you encountered in the project:

    ⚫Outline the situation, the goal you expected, and the reason why there was a challenge.


    ⚫Share the toolchain you used when you encountered the problem, then other technologies and tools you applied to help solve it, if applicable. Ensure to note whether there was a full tool pivot or you managed to build onto an existing library (or something similar) to achieve the end goal.


    ⚫Remember: the most important thing is not what you ultimately used, but how many options you referred to during the process, and which metrics you adopted to decide which tech to go for. Remember to share the pros and cons of your decision, and if, looking back now, whether you would do it differently.

    5. How would you design this system for scale?

    ⚫First of all, the interviewer would like to know the traffic level we’re expecting: 1,000, 100,000, or 10 million users per second? Think about the data expectations for each system user, database connections (blocking/nonblocking actions), downtime specifics, and cloud considerations (if any).


    ⚫List the potential problems that might occur when trying to scale. Different traffic levels may have different problems, so make sure you think this through, and decide the priorities of the problems that you should solve. Many codebases are not built for scale, so note code changes that might need to occur, rather than just infrastructure expectations.


    ⚫Different traffic levels may have different system architectures. List the options you think best fit your scenario and explain why you choose them. Many apps utilize a stripped-back product (which can be achieved through system architecture) when high traffic levels affect systems, rather than crashing the product completely or users experiencing unacceptable wait times.

    6. Testing: What is your process to test a code when developing a software or application? How do you decide the scope of your test case?

    ⚫First, do your groundwork to ensure that you thoroughly understand the different testing types. Do you know your unit testing from your regression testing from your user acceptance testing? If you need to brush up, check out this great resource.


    ⚫Once you’ve got that on lock, it’s time to share a project that you’ve tested thoroughly before.


    ⚫Remember to separate the project into different sections. Each section should apply the testing type that fits its characteristics. Describe the goals of different testing types, and also introduce the library/service you used for the test. (For bonus points: explain the pros and cons of the library/service and whether it was your decision to choose that particular suite.)


    ⚫It makes sense at this point to include documentation (and particularly inline documentation) you use that helps clarify functions/issues so that testing goes smoothly.


    ⚫You may also mention a project you were involved in where testing was not well conducted and how you would — or did — go about fixing the issues.

    Monitoring
    7. What kind of tools / services do you use for logging? What kind of data will you log? And what’s the next step when you get the log?

    ⚫Time for some details! When answering this question, give an example of a project that you’ve monitored before.


    ⚫Explain what information you logged and what questions it answered.


    ⚫Please do not just describe the data format but also give the reason why you decided to extract this data.


    ⚫Describe the reporting process and any associated tools used.


    ⚫Some questions to think about to help you structure your answer, and nail your response:


    What to avoid

    ⚫Complaining about having to handle the problem


    ⚫Showing how annoyed you were at the problem


    ⚫Pointing fingers at others for the problem


    ⚫Talking ill of your bosses or coworkers


    ⚫Keep in mind that your interviewer is not only trying to get a glimpse of your past, but to gain an understanding of how you might react to challenges should they hire you. Therefore, when you’re choosing your scenario, try to pick one that may be applicable in your new work setting as well.


    NOW; Here’s some for you guys to answer in the comments!
    8. Which logging services have you researched and used before?
    9. Why did you choose or look into each particular logging service?
    10. Was your decision because of the scale, the features, or the size of the community?
    11. In what scenarios did you check these logs? Was it scheduled daily/weekly/monthly or as an on-demand activity?
    12. What information would the data be transformed into? Was it for development, business, or customer decision-making?
    13. What information would the data be transformed into? Was it for development, business, or customer decision-making?

    Success Stories
    18 months ago I didn’t know how to code, I’m now a self-taught programmer who’s made apps for the NBA, NHL, and schools like Purdue, Notre Dame, Alabama and Clemson. I’m now releasing my software under the MIT license for anyone’s use — AMA!
    Last year I was unemployed and miserable. Using this sub and resources, I’ve been full time employed for a year. I did it with all free resources. I wanna share with you how I did it. (IOS)
    I began teaching myself to code a year ago. I got hired at my first job 4 months ago. Here is a breakdown of somethings I was not ready for (FYI job is remote ruby/rails dev)
    I’m 32 years old, and just started my first full-time job as a developer. One year ago my programming knowledge was basically nil. Everything I learned, I found via /r/learnprogramming, so just wanted to share my experience.
    From zero to software developer — Not really a success story, but a lot of redditors share how they learned. Great for beginners with no path

    What Are Bash Aliases And Why Should You Be Using Them!
    A Bash alias is a method of supplementing or overriding Bash commands with new ones. Bash aliases make it easy for users to customize their experience in a POSIX terminal. They are often defined in HOME/.bashrc *  * or * *HOME/bash_aliases (which must be loaded by $HOME/.bashrc).
    Most distributions add at least some popular aliases in the default .bashrc file of any new user account. These are simple ones to demonstrate the syntax of a Bash alias:
    alias ls='ls -F'
    alias ll='ls -lh'
    Not all distributions ship with pre-populated aliases, though. If you add aliases manually, then you must load them into your current Bash session:
    $ source ~/.bashrc
    Otherwise, you can close your terminal and re-open it so that it reloads its configuration file.
    With those aliases defined in your Bash initialization script, you can then type ll and get the results of ls -l, and when you type ls you get, instead of the output of plain old ls.
    Those aliases are great to have, but they just scratch the surface of what’s possible. Here are the top 10 Bash aliases that, once you try them, you won’t be able to live without.
    Set up first
    Before beginning, create a file called ~/.bash_aliases:
    $ touch ~/.bash_aliases
    Then, make sure that this code appears in your ~/.bashrc file:
    if [ -e $HOME/.bash_aliases ]; then
        source $HOME/.bash_aliases
    fi
    If you want to try any of the aliases in this article for yourself, enter them into your .bash_aliases file, and then load them into your Bash session with the source ~/.bashrc command.

    What Is An Iterator In JavaScript?
    In JavaScript an iterator is an object which defines a sequence and potentially a return value upon its termination.

    What Is An Iterator In JavaScript?
    In JavaScript an iterator is an object which defines a sequence and potentially a return value upon its termination.



    Specifically, an iterator is any object which implements the Iterator protocol by having a next() method that returns an object with two properties:
    valueThe next value in the iteration sequence.doneThis is true if the last value in the sequence has already been consumed. If value is present alongside done, it is the iterator’s return value.
    Once created, an iterator object can be iterated explicitly by repeatedly calling next(). Iterating over an iterator is said to consume the iterator, because it is generally only possible to do once. After a terminating value has been yielded additional calls to next() should continue to return {done: true}.



    But then what’s the value of the [Symbol.iterator] on the values that aren’t iterable?





    [Symbol.iterator] has to return an iterator, containing a next method which returns an object just like we saw before: { value: ‘…’, done: false/true }.





    Generator functions
    While custom iterators are a useful tool, their creation requires careful programming due to the need to explicitly maintain their internal state. Generator functions provide a powerful alternative: they allow you to define an iterative algorithm by writing a single function whose execution is not continuous. Generator functions are written using the function* syntax.
    When called, generator functions do not initially execute their code. Instead, they return a special type of iterator, called a Generator. When a value is consumed by calling the generator’s next method, the Generator function executes until it encounters the yield keyword.
    The function can be called as many times as desired, and returns a new Generator each time. Each Generator may only be iterated once.

    What is Memoization?

    And why this programming paradigm shouldn’t make you cringe.

    Dead Code Rising The last couple of weeks I’ve been using a lot of hours playing around with GatsbyJS, and it’s been a blast! Gatsby is…www.deadcoderising.com






    Memoization is a design paradigm used to reduce the overall number of
    calculations that can occur in algorithms that use recursive algorithms.
    Recall that recursion solves a large problem by dividing it into smaller
    sub-problems that are more manageable.
    Memoization will store the results of the sub-problems in some other data structure, meaning that you avoid duplicate calculations and only “solve” each subproblem once.
    This approach is near synonymous with another computer science term you may have heard before — caching. However, caching as a practice is not achieved exclusively by memoizing. Think of a cache as a little bucket where we will keep important information we don’t want to forget in the near future but that isn’t vitally important or part of the long-term makeup of our application. It’s less important than the things we need to store in memory but more important than a variable we can discard as soon as we use it once.
    There are two features that comprise memoization:

    The function is recursive.
    The additional data structure used is typically an object (we refer to this as
    the memo).

    This is a trade-off between the time it takes to run an algorithm (without
    memoization) and the memory used to run the algorithm (with memoization).
    Usually, memoization is a good trade-off when dealing with large data or
    calculations.
    You cannot always apply this technique to recursive problems. The problem must have an “overlapping subproblem structure” for memoization to be effective.
    Generally speaking, computer memory is cheap and human time is incalculably valuable so we may opt for this approach even when the largest gains on paper can be made from converting RAM at the expense of execution speed.
    Here’s an example of a problem that has such a structure:

    Using pennies, nickels, dimes, and quarters, how many combinations
    of coins are there that total 27 cents?

    Along the way to calculating the possible coin combination of 27
    cents, you should also calculate the smallest coin combination of 25 cents as well as 21 cents and any smaller total that comprises a fraction of the total combination of 27 (so long as there is a one-cent piece; if there are only nickels and up, the problem deviates from this approach on a technicality but in essence, it is still calculated in the same manner, that is to say as a component of that bigger problem).
    Remember, a computer is stupid and must check every possibility exhaustively to ensure that no possible combination is missed (in reality, I may be oversimplifying the truth of the matter but for now, please bear with me).
    This is the essence of a redundant subcomponent of the overall problem.
    Memoizing factorial
    From this plain factorial above, it is clear that every time you call
    factorial(6) you should get the same result of 720 each time. The code is
    somewhat inefficient because you must go down the full recursive stack for each top-level call to factorial(6).
    If we can store the result of factorial(6) the first time you calculate it, then on subsequent calls to factorial(6) you simply fetch the stored result in constant time.
    The memo object above will map an argument of factorial to its return
    value. That is, the keys will be arguments and their values will be the
    corresponding results returned. By using the memo, you are able to avoid
    duplicate recursive calls!
    By the time your first call to factorial(6)returns, you will not have just the argument 6 stored in the memo. Rather, you will have all arguments 2 to 6 stored in the memo.
    Perhaps you’re not convinced because:

    You didn’t improve the speed of the algorithm by an order of Big-O (it is
    still O(n)).
    The code uses some global variable, so it’s kind of ugly.

    Memoizing the Fibonacci generator
    Here’s a naive implementation of a function that calculates the Fibonacci
    number for a given input.
    function fib(n) {
      if (n === 1 || n === 2) return 1;
      return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);
    }
    fib(6);     // => 8
    The time complexity of this function is not super intuitive to describe because
    the code branches twice recursively. Fret not! You’ll find it useful to
    visualize the calls needed to do this with a tree. When reasoning about the time complexity for recursive functions, draw a tree that helps you see the calls. Every node of the tree represents a call of the recursion:




    n , the height of this tree will be n. You derive this by following
    the path going straight down the left side of the tree.
    each internal node leads to two more nodes. Overall, this means that the tree will have roughly 2n nodes.
    which is the same as saying that the fibfunction has an exponential time complexity of 2n.
    That is very slow!

    See for yourself, try running fib(50) - you’ll be waiting for quite a lot longer than you’ve gotten used to waiting for a program to run in the last decade.
    The green regions highlighted above are repetitive.
    As the n grows bigger, the number of duplicate sub-trees grows exponentially.
    Luckily you can fix this using memoization by using a similar object strategy.
    You can use some JavaScript default arguments `memo={}`to clean things up:
    You can see the marked nodes (function calls) that access the memo in green.
    It’s easy to see that this version of the Fibonacci generator will do far fewer
    computations as n grows larger! In fact, this memoization has brought the time complexity down to linear O(n) time because the tree only branches on the left side. This is an enormous gain if you recall the complexity of class hierarchy.
    The memoization formula
    Now that you understand memoization, when should you apply it? Memoization is useful when attacking recursive problems that have many overlapping sub-problems.
    You’ll find it most useful to draw out the visual tree first. If you notice duplicate sub-trees, time to memoize. Here are the hard and fast
    rules you can use to memoize a slow algorithm:

    Write the unoptimized, brute force recursion and make sure it works.
    Add the memo object as an additional argument to the function. The keys will
    represent unique arguments to the function, and their values will represent the results for those arguments.
    Add a base case condition to the function that returns the stored value if
    the function’s argument is in the memo.
    Before you return the result of the recursive case, store it in the memo as a
    value and make the function’s argument its key.

    Here’s the solution to the aforementioned coin problem:

    Why Jamstack Rocks🤘😎🤙
    JAMstack websites don’t use the microservices architecture, but they go for the micro frontends architecture. Each static page with HTML and JavaScript is a micro frontend. And they can use any REST API, including the one built on the microservices architecture.
    ALLOFMYOTHERARTICLES bryanguner.medium.com






    JAM stands for JavaScript, API & Markup.

    “A modern web development architecture based on client-side JavaScript, reusable APIs, and prebuilt Markup”


    — Mathias Biilmann (CEO & Co-founder of Netlify).

    JavaScript
    Dynamic functionalities are handled by JavaScript. There is no restriction on which framework or library you must use.
    APIs
    Server side operations are abstracted into reusable APIs and accessed over HTTPS with JavaScript. These can be third party services or your custom function.
    Markup
    Websites are served as static HTML files. These can be generated from source files, such as Markdown, using a Static Site Generator.



    Terminology:
    API
    API is the acronym for Application Programming Interface. It defines interactions that allows two applications to talk to each other.



    What is the use case?
    JAMstack while not suffering from a shortage of virtues is not a one size fits all solution!
    Don’t use JAMstack when:

    You don’t generally do anything that consumes enough volume of static assets to cause your application to struggle with performance at least sometimes.
    Your development team is used to different tech, and the cost of migration is higher than the reward.
    You are dealing with tons of real-time/user data, (i.e. audio or video processing in real time)
    In most cases, it does not make sense to migrate a legacy project that is functioning just fine with no signs of depreciation on the horizon.

    What is Jamstack?
    Jamstack is an architecture designed to make the web faster, more secure, and easier to scale.The core tenants of pre-rendering, and decoupling, enable sites and applications to be delivered with greater confidence and resilience than ever before.
    Explore more of the benefits of Jamstack.

    Pre-rendering
    With Jamstack, the entire front end is prebuilt into highly optimized static pages and assets during a build process. This process of pre-rendering results in sites which can be served directly from a CDN, reducing the cost, complexity and risk, of dynamic servers as critical infrastructure.
    With so many popular tools for generating sites, like Gatsby, Hugo, Jekyll, Eleventy, NextJS, and very many more, many web developers are already familiar with the tools needed to become productive Jamstack developers.

    Enhancing with JavaScript
    With the markup and other user interface assets of Jamstack sites served directly from a CDN, they can be delivered very quickly and securely. On this foundation, Jamstack sites can use JavaScript and APIs to talk to backend services, allowing experiences to be enhanced and personalized.

    Supercharging with services
    The thriving API economy has become a significant enabler for Jamstack sites. The ability to leverage domain experts who offer their products and service via APIs has allowed teams to build far more complex applications than if they were to take on the risk and burden of such capabilities themselves. Now we can outsource things like authentication and identity, payments, content management, data services, search, and much more.
    Jamstack sites might utilise such services at build time, and also at run time directly from the browser via JavaScript. And the clean decoupling of these services allows for greater portability and flexibility, as well as significantly reduced risk.



    The real power of JAMstack development is easiest to grasp when compared with CMS-driven dynamic websites. It’s easy to forget the sheer number of steps required to fulfill a single page request, and the complexity of the operations that are constantly performed on the server to generate the final HTML received by the user’s browser.



    When a user requests a page, your server queries a MySQL database and uses a PHP interpreter, combined with data from the active theme and plugins, to stitch together an HTML document which can then be served to the user’s browser. What this extraordinarily complex operation amounts to, in essence, is templating. Given that even a modest blog is far too complex to code every page by hand, this method of dividing content into reusable components and automating the assembly makes sense.
    But why does this templating operation need to happen on the server? Do we really need databases and server-side software (which opens up dozens of security holes along the way) just to create a simple blog? At a time when browsers themselves have become operating systems, capable of interacting with countless APIs and running complex applications client-side, and when front-end development is dominated by JavaScript-based automation using npm, haven’t we outgrown this model?



    Static site generators like Jekyll and Hugo are part of what makes this possible. They essentially replace PHP as our templating system, but instead of running on a server and generating content on-the-fly, they run locally as part of your development process. Your HTML is generated up-front, and your website — now a collection of easily-cached static files — can be distributed to users by a blisteringly fast CDN (content distribution network).

    -source







    Common Features Of The Jamstack Workflow:
    Content delivery network
    Since all the markup and assets are pre-built, they can be served via CDN. This provides better performance and easier scalability.
    Atomic deploys
    Each deploy is a full snapshot of the site. This helps guarantee a consistent version of the site globally.
    Cache invalidation
    Once your build is uploaded, the CDN invalidates its cache. This means that your new build is live in an instant.
    Everything in version control
    Your codebase lives in Version Control System, such as Git. The main benefits are: change history of every file, collaborators and traceability.
    Automated builds
    Your server is notified when a new build is required, typically via webhooks. Server builds the project, updates the CDNs and the site is live.



    Getting started
    DEVELOPMENT
    However you decide to generate your HTML assets is up to you. The three most common approaches are:
    Hand coding
    Simple and effective method of writing HTML, it’s ideal for super simple pages.
    Static Site Generators
    Most JAMstack sites are powered by a static site generator. There’s no enforcement on which SSG you decide to use.

    Gatsby
    Next.js
    Hugo

    Frontend Framework
    Most frameworks don’t output static HTML files, however it is possible to do that but it requires more tooling experience and maintenance.

    React
    Preact

    DEPLOYMENT
    Your built site needs to be hosted somewhere. There are great services that provides this for free and with ease.

    Netlify
    Vercel
    Github Pages




    DYNAMIC PARTS
    JAMstack websites don’t have to be static. There are great services available to help bring some dynamic data to your product.
    Custom functions
    You can also abstract your own functions into reusable APIs. For this you can use AWS lambda functions or Netlify Functions
    Custom data
    As you add features to your site, you may want to store user profiles, shopping cart data, game levels, or other dynamic data. Get started for free with FaunaDB Serverless GraphQL
    Comments
    Many JAMstack products have dynamic comment sections. These are typically used on blogs
    Forms
    A great way to interact with your audience
    E-Commerce
    Setting up an online store on the JAMstack has never been easier
    Search
    Rely on third party services to integrate a search functionality



    CMS
    JAMstack sites can also be controlled via a Content Management System, these are typically known as Headless CMS. Once a change in the CMS is made, a new build of your site will be triggered and then deployed as static assets.

    Netlify CMS
    Contentful
    Headless WordPress
    Ghost
    Strapi
    Forestry
    Sanity.io
    Kontent
    GraphCMS
    TakeShape




    Best Practice:

    Using CDNs for hosting. Using content delivery networks improves performance and scalability.
    Atomic deploys. Deploying lots of static files can be time-consuming. But with atomic deploys, you can forget about downtimes. Your app is always available to users, even when a new deployment is being executed. Besides, with each deploy being a full snapshot of your website, it guarantees global consistency.
    Instant cache invalidation. CDNs store sites in their local caches. Thus, when you change something on your website, your CDN invalidates the affected files and replaces them with the new ones. However, the process can take hours. To avoid this, it’s recommended to choose CDNs with instant cache validation.
    Version control systems. A version control system, such as Git, is a cloud for your code. It hosts your source code, keeps track of all changes, and streamlines collaboration. If a mistake is made, developers can easily compare the current code from its previous versions and identify the cause.
    Automated builds. In terms of web development, build is a process of converting files and other assets into a final software product ready for deployment. Automating this process eliminates the risk of variation and defects. Besides, whenever a new build is required, your CDN is notified using webhooks.

    As pointed out in a previous article that deals with reading data from files, file handling belongs to the essential knowledge of every professional Python programmer. This feature is a core part of the Python language, and no extra module needs to be loaded to do it properly.
    Basics of Writing Files in Python
    The common methods to operate with files are open() to open a file, seek() to set the file’s current position at the given offset, and close() to close the file afterwards. The open() method returns a file handle that represents a file object to be used to access the file for reading, writing, or appending.
    Writing to a file requires a few decisions — the name of the file in which to store data and the access mode of the file. Available are two modes, writing to a new file (and overwriting any existing data) and appending data at the end of a file that already exists. The according abbreviations are “w”, and “a”, and have to be specified before opening a file.
    In this article we will explain how to write data to a file line by line, as a list of lines, and appending data at the end of a file.
    Writing a Single Line to a File
    This first example is pretty similar to writing to files with the popular programming languages C and C++, as you’ll see in Listing 1. The process is pretty straightforward. First, we open the file using the open() method for writing, write a single line of text to the file using the write() method, and then close the file using the close() method. Keep in mind that due to the way we opened the “helloworld.txt” file it will either be created if it does not exist yet, or it will be completely overwritten.
    filehandle = open('helloworld.txt', 'w')
    filehandle.write('Hello, world!\n')
    filehandle.close()
    Listing 1
    This entire process can be shortened using the with statement. Listing 2 shows how to write that. As already said before keep in mind that by opening the “helloworld.txt” file this way will either create if it does not exist yet or completely overwritten, otherwise.
    with open('helloworld.txt', 'w') as filehandle:
        filehandle.write('Hello, world!\n')
    Listing 2
    Writing a List of Lines to a File
    In reality a file does not consist only of a single line, but much more data. Therefore, the contents of the file are stored in a list that represents a file buffer. To write the entire file buffer we’ll use the writelines() method. Listing 3 gives you an example of this.
    filehandle = open("helloworld.txt", "w")
    filebuffer = ["a first line of text", "a second line of text", "a third line"]
    filehandle.writelines(filebuffer)
    filehandle.close()
    Listing 3
    Running the Python program shown in Listing 3 and then using the cat command we can see that the file “helloworld.txt” has the following content:
    $ cat helloworld.txt
    a first line of text a second line of text a third line
    Listing 4
    This happens because the writelines() method does not automatically add any line separators when writing the data. Listing 5 shows how to achieve that, writing each line of text on a single line by adding the line separator “\n”. Using a generator expression each line is substituted by the line plus line separator. Again, you can formulate this using the with statement.
    with open('helloworld.txt', 'w') as filehandle:
        filebuffer = ["a line of text", "another line of text", "a third line"]
        filehandle.writelines("%s\n" % line for line in filebuffer)
    Listing 5
    Now, the output file “helloworld.txt” has the desired content as shown in Listing 6:
    $ cat helloworld.txt
    a first line of text
    a second line of text
    a third line
    Listing 6
    Interestingly, there is a way to use output redirection in Python to write data to files. Listing 7 shows how to code that for Python 2.x.
    filename = "helloworld.txt"
    filecontent = ["Hello, world", "a second line", "and a third line"]
    with open(filename, 'w') as filehandle:
    for line in filecontent:
        print &gt;&gt;filehandle, line</code></pre>

    Listing 7
    For the latest Python releases this does not work in the same way anymore. To do something like this we must use the sys module. It allows us to access the UNIX standard output channels via sys.stdout, sys.stdin, and sys.stderr.
    In our case we preserve the original value of the output channel sys.stdout, first (line 8 in the code below), redefine it to the handle of our output file,
    next (line 15), print the data as usual (line 18), and finally restore the original value of the output channel sys.stdout (line 21). Listing 8 contains the example code.
    import sys
    filename = "helloworld.txt"
    original = sys.stdout
    filecontent = ["Hello, world", "a second line", "and a third line"]
    with open(filename, 'w') as filehandle:
    sys.stdout = filehandle
     
    for line in filecontent:
        print(line)
     

    sys.stdout = original</code></pre>

    Listing 8
    This is not necessarily best practice, but it does give you other options for writing lines to a file.
    Appending Data to a File
    So far, we have stored data in new files or in overwritten data in existing files. But what if we want to append data to the end of an existing file? In this case we would need to open the existing file using a different access mode. We change that to ‘a’ instead of ‘w’.
    Listing 9 shows how to handle that. And Listing 10 does the same thing, but it uses the with statement rather.
    filehandle = open('helloworld.txt','a')
    filehandle.write('\n' + 'Hello, world!\n')
    filehandle.close()
    Listing 9
    with open('helloworld.txt', 'a') as filehandle:
        filehandle.write('\n' + 'Hello, world!\n')
    Listing 10
    Using the same helloworld.txt file from before, running this code will produce the following file contents:
    $ cat helloworld.txt
    Hello, world
    a second line
    and a third line
    Hello, world!
    Conclusion
    Writing plain text data to files, or appending data to existing files, is as easy as reading from files in Python. As soon as a file is closed after writing or appending data, Python triggers a synchronization call. As a result, the updated file is immediately written to disk.
