- way we analyze how efficient algorithms are without getting too mired in details - can model how much time any function will take given `n` inputs - interested in order of magnitude of number of the exact figure - O absorbs all fluff and n = biggest term - Big O of `3x^2 +x + 1` = `O(n^2)`

### Time Complexity

no loops or exit & return = O(1)

0 nested loops = `O(n)`\
1 nested loops = `O(n^2)`\
2 nested loops = `O(n^3)`\
3 nested loops = `O(n^4)`

**recursive**: as you add more terms, increase in time as you add input diminishes\
**recursion**: when you define something in terms of itself, a function that calls itself

- used because of ability to maintain state at diffferent levels of recursion
- inherently carries large footprint
- every time function called, you add call to stack

**iterative**: use loops instead of recursion (preferred)

- favor readability over performance

`O(n log(n))` & `O(log(n))`: dividing/halving

- if code employs recursion/divide-and-conquer strategy
- what power do i need to power my base to get n

### Time Definitions

- **constant**: does not scale with input, will take same amount of time
- for any input size n, constant time performs same number of operations every time
- **logarithmic**: increases number of operations it performs as logarithmic function of input size n
- function log n grows very slowly, so as n gets longer, number of operations the algorithm needs to perform doesn't increase very much
- halving
- **linear**: increases number of operations it performs as linear function of input size n
- number of additional operations needed to perform grows in direct proportion to increase in input size n
- **log-linear**: increases number of operations it performs as log-linear function of input size n
- looking over every element and doing work on each one
- **quadratic**: increases number of operations it performs as quadratic function of input size n
- **exponential**: increases number of operations it performs as exponential function of input size n
- number of nested loops increases as function of n
- **polynomial**: as size of input increases, runtime/space used will grow at a faster rate
- **factorial**: as size of input increases, runtime/space used will grow astronomically even with relatively small inputs
- **rate of growth**: how fast a function grows with input size

### Space Complexity

- How does the space usage scale/change as input gets very large?
- What auxiliary space does your algorithm use or is it in place (constant)?
- Runtime stack space counts as part of space complexity unless told otherwise.

### Sorting Algorithms

# Array Callback Methods Implemented With For Loops

How to implement array callback methods in JavaScript

### Array Callback Methods Implemented With For Loops

#### How to implement array callback methods in JavaScript

[![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/66698fc55382cdcada06a280bbd01030f2d8b3a1f6590aa4b380086ac26537b3/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f3830302f302a57704b714f6454735450687661707557)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/66698fc55382cdcada06a280bbd01030f2d8b3a1f6590aa4b380086ac26537b3/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f3830302f302a57704b714f6454735450687661707557)

#### Functions are called "First Class Objects" in JavaScript because:

- A function is an instance of the Object type
- A function can have properties and has a link back to its constructor method
- You can store the function in a variable
- You can pass the function as a parameter to another function
- You can return the function from a function

What do you think will be printed in the following:

#### Anonymous callback, a named callback

```
function foo(callback) {
    console.log('grape');
    callback();
}

function bar() {
    console.log('banana');
}

const fruitBasket = function() {
    console.log('apple');
    bar();
    foo(bar);
    foo(function() {
        console.log('orange');
    });
    console.log('pear');
};

fruitBasket();

```

#### Function that takes in a value and two callbacks. The function should return the result of the callback who's invocation results in a larger value.

```
function greaterValue(value, cb1, cb2) {
    // compare cb1 invoked with value to cb2 invoked with value
    // return the greater result

    let res1 = cb1(value);
    let res2 = cb2(value);
    if (res1 > res2) {
        // if this is false, we move out of if statement
        return res1;
    }
    return res2;
}

let negate = function(num) {
    return num * -1;
};

let addOne = function(num) {
    return num + 1;
};

console.log(greaterValue(3, negate, addOne));
console.log(greaterValue(-2, negate, addOne));

```

*Note: we do not invoke* `negate` *or* `addOne` *(by using* `()` *to call them), we are passing the function itself.*

#### Write a function, myMap, that takes in an array and a callback as arguments. The function should mimic the behavior of Array.prototype.map.

```
function myMap(arr, callback) {
    // iterate through the array, perform the cb on each element
    // return a new array with those new values
    let mapped = [];

    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        // remember that map passes three args with each element.
        let val = callback(arr[i], i, arr);
        mapped.push(val);
    }

    return mapped;
}

let double = function(num) {
    return num * 2;
};
console.log(myMap([1, 2, 3], double));

```

#### Write a function, myFilter, that takes in an array and a callback as arguments. The function should mimic the behavior of Array.prototype.filter.

```
function myFilter(arr, callback) {
    let filtered = [];

    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        let element = arr[i];

        if (callback(element, i, arr)) {
            filtered.push(element);
        }
    }

    return filtered;
}

```

#### Write a function, myEvery, that takes in an array and a callback as arguments. The function should mimic the behavior of Array.prototype.every.

```
function myEvery(arr, callback) {
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        let element = arr[i];

        if (callback(element, i, arr) === false) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}

```

### Further Examples of the above concepts

```
const createMeowValue = () => {
  console.log(this.name);
  let meow = function () {
    console.log(this);
    console.log(this.name + ' meows');
  }
  meow = meow.bind(this);
  return meow;
};

const name = 'Fluffy';

const cat = {
  name: name,
  age: 12,
  createMeow: function () {
    console.log(this.name);
    let meow = () => {
      const hello = 'hello';
      console.log(this.name + ' meows');
    };
    let world = '';
    if (true) {
      world = 'world';
    }
    console.log(world);
    // meow = meow.bind(this);
    return meow;
  }
};

cat.newKey = function () {
  const outermostContext = this;
  const innerFunc = () => {
    secondContext = this;
    console.log(secondContext === outermostContext)
    return function () {
      innermostContext = this;
    }
  };
  return innerFunc.bind(outermostContext);
};

const meow = cat.createMeow(); // method-style invocation
meow(); // function-style invocation

console.log('-------')

const createMeow = cat.createMeow;
const globalMeow = createMeow(); // function-style
globalMeow(); // function-style

function createSmoothie(ingredient) {
  const ingredients = [ingredient];
  return ingredients;
}

// console.log(createSmoothie('banana'));
// console.log(createSmoothie('apple'));

// one parameter only
// first argument is a string
// return an array
// DO NOT USE forEach

### Here's a Cheatsheet:

### Getting Started (Advanced Users Skip Section):

---

#### ✔ Check the Current Directory ➡ `pwd`:

On the command line, it's important to know the directory we are currently working on. For that, we can use `pwd` command.

[![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/ede56713024434b9c0c8008f54475a7f4fcdcd15427580cbc504793e43a15b6d/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f3830302f302a64696d7a4c55726d44493455666576362e676966)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/ede56713024434b9c0c8008f54475a7f4fcdcd15427580cbc504793e43a15b6d/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f3830302f302a64696d7a4c55726d44493455666576362e676966)

It shows that I'm working on my Desktop directory.

#### ✔ Display List of Files ➡ `ls`:

To see the list of files and directories in the current directory use `ls` command in your CLI.

[![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/e9cfe3bfa6f8d2ff3cc9f7959a7896facb58708e7e707d012ad989edb589b6ec/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f3830302f302a48487a56724b324374545077546459542e676966)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/e9cfe3bfa6f8d2ff3cc9f7959a7896facb58708e7e707d012ad989edb589b6ec/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f3830302f302a48487a56724b324374545077546459542e676966)

Shows all of my files and directories of my Desktop directory.

- To show the contents of a directory pass the directory name to the `ls` command i.e. `ls directory_name`.
- Some useful `ls` command options:-

OptionDescriptionls -alist all files including hidden file starting with '.'ls -llist with the long formatls -lalist long format including hidden files

#### ✔ Create a Directory ➡ `mkdir`:

We can create a new folder using the `mkdir` command. To use it type `mkdir folder_name`.

[![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/8c10a898b8f52be59dc0723ab2dd0784c22c12a325ffe5cc64a38f07341ef90e/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f3830302f302a6d33644479433976524a42555a5378522e676966)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/8c10a898b8f52be59dc0723ab2dd0784c22c12a325ffe5cc64a38f07341ef90e/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f3830302f302a6d33644479433976524a42555a5378522e676966)

Use `ls` command to see the directory is created or not.

I created a cli-practice directory in my working directory i.e. Desktop directory.

#### ✔ Move Between Directories ➡ `cd`:

It's used to change directory or to move other directories. To use it type `cd directory_name`.

[![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/d78e325dda59d59be4bd151dd85d3b1966324cb205da2eb540f1372e8195b280/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f3830302f302a33344b4778543247386f4e4d446e49632e676966)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/d78e325dda59d59be4bd151dd85d3b1966324cb205da2eb540f1372e8195b280/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f3830302f302a33344b4778543247386f4e4d446e49632e676966)

Can use `pwd` command to confirm your directory name.

Changed my directory to the cli-practice directory. And the rest of the tutorial I'm gonna work within this directory.

#### ✔ Parent Directory ➡ `..`:

We have seen `cd` command to change directory but if we want to move back or want to move to the parent directory we can use a special symbol `..` after `cd` command, like `cd ..`

#### ✔ Create Files ➡ `touch`:

We can create an empty file by typing `touch file_name`. It's going to create a new file in the current directory (the directory you are currently in) with your provided name.

[![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/97e82f91cb8cfcf342cf97e8b572b49d1bc264cbe9929c7e23d0f72589d6708d/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f3830302f302a78753177747637674a324e4d765036302e676966)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/97e82f91cb8cfcf342cf97e8b572b49d1bc264cbe9929c7e23d0f72589d6708d/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f3830302f302a78753177747637674a324e4d765036302e676966)

I created a hello.txt file in my current working directory. Again you can use `ls` command to see the file is created or not.

Now open your hello.txt file in your text editor and write *Hello Everyone!* into your hello.txt file and save it.

#### ✔ Display the Content of a File ➡ `cat`:

We can display the content of a file using the `cat` command. To use it type `cat file_name`.

[![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/ffe71e48a1a9bd9b118265c18a81e0b49a515cf40453416134dfca52567bb82c/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f3830302f302a694b6635773951464e43654c527638612e676966)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/ffe71e48a1a9bd9b118265c18a81e0b49a515cf40453416134dfca52567bb82c/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f3830302f302a694b6635773951464e43654c527638612e676966)

Shows the content of my hello.txt file.

#### ✔ Move Files & Directories ➡ `mv`:

To move a file and directory, we use `mv` command.

By typing `mv file_to_move destination_directory`, you can move a file to the specified directory.

By entering `mv directory_to_move destination_directory`, you can move all the files and directories under that directory.

Before using this command, we are going to create two more directories and another txt file in our cli-practice directory.

`mkdir html css touch bye.txt`

Yes, we can use multiple directories & files names one after another to create multiple directories & files in one command.

[![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/5db5a79472f5bffa91c5bfd8c892437523b68072d930c7b4334c8b622ecb55de/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f3830302f302a356a6d6a5f5a794e7a34364775514b7a2e676966)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/5db5a79472f5bffa91c5bfd8c892437523b68072d930c7b4334c8b622ecb55de/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f3830302f302a356a6d6a5f5a794e7a34364775514b7a2e676966)

Moved my bye.txt file into my css directory and then moved my css directory into my html directory.

#### ✔ Rename Files & Directories ➡ `mv`:

`mv` command can also be used to rename a file and a directory.

You can rename a file by typing `mv old_file_name new_file_name` & also rename a directory by typing `mv old_directory_name new_directory_name`.

[![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/3feb1289a79b907796c1d736e119730dc3d2dbcd60c6ba072ee226cc8cb69b75/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f3830302f302a575456753164643667722d6e6d5768442e676966)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/3feb1289a79b907796c1d736e119730dc3d2dbcd60c6ba072ee226cc8cb69b75/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f3830302f302a575456753164643667722d6e6d5768442e676966)

Renamed my hello.txt file to the hi.txt file and html directory to the folder directory.

#### ✔ Copy Files & Directories ➡ `cp`:

To do this, we use the `cp` command.

- You can copy a file by entering `cp file_to_copy new_file_name`.

[![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/9b67b2ef374ba0f1457b24007824ea5b65ca861a100397322d1a13f30a70818f/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f3830302f302a6b434c56744b4e396f4b5062486652462e676966)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/9b67b2ef374ba0f1457b24007824ea5b65ca861a100397322d1a13f30a70818f/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f3830302f302a6b434c56744b4e396f4b5062486652462e676966)

Copied my hi.txt file content into hello.txt file. For confirmation open your hello.txt file in your text editor.

- You can also copy a directory by adding the `-r` option, like `cp -r directory_to_copy new_directory_name`.

*The* `-r` *option for "recursive" means that it will copy all of the files including the files inside of subfolders.*

Here I copied all of the files from the folder to folder-copy.

#### ✔ Remove Files & Directories ➡ `rm`:

To do this, we use the `rm` command.

- To remove a file, you can use the command like `rm file_to_remove`.

[![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/e35ef5a179966ed8271639d381b997455862bb77794f0b8c219f7ffada7168da/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f3830302f302a6f68436d6474686439325f4841365a652e676966)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/e35ef5a179966ed8271639d381b997455862bb77794f0b8c219f7ffada7168da/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f3830302f302a6f68436d6474686439325f4841365a652e676966)

I removed my folder-copy directory from my cli-practice directory i.e. current working directory.

#### ✔ Clear Screen ➡ `clear`:

Clear command is used to clear the terminal screen.

#### ✔ Home Directory ➡ `~`:

The Home directory is represented by `~`. The Home directory refers to the base directory for the user. If we want to move to the Home directory we can use `cd ~` command. Or we can only use `cd` command.

### MY COMMANDS:

### 1.) Recursively unzip zip files and then delete the archives when finished:

**here is a** [**folde**](https://github.com/bgoonz/bash-commands-walkthrough/tree/master/steps/1-recursive-unzip)**r containing the before and after... I had to change folder names slightly due to a limit on the length of file-paths in a github repo.**

```
find . -name "*.zip" | while read filename; do unzip -o -d "`dirname "$filename"`" "$filename"; done;

find . -name "*.zip" -type f -print -delete

```

---

### 2.) Install node modules recursively:

```
npm i -g recursive-install

npm-recursive-install

```

---

### 3.) Clean up unnecessary files/folders in git repo:

```
find . -empty -type f -print -delete #Remove empty files

# -------------------------------------------------------
find . -empty -type d -print -delete #Remove empty folders

# -------------------------------------------------------

# This will remove .git folders...    .gitmodule files as well as .gitattributes and .gitignore files.

find . \( -name ".git" -o -name ".gitignore" -o -name ".gitmodules" -o -name ".gitattributes" \) -exec rm -rf -- {} +

# -------------------------------------------------------

# This will remove the filenames you see listed below that just take up space if a repo has been downloaded for use exclusively in your personal file system (in which case the following files just take up space)# Disclaimer... you should not use this command in a repo that you intend to use with your work as it removes files that attribute the work to their original creators!

find . \( -name "*SECURITY.txt" -o -name "*RELEASE.txt" -o -name "*CHANGELOG.txt" -o -name "*LICENSE.txt" -o -name "*CONTRIBUTING.txt" -name "*HISTORY.md" -o -name "*LICENSE" -o -name "*SECURITY.md" -o -name "*RELEASE.md" -o -name "*CHANGELOG.md" -o -name "*LICENSE.md" -o -name "*CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md" -o -name "\*CONTRIBUTING.md" \) -exec rm -rf -- {} +

```

badFolder Implementing Private Fields for JavaScript

When implementing a language feature for JavaScript, an implementer must make decisions about how the language in the specification maps to the implementation. Private fields is an example of where the specification language and implementation reality diverge, at least in SpiderMonkey-- the JavaScript engine which powers Firefox. To understand more, I'll explain what private fields are, a couple of models for thinking about them, and explain why our implementation diverges from the specification language.The post Implementing Private Fields for JavaScript appeared first on Mozilla Hacks - the Web developer blog.

Looking fine with Firefox 89

Firefox 89 has smartened up and brings with it a slimmed-down, slightly more minimalist interface.badFolder Along with this new look, we get some great styling features including a force-colours feature for media queries and better control over how fonts are displayed. The long-awaited top-level await keyword for JavaScript modules is now enabled, as well as the PerformanceEventTiming interface, which is another addition to the performance suite of APIs: 89 really has been working out!The post Looking fine with Firefox 89 appeared first on Mozilla Hacks - the Web developer blog.

### 7.) Execute command recursively:

**Here I have modified the command I wish to run recursively to account for the fact that the 'find' command already works recursively, by appending the -maxdepth 1 flag...**

> **I am essentially removing the recursive action of the find command...**

**That way, if the command affects the more deeply nested folders we know the outer RecurseDirs function we are using to run the *find/pandoc* line once in every subfolder of the working directory... is working properly!**

### TBC....

**Here are some of the other commands I will cover in greater detail... at a later time:**

### 9\. Copy any text between <script> tags in a file called example.html to be inserted into a new file: out.js

```
sed -n -e '/<script>/,/<\/script>/p' example.html >out.js

```

---

### 10\. Recursively Delete node_modules folders

```
find . -name 'node_modules' -type d -print -prune -exec rm -rf '{}' +

```

---

### 11\. Sanatize file and folder names to remove illegal characters and reserved words.

```
sanitize() {
  shopt -s extglob;

  filename=$(basename "$1")
  directory=$(dirname "$1")

  filename_clean=$(echo "$filename" | sed -e 's/[\\/:\*\?"<>\|\x01-\x1F\x7F]//g' -e 's/^\(nul\|prn\|con\|lpt[0-9]\|com[0-9]\|aux\)\(\.\|$\)//i' -e 's/^\.*$//' -e 's/^$/NONAME/')

  if (test "$filename" != "$filename_clean")
  then
    mv -v "$1" "$directory/$filename_clean"
  fi
}

export -f sanitize

sanitize_dir() {
  find "$1" -depth -exec bash -c 'sanitize "$0"' {} \;

}

sanitize_dir '/path/to/somewhere'

```

---

### 12\. Start postgresql in terminal

```
sudo -u postgres psql

```

---

### 13\. Add closing body and script tags to each html file in working directory.

```
for f in * ; do
  mv "$f" "$f.html"
doneecho "<form>
 <input type="button" value="Go back!" onclick="history.back()">
</form>
  </body></html>" | tee -a *.html

```

---

### 14\. Batch Download Videos

```
#!/bin/bash

link="#insert url here#"
#links were a set of strings with just the index of the video as the variable

num=3
#first video was numbered 3 - weird.

Test if you have Ubuntu installed by typing "Ubuntu" in the search box in the bottom app bar that reads "Type here to search". If you see a search result that reads **"Ubuntu 20.04 LTS"** with "App" under it, then you have it installed.

‌

1.  In the application search box in the bottom bar, type "PowerShell" to find the application named "Windows PowerShell"
2.  Right-click on "Windows PowerShell" and choose "Run as administrator" from the popup menu
3.  In the blue PowerShell window, type the following: `Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux`
4.  Restart your computer
5.  In the application search box in the bottom bar, type "Store" to find the application named "Microsoft Store"
6.  Click "Microsoft Store"
7.  Click the "Search" button in the upper-right corner of the window
8.  Type in "Ubuntu"
9.  Click "Run Linux on Windows (Get the apps)"
10. Click the orange tile labeled **"Ubuntu"** Note that there are 3 versions in the Microsoft Store... you want the one just entitled 'Ubuntu'
11. Click "Install"
12. After it downloads, click "Launch"
13. If you get the option, pin the application to the task bar. Otherwise, right-click on the orange Ubuntu icon in the task bar and choose "Pin to taskbar"
14. When prompted to "Enter new UNIX username", type your first name with no spaces
15. When prompted, enter and retype a password for this UNIX user (it can be the same as your Windows password)
16. Confirm your installation by typing the command `whoami 'as in who-am-i'`followed by Enter at the prompt (it should print your first name)
17. You need to update your packages, so type `sudo apt update` (if prompted for your password, enter it)
18. You need to upgrade your packages, so type `sudo apt upgrade` (if prompted for your password, enter it)

### Git

Git comes with Ubuntu, so there's nothing to install. However, you should configure it using the following instructions.

‌Open an Ubuntu terminal if you don't have one open already.

1.  You need to configure Git, so type `git config --global user.name "Your Name"` with replacing "Your Name" with your real name.
2.  You need to configure Git, so type `git config --global user.email your@email.com` with replacing "[](mailto:your@email.com)<your@email.com>" with your real email.

**Note: if you want git to remember your login credentials type:**

```
$ git config --global credential.helper store

```

‌

### Google Chrome

Test if you have Chrome installed by typing "Chrome" in the search box in the bottom app bar that reads "Type here to search". If you see a search result that reads "Chrome" with "App" under it, then you have it installed. Otherwise, follow these instructions to install Google Chrome.

‌

1.  Open Microsoft Edge, the blue "e" in the task bar, and type in [](http://chrome.google.com/)[http://chrome.google.com](http://chrome.google.com/). Click the "Download Chrome" button. Click the "Accept and Install" button after reading the terms of service. Click "Save" in the "What do you want to do with ChromeSetup.exe" dialog at the bottom of the window. When you have the option to "Run" it, do so. Answer the questions as you'd like. Set it as the default browser.
2.  Right-click on the Chrome icon in the task bar and choose "Pin to taskbar".

### Node.js

Test if you have Node.js installed by opening an Ubuntu terminal and typing `node --version`. If it reports "Command 'node' not found", then you need to follow these directions.

1.  In the Ubuntu terminal, type `sudo apt update` and press Enter
2.  In the Ubuntu terminal, type `sudo apt install build-essential` and press Enter
3.  In the Ubuntu terminal, type `curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.35.2/install.sh | bash` and press Enter
4.  In the Ubuntu terminal, type `. ./.bashrc` and press Enter
5.  In the Ubuntu terminal, type `nvm install --lts` and press Enter
6.  Confirm that **node** is installed by typing `node --version` and seeing it print something that is not "Command not found"!

### Unzip

You will often have to download a zip file and unzip it. It is easier to do this from the command line. So we need to install a linux unzip utility.

‌In the Ubuntu terminal type: `sudo apt install unzip` and press Enter

‌Mocha.js

Test if you have Mocha.js installed by opening an Ubuntu terminal and typing `which mocha`. If it prints a path, then you're good. Otherwise, if it prints nothing, install Mocha.js by typing `npm install -g mocha`.

‌

### Python 3

Ubuntu does not come with Python 3. Install it using the command `sudo apt install python3`. Test it by typing `python3 --version` and seeing it print a number.

‌

### Note about WSL

‌

As of the time of writing of this document, WSL has an issue renaming or deleting files if Visual Studio Code is open. So before doing any linux commands which manipulate files, make sure you **close** Visual Studio Code before running those commands in the Ubuntu terminal.

Here I will walk through a demo.... skip down below for more fundamental examples and resources...

### React Demo

- ex1 --- A Basic React Component
- ex2 --- A Basic React Class Component
- ex3 --- A Class Component with State
- ex4 --- A Class Component that Updates State
- ex5 --- A Class Component that Iterates through State
- ex6 --- An Example of Parent and Child Components

With regards to converting an existing HTML, CSS, and JS site into React, first you'll want to think about how to break up your site into components,

- as well as think about what the general hierarchical component structure of your site will look like.
- From there, it's a simple matter of copying the relevant HTML for that component and throwing it into the **render method of your component file.**
- _Any methods that are needed for that component to function properly can added onto your new component._

Once you've refactored your HTML components into React components, you'll want to lay them out in the desired hierarchical structure

- with children components being rendered by their parents, as well as ensuring that the parent components are passing down the necessary data as props to their children components.

ex.)

```
<!-- Hello world -->
<div class="awesome" style="border: 1px solid red">
  <label for="name">Enter your name: </label>
  <input type="text" id="name" />
</div>
<p>Enter your HTML here</p>

```

Is equivalent to:

### A Basic Component

A component is some thing that is being rendered in the browser. It could be a button, a form with a bunch of fields in it...etc....

React doesn't place any restrictions on how large or small a component can be.

You *could* have an entire static site encapsulated in a single React component, but that would defeat the purpose of using React.

So the first thing to remember about a component is that a **component must *render* something.**

_If nothing is being rendered from a component, then React will throw an error._

Inside of `BasicComponent.js` , first import React at the top of the file. Our most basic of components looks like this:

> _This is a component that simply returns a div tag with the words Hello World! inside._

> _The last line simply exports our component so that it can be imported\
> by another file._

Notice that this component looks exactly like an anonymous arrow function that we've named `BasicComponent` .

In fact, that is literally what this is.

The arrow function then is simply returning the div tag. When a component is written as a function like this one is, it is called a *functional* component.

### A Basic Class Component

The above component is an example of a functional component, which is appropriate since that component is literally nothing more than a function that returns some HTML.

_Functional components are great when all you want a component to do is to render some stuff._

_Components can also be written as classes (although this paradigm is becoming outdated and you should strive to write your components functionally!_

For this exercise, we're going to write a class component that does exactly the same thing as the functional component we just wrote.

We'll again need to import React at the top of the file, but we'll also need to add a little something. Our import statement will look like this:

```
import React, { Component } from 'react';

```

**So, in addition to importing React, we're also importing the base Component class that is included in the React library.**

#### React lets you define components as classes or functions.

Components defined as classes currently provide more features . To define a React component class, you need to extend `React.Component`:

```
class Welcome extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;
  }
}

```

**The only method you *must* define in a** `React.Component` **subclass is called** `render()`**.**

### `render()`

The `render()` method is the only required method in a class component.

When called, it should examine `this.props` and `this.state` and return one of the following types:

- **React elements.** Typically created via [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html). For example, `<div />` and `<MyComponent />` are React elements that instruct React to render a DOM node, or another user-defined component, respectively.
- **Arrays and fragments.** Let you return multiple elements from render. See the documentation on [fragments](https://reactjs.org/docs/fragments.html) for more details.
- **Portals**. Let you render children into a different DOM subtree. See the documentation on [portals](https://reactjs.org/docs/portals.html) for more details.
- **String and numbers.** These are rendered as text nodes in the DOM.
- **Booleans or** `null`. Render nothing. (Mostly exists to support `return test && <Child />` pattern, where `test` is boolean.)

The `render()` function should be pure, meaning that it does not modify component state, it returns the same result each time it's invoked, and it does not directly interact with the browser.

If you need to interact with the browser, perform your work in `componentDidMount()` or the other lifecycle methods instead. Keeping `render()` pure makes components easier to think about.

> _Note_

> `render()` *will not be invoked if* `shouldComponentUpdate()` *returns false.*

The export statement at the bottom of the file also stays, completely unchanged. Our class component will thus look like this:

**Notice that our** `BasicClassComponent` **inherits from the base** `Component` **class that we imported from the React library, by virtue of the 'extends' keyword.**

_That being said, there's nothing in this minimal component that takes advantage of any of those inherited methods._

**All we have is a method on our component class called** `render` **that returns the same div tag.**

If we really were deciding between whether to use a functional component versus a class component to render a simple div tag, then the functional style is more appropriate to use.

This is because class components are much better suited for handling component state and triggering events based on the component's [lifecycle.](https://projects.wojtekmaj.pl/react-lifecycle-methods-diagram/)

#### The important takeaways at this point are that there are two types of components, functional and class components, and that functional components are well-suited if you're just looking to render some HTML.

_Class components, on the other hand, are much better suited for handling components that require more complex functionality, need to exhibit more varied behavior, and/or need to keep track of some state that may change throughout said component's lifecycle._

### A Class Component with Some State

**Component state is any dynamic data that we want the component to keep track of.**

> For example, let's say we have a form component. This form has some input fields that we'd like users to fill out. When a user types characters into an input field, how is that input persisted from the point of view of our form component?

**The answer is by using component state!**

There are a few important concepts regarding component state, such as how to update it, pass it to another component, render it, etc.

**Only class components have the ability to persist state, so if at any time you realize that a component needs to keep track of some state, you know that you'll automatically need a class component instead of a functional component.**

> It is possible to handle state with functional components but that requires the use of something called the [useState() hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html). Hooks were added in React 16.8; prior to this release, there was no mechanism to add state to functional components.

Here's what the above component looks like as a functional component:

Our class component with state will look a lot like the basic class component we just wrote, but with some exceptions:

**So far, the only new thing going on here is the constructor block. If you recall how classes in JavaScript work, classes need constructors.**

**Additionally, if a class is extending off of another class and wants access to its parent class's methods and properties, then the** `super` **function needs to be called inside the class's constructor function.**

#### Point being, the constructor function and the call to the `super` function are *not* associated with React, they are associated with all JavaScript classes.

- Then there is the `this.state` **property inside the constructor function that is set as an empty object**.
- We're adding a property called `state` to our class and setting it to an empty object.

#### State objects in React are always just plain old objects.

#### **So why is it that the basic class component we wrote in the previous exercise had no constructor function within its body?**

That is because we had no need for them since all our class component was doing was rendering some HTML.

**The constructor is needed here because that is where we need to initialize our state object.**

**The call to** `super` **is needed because we can't reference** `this` **inside of our constructor without a call to** `super` **first.**

Ok, now let's actually use this state object.

_One very common application of state objects in React components is to render the data being stored inside them within our component's render function._

#### Refactoring our component class to do that:

We added a key-value pair to our state object inside our constructor.

- Then we changed the contents of the render function.
- Now, it's actually rendering the data that we have inside the state object.
- Notice that inside the div tags we're using a template string literal so that we can access the value of `this.state.someData` straight inside of our rendered content.

**With Reacts newest version, we can actually now add state to a component without explicitly defining a constructor on the class. We can refactor our class component to look like this:**

[![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/a502f0bfd7006a24e07bc8ce8c5e792c580002947fd750d15f16a7e2c78ec6af/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f313230302f312a3673596846554e70556b7436784e396b6b6e34704a512e706e67)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/a502f0bfd7006a24e07bc8ce8c5e792c580002947fd750d15f16a7e2c78ec6af/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f313230302f312a3673596846554e70556b7436784e396b6b6e34704a512e706e67)

This new syntax is what is often referred to as 'syntactic sugar': under the hood, the React library translates this back into the old constructor code that we first started with, so that the JavaScript remains valid to the JavaScript interpreter.

The clue to this is the fact that when we want to access some data from the state object, we still need to call it with `this.state.someData` ; changing it to just `state.someData` does not work.

### Class Component Updating State

Great, so we can render some state that our component persists for us.

However, we said an important use case of component state is to handle *dynamic* data.

A single static number isn't very dynamic at all.

So now let's walk through how to update component state.

Notice that we've added two methods to our class: `increment` and `decrement` .

`increment` and `decrement` are methods that *we* are adding to our class component.

Unlike the `render` method, `increment` and `decrement` were not already a part of our class component.

This is why `increment` and `decrement` are written as arrow functions, **_so that they are automatically bound to our class component._**

The alternative is using a declaration syntax function with the bind method to bind the context of our methods to the class component.

The more interesting thing is what is going on within the bodies of these methods.

#### Each calls the `setState` function.

- `setState` in fact *is* provided to us by React.

It is the standard way to update a component's state.

It's the *only* way you should ever update a component's state. It may seem more verbose than necessary, but there are good reasons for why you should be doing it this way.

#### So the way to use `setState` to update a component's state is to pass it an object with each of the state keys you wish to update, along with the updated value.

In our `increment` method we said "I would like to update the `aNumber` property on my component state by adding one to it and then setting the new value as my new `aNumber` ".

The same thing happens in our `decrement` method, only we're subtracting instead of adding.

Then the other new concept we're running into here is how to actually call these methods we've added to our class.

[![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/69d84a6ca16cc7bece512be554ff018644c09c238f4c4a34c3ea327f103bdd4d/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f3630302f312a6b3874355142634d76484458353231736434704334672e706e67)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/69d84a6ca16cc7bece512be554ff018644c09c238f4c4a34c3ea327f103bdd4d/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f3630302f312a6b3874355142634d76484458353231736434704334672e706e67)

We added two HTML button tags within our `render` function, then in their respective `onClick` handlers, we specify the method that should be called whenever this button gets clicked. So whenever we click either of the buttons, our state gets updated appropriately and our component will re-render to show the correct value we're expecting.

### Class Component Iterating State

Another common state pattern you'll see being used in React components is iterating over an array in our state object and rendering each array element in its own tag.

> This is often used in order to render lists.

Additionally, we want to be able to easily update lists and have React re-render our updated list.

We'll see how both of these are done and how they work together within a single component in order to create the behavior of a dynamic list.

The first change to note is that our state object now has an 'ingredients' array, and a 'newIngredient' field that has been initialized to an empty string.

The ingredients array contains the elements that we'll want to render in our list.

The `addIngredient` and `handleIngredientInput` methods we've added to our class receives a parameter called 'event'.

This event object is part of the browser's API.

When we interact with some DOM element, **such as clicking on an HTML button, the *function that is invoked upon that button being clicked* actually receives the event object.**

- So when we type some input into an input tag, we're able grab each character that was typed into the input field through the event object parameter.
- The `handleIngredientInput` method is what gets invoked every time the user presses a key to enter text in the input box for adding a new ingredient.
- Every character the user types gets persisted in the `newIngredient` field on the state object.

We're able to grab the text in the input box using `event.target.value`

**Which holds the value of the string text that is currently in the input box**.

> We use that to update our `newIngredient` string field.

Breaking down the `addIngredient` method, we see this `event.preventDefault()` invocation.

This is because this method will be used upon submitting a form, and it turns out that submitting a form triggers some default form behavior that we don't want to trigger when we submit the form (**namely refreshing the entire page**).

> `event.preventDefault()` will prevent this default form behavior, meaning our form will only do what we want it to do when it is submitted.

Next, we store a reference to `this.state.ingredients` in a variable called `ingredientsList` .

So we now have a copy of the array that is stored in our state object.

**We want to update the copy of the ingredients array first instead of directly updating the actual array itself in state.**

Now we push whatever value is being stored at our `newIngredient` field onto the `ingredientsList` array so that our `ingredientsList` array is now more up-to-date than our `this.state.ingredients` array.

So all we have to do now is call `setState` appropriately in order to update the value in our state object.

Additionally, we also set the `newIngredient` field back to an empty string in order to clear out the input field once we submit a new ingredient.

Now it's ready to accept more user input!

Looking at our render function, first note the `this.state.ingredients.map` call.

This is looping through each ingredient in our `ingredients` array and returning each one within its own div tag.

This is a very common pattern for rendering everything inside an array.

Then we have an HTML form which contains an input field.

The purpose of this form is to allow a user to add new ingredients to the list. Note that we're passing our `addIngredient` method to the form's `onSubmit` handler.

This means that our `addIngredient` method gets invoked whenever our form is submitted.

Lastly, the input field has an `onChange` handler that invokes our `handleIngredientInput` method whenever there is some sort of change in the input field, namely when a user types into it.

[![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/7fe5eaa16711b23dc8c506a8ab92662ca7ee7a101b6e236dd85ad46b7ed7e923/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f3830302f312a5337733946666150566c4b4779615377466549645f772e706e67)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/7fe5eaa16711b23dc8c506a8ab92662ca7ee7a101b6e236dd85ad46b7ed7e923/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f3830302f312a5337733946666150566c4b4779615377466549645f772e706e67)

Notice that the `value` field in our input tag reads off of `this.state.newIngredient` in order to know what value to display.

So when a user enters text into the input field, the `onChange` handler is invoked every time, which updates our `this.state.newIngredient` field, which the input field and then renders.

### Parent and Child Components

A single isolated component isn't going to do us much good.

> The beauty of React lies in the fact that it allows us to compose modular components together.

> Let's start off with the component we just saw, but let's change its name to `ParentComponent` .

The only two other differences in this component are that we're importing a `ChildComponent` and then using it inside our `this.state.ingredients.map` call.

`ChildComponent` is another React component.

Notice that we're using it just as if it were any other HTML tag.

**This is how we lay out our component hierarchy: the ChildComponent is rendered within the ParentComponent.**

We can see this to be the case if we open up the developer console and inspect these elements.

[![child-left: parent-right](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/c141c7e91095463b29923cacde6f236181b993c8fd7d30f2494016b558271c8c/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f313230302f312a715f584c6e4a3268314c35795a6a4e6e534b7a6a35772e706e67)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/c141c7e91095463b29923cacde6f236181b993c8fd7d30f2494016b558271c8c/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f313230302f312a715f584c6e4a3268314c35795a6a4e6e534b7a6a35772e706e67)

**child-left: parent-right**

Note also that we're passing each ingredient as a 'thing' to the ChildComponent component.

This is how a parent component passes data to a child component. It doesn't need to be called 'thing'; you can call it whatever you want.

Conceptually though, **every piece of data that a parent component passes down to a child component is called a 'prop' in React lingo.**

Let's take a look now at the Child Component. It serves two purposes:

1.  to render the props data that it gets from a parent component,
2.  to add the ability for a user to click on it and have it toggle a strikethrough, indicating that the item is 'complete'.

The overall structure of the child component is nothing we haven't seen. It's just another class component with its own s**tate object and a method called** `handleClick`** .**

**A component accesses its props via the** `this.props` **object.**

*Any prop a parent component passes down to a child component is accessible inside the child component's* `this.prop` *object.*

So our child component keeps its own state that tracks whether the component has been clicked or not.

Then at the top of the `render` function, it uses a ternary condition to determine whether the div tag that is being rendered should have a strikethrough or not.

The `handleClick` method is then invoked via an `onClick` handler on the div tag; it does the work of toggling the `this.state.clicked` Boolean.

The overall structure of React applications can be represented as a hierarchical tree structure, just like how the DOM itself is structure. There is an overarching root component at the top of the hierarchy that every other component sits underneath. Specifying that a component should be a child of some parent component is as simple as throwing it in the parent component's render function, just like how we did it in this example

### **Core Concepts:**

#### 1\. What is react?

#### React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It uses components to update and render as your data changes.

> React manages the **creation and continuous updating of DOM nodes in your Web page**.

- *It does not handle* [_AJAX_](https://skillcrush.com/blog/what-is-ajax/) *requests, Local Storage or style your website. IT is just a tool to dynamically render content on a webpage as a result of changes in 'state'. Because it's function is so limited in scope you may hear it referred to as a library... (not a framework ... like Angular for example) and you may also hear it described as unopinionated.*

#### 2\. Why use react?

- Works for teams and helps UI workflow patterns
- The components can be reusable
- Componentized UI is the future of web dev

### Declarative programming

In the same way that you use HTML to *declare* what the user interface should\
look like, React provides the same mechanism in its `createElement` method or the higher-level language known as JSX.

[![React... like HTML is Declarative](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/c2efeda31081d4eeb1e5a15582d38c9656f24748b6c2ad51f98a216d6f740afe/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f3630302f302a4d572d413544705f76315430424231732e706e67)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/c2efeda31081d4eeb1e5a15582d38c9656f24748b6c2ad51f98a216d6f740afe/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f3630302f302a4d572d413544705f76315430424231732e706e67)

React... like HTML is Declarative[Declarative programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming) is often defined as any style of programming that is not [imperative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming "Imperative programming").

A number of other common definitions attempt to define it by simply contrasting it with imperative programming. For example:

- A high-level program that describes what a computation should perform.
- Any programming language that lacks [side effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect_%28computer_science%29 "Computation")
- A language with a clear correspondence to [mathematical logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_logic).[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming#cite_note-5)

These definitions overlap substantially.

D**eclarative programming is a non-imperative style of programming in which programs describe their desired results without explicitly listing commands or steps that must be performed.**

[Functional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming "Functional programming") and [logical programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_programming "Logical programming") languages are characterized by a declarative programming style.

*In a* [_pure functional language_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_functional_language "Pure functional language")*, such as* [_Haskell_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_%28programming_language%29)*, all functions are* [_without side effects_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function "Pure function")*, and state changes are only represented as functions that transform the state, which is explicitly represented as a* [_first-class_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_citizen "Mathematical logic") *object in the program.*

### What is a React pure component?

[Based on the concept of purity in functional programming paradigms, a function is said to be pure if:](https://blog.logrocket.com/react-pure-components-functional/#whatisareactpurecomponent)

- Its return value is only determined by its input values
- Its return value is always the same for the same input values

A React component is considered pure if it renders the same output for the same state and props. For class components like this, React provides the `PureComponent` base class. Class components that extend the `React.PureComponent` class are treated as pure components.

Pure components have some performance improvements and render optimizations since React implements the `shouldComponentUpdate()` method for them with a shallow comparison for props and state.

### Are React functional components pure?

Functional components are very useful in React, especially when you want to isolate state management from the component. That's why they are often called stateless components.

However, functional components cannot leverage the performance improvements and render optimizations that come with `React.PureComponent` since they are not classes by definition.

If you want React to treat a functional component as a pure component, you'll have to convert the functional component to a class component that extends `React.PureComponent`.

### Reusability

React encourages you to think in terms of reusability as you construct the user\
interface from elements and components that you create. When you\
make a list or a button, you can then reuse those components to show different data 'state' in the same UI structure as you have built for different data previously.

[![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/ace6a00ca55f6c6647c3ca5486d02412eb2bf3f55af0077aac5dd5e576989da6/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f3830302f302a63424c513561425032716968725435392e6a706567)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/ace6a00ca55f6c6647c3ca5486d02412eb2bf3f55af0077aac5dd5e576989da6/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f3830302f302a63424c513561425032716968725435392e6a706567)

#### Component-Based

Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs.

Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep state out of the DOM.

#### Learn Once, Write Anywhere

We don't make assumptions about the rest of your technology stack, so you can develop new features in React without rewriting existing code.

React can also render on the server using Node and power mobile apps using [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/).

### Speed

Due to the use of a virtual DOM, React handles changes to a Web page more\
intelligently than just string manipulation. It is constantly monitors the\
virtual DOM for changes. It very efficiently reconciles changes in the virtual\
DOM with what it has already produced in the real DOM. This is what\
makes React one of the speediest front-end libraries available.

#### 3. Who uses react?

- Companies such as Facebook app for android and Instagram
- [Here](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/showcase.html) is a link to a list of other companies who use react.

Who uses react#### 4. Setting up react

- React can be set up in CodePen for quick practice development by adding react.js, react-dom and babel.
- It can also be set up by downloading a react starter project from GitHub installing node and following these [instructions](https://github.com/hjb23/ReduxSimpleStarter).
- Alternatively it can be set up through NPM like [this](https://www.codementor.io/tamizhvendan/beginner-guide-setup-reactjs-environment-npm-babel-6-webpack-du107r9zr).

#### 5\. Intro to eco system

- Composition, being able to wrap up sections of code into there own containers so they can be re used.
- How to make a large application? by combining small components to create a larger complex application.

#### 6\. Imperative vs Declarative [(React is Declarative)](https://medium.com/trabe/why-is-react-declarative-a-story-about-function-components-aaae83198f79)

- **Imperative, 'telling to computer HOW to do something' e.g looping over an array of numbers using a for loop.**
- **Declarative, is concerned about WHAT we want to happen. e.g using a reduce method on an array.**
- Benefits of using declarative code:
- Reduce side effects
- Minimize mutability
- Less Bugs

#### 7\. Unidirectional Data Flow

- As the state collects from user interaction, the UI gets updated.

1.  Explicit Mutations
2.  Whenever the state needs to be updated in our application setState has to be called.

```
this.setState({
  highlight: !this.state.highlight,
})

```

#### 7.1. First component

- Components are the building blocks of React.
- They are similar to a collection of HTML,CSS, JS and data specific to that component.
- They can be defined in pure JavaScript or JSX.
- Data is either received from a component's parent component, or it's contained in the component itself.
- Applications can be separated into smaller components like this...
- React components can be created using ES6 class like this.

```
import React from 'react';

class Hello extends React.Component {
  render () {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}!</h1>;
  }
}

export default Hello;

```

- At the top with have the code to bring react and react dom libraries in.
- React library is used for the react syntax.
- React DOM is used to update the DOM.
- We then have the Class section which creates the component.
- Render() describes the specific UI for the component.
- Return is used to return the JSX
- And Finally ReactDOM.render is used to update the DOM.

#### 8\. Data flow with props

Small examples of data flow, see if you can get the code to work.

#### 9\. Creating lists with map

The parent component passes down to the child component as props.

Using props to access names and map to loop through each list item. Then passing this by using props.

Checking data to see if Boolean is true then adding detail to the list.

#### 10\. Prop types

PropTypes allow you to declare the type (string, number, function, etc) of each prop being passed to a component. Then if a prop passed in isn't of the declared type you'll get a warning in the console.

### Excerpt from the React website:

### React --- A JavaScript library for building user interfaces

> _A JavaScript library for building user interfaces_

#### Declarative

React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes.

Declarative views make your code more predictable and easier to debug.

#### A Simple Component

React components implement a `render()` method that takes input data and returns what to display. This example uses an XML-like syntax called JSX. Input data that is passed into the component can be accessed by `render()` via `this.props`.

JSX is optional and not required to use React. Try the [Babel REPL](https://babeljs.io/repl/#?presets=react&code_lz=MYewdgzgLgBApgGzgWzmWBeGAeAFgRgD4AJRBEAGhgHcQAnBAEwEJsB6AwgbgChRJY_KAEMAlmDh0YWRiGABXVOgB0AczhQAokiVQAQgE8AkowAUAcjogQUcwEpeAJTjDgUACIB5ALLK6aRklTRBQ0KCohMQk6Bx4gA) to see the raw JavaScript code produced by the JSX compilation step.

In addition to taking input data (accessed via `this.props`), a component can maintain internal state data (accessed via `this.state`). When a component's state data changes, the rendered markup will be updated by re-invoking `render()`.

#### An Application

Using `props` and `state`, we can put together a small Todo application. This example uses `state` to track the current list of items as well as the text that the user has entered. Although event handlers appear to be rendered inline, they will be collected and implemented using event delegation.

#### A Component Using External Plugins

React allows you to interface with other libraries and frameworks. This example uses remarkable, an external Markdown library, to convert the `<textarea>`'s value in real time.

### The Repository & Live Site Behind This Article:

### About Python(Taken From Tutorial Page Of Docs):

[Python enables programs to be written compactly and readably. Programs written in Python are typically much shorter than equivalent C, C++, or Java programs, for several reasons:](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/appetite.html)

- the high-level data types allow you to express complex operations in a single statement;
- statement grouping is done by indentation instead of beginning and ending brackets;
- no variable or argument declarations are necessary.

### Installing Python:

### Windows

To determine if your Windows computer already has Python 3:

1.  Open a command prompt by entering command prompt in the Windows 10 search box and selecting the Command Prompt App in the Best match section of the results.
2.  Enter the following command and then select the Enter key:
3.  ConsoleCopy

`python --version`

1\. Running `python --version` may not return a value, or may return an error message stating _'python' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file._ This indicates Python is not installed on your Windows system. 2. If you see the word `Python` with a set of numbers separated by `.` characters, some version of Python is installed.

#### i.e.

> `Python 3.8.0`

**As long as the first number is** `3`, you have Python 3 installed.

### Python

- Python is an interpreted, high-level and general-purpose, dynamically typed programming language
- It is also Object oriented, modular oriented and a scripting language.
- In Python, everything is considered as an Object.
- A python file has an extension of .py
- Python follows Indentation to separate code blocks instead of flower brackets({}).
- We can run a python file by the following command in cmd(Windows) or shell(mac/linux).
- `python <filename.py>`

#### By default, the python doesn't require any imports to run a python file.

### Create and execute a program

1.  Open up a terminal/cmd
2.  Create the program: nano/cat > [nameProgram.py](http://nameprogram.py/)
3.  Write the program and save it
4.  python [nameProgram.py](http://nameprogram.py/)

### Basic Data Structures

### List

- List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.
- Lists are created using square brackets:

```
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

```

- List items are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values.
- List items are indexed, the first item has index `[0]`, the second item has index `[1]` etc.
- The list is changeable, meaning that we can change, add, and remove items in a list after it has been created.
- To determine how many items a list has, use the `len()` function.
- A list can contain different data types:

```
list1 = ["abc", 34, True, 40, "male"]

```

- It is also possible to use the list() constructor when creating a new list

```
thislist = list(("apple", "banana", "cherry"))  # note the double round-brackets

```

### Tuple

- Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
- A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable.
- Tuples are written with round brackets.

```
thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")

```

- Tuple items are ordered, unchangeable, and allow duplicate values.
- Tuple items are indexed, the first item has index `[0]`, the second item has index `[1]` etc.
- When we say that tuples are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.
- Tuples are unchangeable, meaning that we cannot change, add or remove items after the tuple has been created.
- Since tuple are indexed, tuples can have items with the same value:
- Tuples allow duplicate values:

```
thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple", "cherry")

```

- To determine how many items a tuple has, use the `len()`function:

```
thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
print(len(thistuple))

```

- To create a tuple with only one item, you have to add a comma after the item, otherwise Python will not recognize it as a tuple.

```
thistuple = ("apple",)
print(type(thistuple))

#NOT a tuple
thistuple = ("apple")
print(type(thistuple))

```

- It is also possible to use the tuple() constructor to make a tuple.

```
thistuple = tuple(("apple", "banana", "cherry")) # note the double round-brackets
print(thistuple)

```

### Set

- Set is a collection which is unordered and unindexed. No duplicate members.
- A set is a collection which is both unordered and unindexed.

```
thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}

```

- Set items are unordered, unchangeable, and do not allow duplicate values.
- Unordered means that the items in a set do not have a defined order.
- Set items can appear in a different order every time you use them, and cannot be referred to by index or key.
- Sets are unchangeable, meaning that we cannot change the items after the set has been created.
- Duplicate values will be ignored.
- To determine how many items a set has, use the `len()` method.

```
thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}

print(len(thisset))

```

- Set items can be of any data type:

```
set1 = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
set2 = {1, 5, 7, 9, 3}
set3 = {True, False, False}
set4 = {"abc", 34, True, 40, "male"}

```

- It is also possible to use the `set()` constructor to make a set.

```
thisset = set(("apple", "banana", "cherry")) # note the double round-brackets

```

### Dictionary

- Dictionary is a collection which is unordered and changeable. No duplicate members.
- Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs.
- Dictionaries are written with curly brackets, and have keys and values:

```
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}

```

- Dictionary items are presented in key:value pairs, and can be referred to by using the key name.

```
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
print(thisdict["brand"])

```

- Dictionaries are changeable, meaning that we can change, add or remove items after the dictionary has been created.
- Dictionaries cannot have two items with the same key.
- Duplicate values will overwrite existing values.
- To determine how many items a dictionary has, use the `len()` function.

```
print(len(thisdict))

```

- The values in dictionary items can be of any data type

```
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "electric": False,
  "year": 1964,
  "colors": ["red", "white", "blue"]
}

```

### Conditional branching

```
if condition:
        pass
    elif condition2:
        pass
    else:
        pass

```

### Loops

Python has two primitive loop commands:

1.  while loops
2.  for loops

#### While loop

- With the `while` loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.
- Example: Print i as long as i is less than 6

```
i = 1
while i < 6:
  print(i)
  i += 1

```

- The while loop requires relevant variables to be ready, in this example we need to define an indexing variable, i, which we set to 1.
- With the `break` statement we can stop the loop even if the while condition is true
- With the continue statement we can stop the current iteration, and continue with the next.
- With the else statement we can run a block of code once when the condition no longer is true.

#### For loop

- A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).
- This is less like the for keyword in other programming languages, and works more like an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming languages.
- With the for loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc.

```
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
  print(x)

```

- The for loop does not require an indexing variable to set beforehand.
- To loop through a set of code a specified number of times, we can use the range() function.
- The range() function returns a sequence of numbers, starting from 0 by default, and increments by 1 (by default), and ends at a specified number.
- The range() function defaults to increment the sequence by 1, however it is possible to specify the increment value by adding a third parameter: range(2, 30, 3).
- The else keyword in a for loop specifies a block of code to be executed when the loop is finished.\
  A nested loop is a loop inside a loop.
- The "inner loop" will be executed one time for each iteration of the "outer loop":

```
adj = ["red", "big", "tasty"]
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

for x in adj:
  for y in fruits:
    print(x, y)

```

- for loops cannot be empty, but if you for some reason have a for loop with no content, put in the pass statement to avoid getting an error.

```
for x in [0, 1, 2]:
  pass

```

### Function definition

```
def function_name():
    return

```

### Function call

```
function_name()

```

- We need not to specify the return type of the function.
- Functions by default return `None`
- We can return any datatype.

---

### Python Syntax

Python syntax was made for readability, and easy editing. For example, the python language uses a `:` and indented code, while javascript and others generally use `{}` and indented code.

### First Program

Lets create a [python 3](https://repl.it/languages/python3) repl, and call it *Hello World*. Now you have a blank file called *main.py*. Now let us write our first line of code:

```
print('Hello world!')

```

> _Brian Kernighan actually wrote the first "Hello, World!" program as part of the documentation for the BCPL programming language developed by Martin Richards._

Now, press the run button, which obviously runs the code. If you are not using replit, this will not work. You should research how to run a file with your text editor.

### Command Line

If you look to your left at the console where hello world was just printed, you can see a `>`, `>>>`, or `$` depending on what you are using. After the prompt, try typing a line of code.

```
Python 3.6.1 (default, Jun 21 2017, 18:48:35)
[GCC 4.9.2] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
> print('Testing command line')
Testing command line
> print('Are you sure this works?')
Are you sure this works?
>

```

The command line allows you to execute single lines of code at a time. It is often used when trying out a new function or method in the language.

### New: Comments!

Another cool thing that you can generally do with all languages, are comments. In python, a comment starts with a `#`. The computer ignores all text starting after the `#`.

`# Write some comments!`

If you have a huge comment, do **not** comment all the 350 lines, just put `'''` before it, and `'''` at the end. Technically, this is not a comment but a string, but the computer still ignores it, so we will use it.

### New: Variables!

Unlike many other languages, there is no `var`, `let`, or `const` to declare a variable in python. You simply go `name = 'value'`.

Remember, there is a difference between integers and strings. *Remember: String =* `""`*.* To convert between these two, you can put an int in a `str()` function, and a string in a `int()` function. There is also a less used one, called a float. Mainly, these are integers with decimals. Change them using the `float()` command.

[](https://repl.it/@bgoonz/second-scr?lite=true&referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fbryanguner.medium.com)<https://repl.it/@bgoonz/second-scr?lite=true&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fbryanguner.medium.com>

```
x = 5
x = str(x)
b = '5'
b = int(b)
print('x = ', x, '; b = ', str(b), ';') # => x = 5; b = 5;

```

Instead of using the `,` in the print function, you can put a `+` to combine the variables and string.

### Operators

There are many operators in python:

- `+`
- `-`
- `/`
- `*`\
  These operators are the same in most languages, and allow for addition, subtraction, division, and multiplicaiton.\
  Now, we can look at a few more complicated ones:

[![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/12367f978d6008632ed72f277e602ee53cac5e4c001c13420971a0ef648e0c7f/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f3830302f302a6f564944785764674a586f49743743492e6a7067)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/12367f978d6008632ed72f277e602ee53cac5e4c001c13420971a0ef648e0c7f/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f3830302f302a6f564944785764674a586f49743743492e6a7067)

_simpleops.py_

```
x = 4
a = x + 1
a = x - 1
a = x * 2
a = x / 2

```

You should already know everything shown above, as it is similar to other languages. If you continue down, you will see more complicated ones.

_complexop.py_

```
a += 1
a -= 1
a *= 2
a /= 2

```

The ones above are to edit the current value of the variable.\
Sorry to JS users, as there is no `i++;` or anything.

### _Fun Fact: The python language was named after Monty Python._

If you really want to know about the others, view [Py Operators](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_basic_operators.htm)

### More Things With Strings

Like the title?\
Anyways, a `'` and a `"` both indicate a string, but **do not combine them!**

_quotes.py_

```
x = 'hello' # Good
x = "hello" # Good
x = "hello' # ERRORRR!!!

```

_slicing.py_

### String Slicing

You can look at only certain parts of the string by slicing it, using `[num:num]`.\
The first number stands for how far in you go from the front, and the second stands for how far in you go from the back.

```
x = 'Hello everybody!'
x[1] # 'e'
x[-1] # '!'
x[5] # ' '
x[1:] # 'ello everybody!'
x[:-1] # 'Hello everybod'
x[2:-3] # 'llo everyb'

```

### Methods and Functions

Here is a list of functions/methods we will go over:

- `.strip()`
- `len()`
- `.lower()`
- `.upper()`
- `.replace()`

### New: Input()

Input is a function that gathers input entered from the user in the command line. It takes one optional parameter, which is the users prompt.

_inp.py_

```
print('Type something: ')
x = input()
print('Here is what you said: ', x)

```

If you wanted to make it smaller, and look neater to the user, you could do...

_inp2.py_

```
print('Here is what you said: ', input('Type something: '))

```

Running:\
_inp.py_

```
Type something:
Hello World
Here is what you said: Hello World

```

_inp2.py_

```
Type something: Hello World
Here is what you said: Hello World

```

### New: Importing Modules

Python has created a lot of functions that are located in other .py files. You need to import these **modules** to gain access to the,, You may wonder why python did this. The purpose of separate modules is to make python faster. Instead of storing millions and millions of functions, , it only needs a few basic ones. To import a module, you must write `input <modulename>`. Do not add the .py extension to the file name. In this example , we will be using a python created module named random.

_module.py_

```
import random

```

Now, I have access to all functions in the random.py file. To access a specific function in the module, you would do `<module>.<function>`. For example:

_module2.py_

```
import random
print(random.randint(3,5)) # Prints a random number between 3 and 5

```

> *Pro Tip:\
> Do* `from random import randint` *to not have to do* `random.randint()`*, just* `randint()`*\
> To import all functions from a module, you could do* `from random import *`

### New: Loops!

Loops allow you to repeat code over and over again. This is useful if you want to print Hi with a delay of one second 100 times.

#### `for` Loop

The for loop goes through a list of variables, making a seperate variable equal one of the list every time.\
Let's say we wanted to create the example above.

_loop.py_

```
from time import sleep
for i in range(100):
     print('Hello')
     sleep(.3)

```

This will print Hello with a .3 second delay 100 times. This is just one way to use it, but it is usually used like this:

_loop2.py_

```
import time
for number in range(100):
     print(number)
     time.sleep(.1)

```

[](https://storage.googleapis.com/replit/images/1539649280875_37d22e6d49e8e8fbc453631def345387.pn)<https://storage.googleapis.com/replit/images/1539649280875_37d22e6d49e8e8fbc453631def345387.pn>

#### `while` Loop

The while loop runs the code while something stays true. You would put `while <expression>`. Every time the loop runs, it evaluates if the expression is True. It it is, it runs the code, if not it continues outside of the loop. For example:

_while.py_

```
while True: # Runs forever
     print('Hello World!')

```

Or you could do:

_while2.py_

```
import random
position = '<placeholder>'
while position != 1: # will run at least once
    position = random.randint(1, 10)
    print(position)

```

### New: `if` Statement

The if statement allows you to check if something is True. If so, it runs the code, if not, it continues on. It is kind of like a while loop, but it executes **only once**. An if statement is written:

_if.py_

```
import random
num = random.randint(1, 10)
if num == 3:
     print('num is 3. Hooray!!!')
if num > 5:
     print('Num is greater than 5')
if num == 12:
     print('Num is 12, which means that there is a problem with the python language, see if you can figure it out. Extra credit if you can figure it out!')

```

Now, you may think that it would be better if you could make it print only one message. Not as many that are True. You can do that with an `elif` statement:

_elif.py_

```
import random
num = random.randint(1, 10)
if num == 3:
    print('Num is three, this is the only msg you will see.')
elif num > 2:
    print('Num is not three, but is greater than 1')

```

Now, you may wonder how to run code if none work. Well, there is a simple statement called `else:`

_else.py_

```
import random
num = random.randint(1, 10)
if num == 3:
    print('Num is three, this is the only msg you will see.')
elif num > 2:
    print('Num is not three, but is greater than 1')
else:
    print('No category')

```

### New: Functions (`def`)

So far, you have only seen how to use functions other people have made. Let use the example that you want to print the a random number between 1 and 9, and print different text every time.\
It is quite tiring to type:

Characters: 389

_nofunc.py_

```
import random
print(random.randint(1, 9))
print('Wow that was interesting.')
print(random.randint(1, 9))
print('Look at the number above ^')
print(random.randint(1, 9))
print('All of these have been interesting numbers.')
print(random.randint(1, 9))
print("these random.randint's are getting annoying to type")
print(random.randint(1, 9))
print('Hi')
print(random.randint(1, 9))
print('j')

```

Now with functions, you can seriously lower the amount of characters:

Characters: 254

_functions.py_

```
import random
def r(t):
     print(random.randint(1, 9))
     print(t)
r('Wow that was interesting.')
r('Look at the number above ^')
r('All of these have been interesting numbers.')
r("these random.randint's are getting annoying to type")
r('Hi')
r('j')

```

### Project Based Learning:

The following is a modified version of a tutorial posted By: [InvisibleOne](https://replit.com/@InvisibleOne)

I would cite the original tutorial it's self but at the time of this writing I can no longer find it on his repl.it profile and so the only reference I have are my own notes from following the tutorial when I first found it.

### 1\. Adventure Story

The first thing you need with an adventure story is a great storyline, something that is exciting and fun. The idea is, that at each pivotal point in the story, you give the player the opportunity to make a choice.\
First things first, let's import the stuff that we need, like this:

```
import os   #very useful for clearing the screen
import random

```

Now, we need some variables to hold some of the player data.

```
name = input("Name Please:  ") #We'll use this to get the name from the user
nickname = input("Nickname: ")

```

Ok, now we have the player's name and nickname, let's welcome them to the game

```
print("Hello and welcome " + name)

```

Now for the story. The most important part of all stories is the introduction, so let's print our introduction

```
print("Long ago, there was a magical meal known as Summuh and Spich Atip") #We can drop a line by making a new print statement, or we can use the escape code \n
print("It was said that this meal had the power to save lives, restore peace, and stop evil\nBecuase it was so powerful, it was hidden away on a mountain that could not be climbed\nBut it's power brought unwanted attention, and a great war broke out.\nFinally, the leaders of the good side chose a single hero to go and find the Summah and Spich Atip, that hero was " + name + "\n so " + nickname + ' headed out to find this great power, and stop the war...')

```

Now, we'll give the player their first choice

```
print("After hiking through the wastelands for a long time, you come to a massive ravine, there is only a single way across\nA rickety old bridge, taking that could be very dangerous, but... maybe you could jump across?")
choice1 = input("[1]  Take the bridge     [2] Try and jump over")
#Now we check to see what the player chose
If choice1 == '1':
  print("You slowly walk across the bride, it creakes ominously, then suddenly breaks! You flail through the air before hitting the ground a thousand feet below. Judging by the fact that you hit the ground with the equivalent force of being hit by a cement truck moving at 125 miles an hour, you are dead...")
  #The player lost, so now we'll boot them out of the program with the exit command
  exit()
#Then we check to see if they made the other choice, we can do with with else if, written as elif
elif choice1 == '2':
  print("You make the jump! You see a feather hit the bridge, the weight breakes it and sends it to the bottom of the ravine\nGood thing you didn't use that bridge.")
#Now we can continue the story
print("A few more hours of travel and you come to the unclimbable mountain.")
choice2 == input("[1]   Give up    [2]    Try and climb the mountain")
if choice2 == '1':
  print("You gave up and lost...")
  #now we exit them again
  exit()
elif choice2 == '1':
  print("you continue up the mountain. Climbing is hard, but finally you reach the top.\nTo your surprise there is a man standing at the top of the mountain, he is very old.")
  print("Old Man: Hey " + nickname)
  print("You: How do you know my name!?!")
  print("Old Man: Because you have a name tag on...")
  print("You: Oh, well, were is the Summuh and Spich Atip?")
  print("Old Man: Summuh and Spich Atip? You must mean the Pita Chips and Hummus")
  print("You: Pita...chips...humus, what power do those have?")
  print("Old Man: Pretty simple kid, their organic...")
  #Now let's clear the screen
  os.system('clear')
  print("YOU WON!!!")

```

There you have it, a pretty simple choose your own ending story. You can make it as complex or uncomplex as you like.

### 2\. TEXT ENCODER

Ever make secret messages as a kid? I used to. Anyways, here's the way you can make a program to encode messages! It's pretty simple. First things first, let's get the message the user wants to encode, we'll use input() for that:

```
message = input("Message you would like encoded: ")

```

Now we need to split that string into a list of characters, this part is a bit more complicated.

```
#We'll make a function, so we can use it later
def split(x):
  return (char for char in x)
#now we'll call this function with our text
L_message = message.lower() #This way we can lower any of their input
encode = split(l_message)

```

Now we need to convert the characters into code, well do this with a for loop:

```
out = []
for x in encode:
  if x == 'a':
    out.append('1')
  elif x == 'b':
    out.append('2')
#And we'll continue on though this with each letter of the alphabet

```

Once we've encoded the text, we'll print it back for the user

```
x = ' '.join(out)
#this will turn out into a string that we can print
print(x)

```

And if you want to decode something, it is this same process but in reverse!

### 3\. Guess my Number

Number guessing games are fun and pretty simple, all you need are a few loops. To start, we need to import random.

```
import random

```

That is pretty simple. Now we'll make a list with the numbers were want available for the game

```
num_list = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

```

Next, we get a random number from the list

```
num = random.choice(num_list)

```

Now, we need to ask the user for input, we'll to this with a while loop

```
while True:
  # We could use guess = input("What do you think my number is?   "), but that would produce a string, and numbers are integers, so we'll convert the input into an integer
  guess = int(input("What do you think my number is?   "))
  #Next, we'll check if that number is equal to the number we picked
  if guess == num:
    break   #this will remove us from the loop, so we can display the win message
  else:
    print("Nope, that isn't it")
#outside our loop, we'll have the win message that is displayed if the player gets the correct number.
print("You won!")

```

Have fun with this!

### 4\. Notes

Here is a more advanced project, but still pretty easy. This will be using a txt file to save some notes. The first thing we need to do is to create a txt file in your repl, name it 'notes.txt'\
Now, to open a file in python we use open('filename', type) The type can be 'r' for read, or 'w' for write. There is another option, but we won't be using that here. Now, the first thing we are going to do is get what the user would like to save:

```
message = input("What would you like to save?")

```

Now we'll open our file and save that text

```
o = open('notes.txt', 'w')
o.write(message)
#this next part is very important, you need to always remember to close your file or what you wrote to it won't be saved
o.close()

```

There we go, now the information is in the file. Next, we'll retrieve it

```
read = open('notes.txt', 'r')
out = read.read()
# now we need to close the file
read.close()
# and now print what we read
print(out)

```

There we go, that's how you can open files and close files with python

### 5\. Random Dare Generator

Who doesn't love a good dare? Here is a program that can generate random dares. The first thing we'll need to do is as always, import random. Then we'll make some lists of dares

```
import random
list1 = ['jump on', 'sit on', 'rick roll on', 'stop on', 'swing on']
list2 = ['your cat', 'your neighbor', 'a dog', 'a tree', 'a house']
list3 = ['your mom', 'your best friend', 'your dad', 'your teacher']
#now we'll generate a dare
while True:
  if input() == '': #this will trigger if they hit enter
    print("I dare you to " + random.choice(list1) + ' ' + random.choice(list2) + ' in front of '  + random.choice(list3)

```

#### Q1. In the following example, which selector has the highest specificity ranking for selecting the anchor link element?

```
ul li a
a
.example a
div a

```

- [x] `.example a`
- [ ] `div a`
- [ ] `a`
- [ ] `ul li a`

#### Q2. Using an attribute selector, how would you select an `<a>` element with a "title" attribute?

- [x] a[title]{...}
- [ ] a > title {...}
- [ ] a.title {...}
- [ ] a=title {...}

#### Q3. CSS grid and flexbox are now becoming a more popular way to create page layouts. However, floats are still commonly used, especially when working with an older code base, or it you need to support older browser version. What are two valid techniques used to clear floats?

- [ ] Use the "clearfix hack" on the floated element and add a float to the parent element.
- [ ] Use the overflow property on the floated element or the "clearfix hack" on either the floated or parent element.
- [ ] Use the "clearfix hack" on the floated element or the overflow property on the parent element.
- [x] Use the "clearfix hack" on the parent element or use the overflow property with a value other than "visible."

#### Q4. What element(s) do the following selectors match to?

`1) .nav {...}` `2) nav {...}` `3) #nav {...}`

- [ ]

```
1\. An element with an ID of "nav"
2. A nav element
3. An element with a class of "nav"

```

- [ ]

```
They all target the same nav element.

```

- [x]

```
1\. An element with an class of "nav"
2. A nav element
3. An element with a id of "nav"

```

- [ ]

```
1\. An element with an class of "nav"
2. A nav element
3. An div with a id of "nav"

```

#### Q5. When adding transparency styles, what is the difference between using the opacity property versus the background property with an `rgba()` value?

- [ ] Opacity specifies the level of transparency of the child elements. Background with an `rgba()` value applies transparency to the background color only.
- [ ] Opacity applies transparency to the background color only. Background with an `rgba()` value specifies the level of transparency of an element, as a whole, including its content.
- [x] Opacity specifies the level of transparency of an element, including its content. Background with an `rgba()` value applies transparency to the background color only.
- [ ] Opacity applies transparency to the parent and child elements. Background with an `rgba()` value specifies the level of transparency of the parent element only.

#### Q6. What is true of block and inline elements? (Alternative: Which statement about block and inline elements is true?)

- [ ] By default, block elements are the same height and width as the content container between their tags; inline elements span the entire width of its container.
- [x] By default, block elements span the entire width of its container; inline elements are the same height and width as the content contained between their tags.
- [ ] A `<nav>` element is an example of an inline element. `<header>` is an example of a block element.
- [ ] A `<span>` is an example of a block element. `<div>` is an example of an inline element.

#### Q7. CSS grid introduced a new length unit, fr, to create flexible grid tracks. Referring to the code sample below, what will the widths of the three columns be?

```
.grid {
  display: grid;
  width: 500px;
  grid-template-columns: 50px 1fr 2fr;
}

```

- [ ] The first column will have a width of 50px. The second column will be 50px wide and the third column will be 100px wide.
- [x] The first column will have a width of 50px. The second column will be 150px wide and the third column will be 300px wide.
- [ ] The first column will have a width of 50px. The second column will be 300px wide and the third column will be 150px wide.
- [ ] The first column will have a width of 50px. The second column will be 500px wide and the third column will be 1000px wide.

#### Q8. What is the line-height property primarily used for?

- [x] to control the height of the space between two lines of content
- [ ] to control the height of the space between heading elements
- [ ] to control the height of the character size
- [ ] to control the width of the space between characters

#### Q9. Three of these choices are true about class selectors. Which is NOT true?

- [ ] Multiple classes can be used within the same element.
- [ ] The same class can be used multiple times per page.
- [ ] Class selectors with a leading period
- [x] Classes can be used multiple times per page but not within the same element.

#### Q10. There are many properties that can be used to align elements and create page layouts such as float, position, flexbox and grid. Of these four properties, which one should be used to align a global navigation bar which stays fixed at the top of the page?

- [x] position
- [ ] flexbox
- [ ] grid
- [ ] float

#### Q11. In the shorthand example below, which individual background properties are represented?

`background: blue url(image.jpg) no-repeat scroll 0px 0px;`

- [x]

```
background-color: blue;
background-image: url(image.jpg);
background-repeat: no-repeat;
background-attachment: scroll;
background-position: 0px 0px;

```

- [ ]

```
background-color: blue;
background-img: url(image.jpg);
background-position: no-repeat;
background-scroll: scroll;
background-size: 0px 0px;

```

- [ ]

```
background-color: blue;
background-src: url(image.jpg);
background-repeat: no-repeat;
background-wrap: scroll;
background-position: 0px 0px;

```

- [ ]

```
background-color: blue;
background-src: url(image.jpg);
background-repeat: no-repeat;
background-scroll: scroll;
background-position: 0px 0px;

```

#### Q12. In the following example, according to cascading and specificity rules, what color will the link be?

```
.example {
  color: yellow;
}
ul li a {
  color: blue;
}
ul a {
  color: green;
}
a {
  color: red;
}

<ul>
  <li><a href="#" class="example">link</a></li>
  <li>list item</li>
  <li>list item</li>
</ul>

```

- [ ] green
- [x] yellow
- [ ] blue

# Data Structures... Under The Hood

Data Structures Reference

---

### Data Structures... Under The Hood

### Data Structures Reference

---

### Array

Stores things in order. Has quick lookups by index.

### Linked List

Also stores things in order. Faster insertions and deletions than\
arrays, but slower lookups (you have to "walk down" the whole list).

!

### Queue

Like the line outside a busy restaurant. "First come, first served."

### Stack

Like a stack of dirty plates in the sink. The first one you take off the\
top is the last one you put down.

### Tree

Good for storing hierarchies. Each node can have "child" nodes.

### Binary Search Tree

Everything in the left subtree is smaller than the current node,\
everything in the right subtree is larger. lookups, but only if the tree\
is balanced!

### Binary Search Tree

### Graph

Good for storing networks, geography, social relationships, etc.

### Heap

A binary tree where the smallest value is always at the top. Use it to implement a priority queue.

![A binary heap is a binary tree where the nodes are organized to so that the smallest value is always at the top.]

### Adjacency list

A list where the index represents the node and the value at that index is a list of the node's neighbors:

graph = [ [1], [0, 2, 3], [1, 3], [1, 2], ]

Since node 3 has edges to nodes 1 and 2, graph[3] has the adjacency list [1, 2].

We could also use [a dictionary](https://www.interviewcake.com/concept/hash-map) where the keys represent the node and the values are the lists of neighbors.

graph = { 0: [1], 1: [0, 2, 3], 2: [1, 3], 3: [1, 2], }

This would be useful if the nodes were represented by strings, objects, or otherwise didn't map cleanly to list indices.

### Adjacency matrix

A matrix of 0s and 1s indicating whether node x connects to node y (0 means no, 1 means yes).

graph = [ [0, 1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1], [0, 1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 1, 0], ]

Since node 3 has edges to nodes 1 and 2, graph[3][1] and graph[3][2] have value 1.

a = LinkedListNode(5) b = LinkedListNode(1) c = LinkedListNode(9) a.next = b b.next = c

---

### Arrays

Ok, so we know how to store individual numbers. Let's talk about storing *several numbers*.

That's right, things are starting to *heat up*.

Suppose we wanted to keep a count of how many bottles of kombucha we drink every day.

Let's store each day's kombucha count in an 8-bit, fixed-width, unsigned integer. That should be plenty --- we're not likely to get through more than 256 (2⁸) bottles in a *single day*, right?

And let's store the kombucha counts right next to each other in RAM, starting at memory address 0:

Bam. That's an **array**. RAM is _basically_ an array already.

Just like with RAM, the elements of an array are numbered. We call that number the **index** of the array element (plural: indices). In *this* example, each array element's index is the same as its address in RAM.

But that's not usually true. Suppose another program like Spotify had already stored some information at memory address 2:

We'd have to start our array below it, for example at memory address 3. So index 0 in our array would be at memory address 3, and index 1 would be at memory address 4, etc.:

Suppose we wanted to get the kombucha count at index 4 in our array. How do we figure out what _address in memory_ to go to? Simple math:

Take the array's starting address (3), add the index we're looking for (4), and that's the address of the item we're looking for. 3 + 4 = 7. In general, for getting the nth item in our array:

\text{address of nth item in array} = \text{address of array start} + n

This works out nicely because the size of the addressed memory slots and the size of each kombucha count are *both* 1 byte. So a slot in our array corresponds to a slot in RAM.

But that's not always the case. In fact, it's *usually not* the case. We *usually* use *64-bit* integers.

So how do we build an array of *64-bit* (8 byte) integers on top of our *8-bit* (1 byte) memory slots?

We simply give each array index *8* address slots instead of 1:

So we can still use simple math to grab the start of the nth item in our array --- just gotta throw in some multiplication:

\text{address of nth item in array} = \text{address of array start} + (n \* \text{size of each item in bytes})

Don't worry --- adding this multiplication doesn't really slow us down. Remember: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of fixed-width integers takes time. So *all* the math we're using here to get the address of the nth item in the array takes time.

And remember how we said the memory controller has a *direct connection* to each slot in RAM? That means we can read the stuff at any given memory address in time.

[![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/81bee4739753ed74dc96239d5a6c37745129da9f912b17ea085f8dc5f735899a/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f3830302f302a6b71765f4d386143485a576a52763930)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/81bee4739753ed74dc96239d5a6c37745129da9f912b17ea085f8dc5f735899a/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f3830302f302a6b71765f4d386143485a576a52763930)

**Together, this means looking up the contents of a given array index is time.** This fast lookup capability is the most important property of arrays.

But the formula we used to get the address of the nth item in our array only works *if*:

1.  **Each item in the array is the *same size*** (takes up the same

number of bytes).

1.  **The array is *uninterrupted* (contiguous) in memory**. There can't

be any gaps in the array...like to "skip over" a memory slot Spotify was already using.

These things make our formula for finding the nth item *work* because they make our array *predictable*. We can *predict* exactly where in memory the nth element of our array will be.

But they also constrain what kinds of things we can put in an array. Every item has to be the same size. And if our array is going to store a *lot* of stuff, we'll need a *bunch* of uninterrupted free space in RAM. Which gets hard when most of our RAM is already occupied by other programs (like Spotify).

That's the tradeoff. Arrays have fast lookups ( time), but each item in the array needs to be the same size, and you need a big block of uninterrupted free memory to store the array.

## Pointers

Remember how we said every item in an array had to be the same size? Let's dig into that a little more.

Suppose we wanted to store a bunch of ideas for baby names. Because we've got some *really* cute ones.

Each name is a string. Which is really an array. And now we want to store *those arrays* in an array. *Whoa*.

Now, what if our baby names have different lengths? That'd violate our rule that all the items in an array need to be the same size!

We could put our baby names in arbitrarily large arrays (say, 13 characters each), and just use a special character to mark the end of the string within each array...

[![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/a93f695da5594e01577afe4901b402f8ee90b12936002c234fe73ffd93fd81c9/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f3830302f302a44616e666f494a396e4e614f4b6e2d47)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/a93f695da5594e01577afe4901b402f8ee90b12936002c234fe73ffd93fd81c9/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f3830302f302a44616e666f494a396e4e614f4b6e2d47)

"Wigglesworth" is a cute baby name, right?

But look at all that wasted space after "Bill". And what if we wanted to store a string that was *more* than 13 characters? We'd be out of luck.

There's a better way. Instead of storing the strings right inside our array, let's just put the strings wherever we can fit them in memory. Then we'll have each element in our array hold the *address in memory* of its corresponding string. Each address is an integer, so really our outer array is just an array of integers. We can call each of these integers a **pointer**, since it points to another spot in memory.

[![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/23801d72722d915613791304a449dbd0dcf0aa8823450aa33d70d6002897a0db/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f3830302f302a614c4a347044723475415855315f5173)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/23801d72722d915613791304a449dbd0dcf0aa8823450aa33d70d6002897a0db/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f3830302f302a614c4a347044723475415855315f5173)

The pointers are marked with a \* at the beginning.

Pretty clever, right? This fixes *both* the disadvantages of arrays:

1.  The items don't have to be the same length --- each string can be as

long or as short as we want.

1.  We don't need enough uninterrupted free memory to store all our

strings next to each other --- we can place each of them separately, wherever there's space in RAM.

We fixed it! No more tradeoffs. Right?

Nope. Now we have a *new* tradeoff:

Remember how the memory controller sends the contents of *nearby* memory addresses to the processor with each read? And the processor caches them? So reading sequential addresses in RAM is *faster* because we can get most of those reads right from the cache?

[![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/ef75c69a9d45eed8ca9a4079e3b4d08e9f31057d3aec8b560078e7912e8001b3/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f3830302f302a556b576534593068384f376d7a30455f)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/ef75c69a9d45eed8ca9a4079e3b4d08e9f31057d3aec8b560078e7912e8001b3/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f3830302f302a556b576534593068384f376d7a30455f)

Our original array was very **cache-friendly**, because everything was sequential. So reading from the 0th index, then the 1st index, then the 2nd, etc. got an extra speedup from the processor cache.

**But the pointers in this array make it *not* cache-friendly**, because the baby names are scattered randomly around RAM. So reading from the 0th index, then the 1st index, etc. doesn't get that extra speedup from the cache.

That's the tradeoff. This pointer-based array requires less uninterrupted memory and can accommodate elements that aren't all the same size, *but* it's *slower* because it's not cache-friendly.

This slowdown isn't reflected in the big O time cost. Lookups in this pointer-based array are *still* time.

### Linked lists

Our word processor is definitely going to need fast appends --- appending to the document is like the *main thing* you do with a word processor.

Can we build a data structure that can store a string, has fast appends, *and* doesn't require you to say how long the string will be ahead of time?

Let's focus first on not having to know the length of our string ahead of time. Remember how we used *pointers* to get around length issues with our array of baby names?

What if we pushed that idea even further?

What if each *character* in our string were a *two-index array* with:

1.  the character itself 2. a pointer to the next character

We would call each of these two-item arrays a **node** and we'd call this series of nodes a **linked list**.

Here's how we'd actually implement it in memory:

[![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/fa90537e2be3dfa23b63efbd0a60c90e6255cf8b41f1aeee2b443982ea863964/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f3830302f302a304b5a6c39684e4e5f49465031355248)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/fa90537e2be3dfa23b63efbd0a60c90e6255cf8b41f1aeee2b443982ea863964/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f3830302f302a304b5a6c39684e4e5f49465031355248)

Notice how we're free to store our nodes wherever we can find two open slots in memory. They don't have to be next to each other. They don't even have to be _in order_:

[![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/180f34f807d7726c7917f4e798570eba0d7a815cc3e24a27e39926b3826e7fb4/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f3830302f302a6c534f417846754d415332784b334a49)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/180f34f807d7726c7917f4e798570eba0d7a815cc3e24a27e39926b3826e7fb4/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f3830302f302a6c534f417846754d415332784b334a49)

"But that's not cache-friendly, " you may be thinking. Good point! We'll get to that.

The first node of a linked list is called the **head**, and the last node is usually called the **tail**.

Confusingly, some people prefer to use "tail" to refer to *everything after the head* of a linked list. In an interview it's fine to use either definition. Briefly say which definition you're using, just to be clear.

It's important to have a pointer variable referencing the head of the list --- otherwise we'd be unable to find our way back to the start of the list!

We'll also sometimes keep a pointer to the tail. That comes in handy when we want to add something new to the end of the linked list. In fact, let's try that out:

Suppose we had the string "LOG" stored in a linked list:

[![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/053cfe655edadd7913d5fd62887a036d863232a4089a8e03ea580edadd825ce2/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f3830302f302a63332d3755684a3339505a6f6873757a)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/053cfe655edadd7913d5fd62887a036d863232a4089a8e03ea580edadd825ce2/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f3830302f302a63332d3755684a3339505a6f6873757a)

Suppose we wanted to add an "S" to the end, to make it "LOGS". How would we do that?

Easy. We just put it in a new node:

And tweak some pointers:

​1. Grab the last letter, which is "G". Our tail pointer lets us do this in time.

That's time.

Why is it time? Because the runtime doesn't get bigger if the string gets bigger. No matter how many characters are in our string, we still just have to tweak a couple pointers for any append.

Now, what if instead of a linked list, our string had been a *dynamic array*? We might not have any room at the end, forcing us to do one of those doubling operations to make space:

So with a dynamic array, our append would have a _worst-case_ time cost of .

**Linked lists have worst-case -time appends, which is better than the worst-case time of dynamic arrays.**

That *worst-case* part is important. The *average case* runtime for appends to linked lists and dynamic arrays is the same: .

Now, what if we wanted to *pre*pend something to our string? Let's say we wanted to put a "B" at the beginning.

For our linked list, it's just as easy as appending. Create the node:

And tweak some pointers:

1.  Point "B"'s next to "L". 2. Point the head to "B".

Bam. time again.

But if our string were a *dynamic array*...

Eep. We have to _make room_ for the "B"!

We have to move *each character* one space down:

_Now_ we can drop the "B" in there:

What's our time cost here?

It's all in the step where we made room for the first letter. We had to move *all n* characters in our string. One at a time. That's time.

**So linked lists have faster *pre*pends ( time) than dynamic arrays ( time).**

No "worst case" caveat this time --- prepends for dynamic arrays are *always* time. And prepends for linked lists are *always* time.

These quick appends and prepends for linked lists come from the fact that linked list nodes can go anywhere in memory. They don't have to sit right next to each other the way items in an array do.

So if linked lists are so great, why do we usually store strings in an array? **Because** [**arrays have -time lookups**](https://dev.to/bgoonz/common-data-structures-their-background-11eg#constant-time-array-lookups)**.** And those constant-time lookups *come from* the fact that all the array elements are lined up next to each other in memory.

Lookups with a linked list are more of a process, because we have no way of knowing where the ith node is in memory. So we have to walk through the linked list node by node, counting as we go, until we hit the ith item.

def get_ith_item_in_linked_list(head, i): if i < 0: raise ValueError("i can't be negative: %d" % i) current_node = head current_position = 0 while current_node: if current_position == i: # Found it! return current_node # Move on to the next node current_node = current_node.next current_position += 1 raise ValueError('List has fewer than i + 1 (%d) nodes' % (i + 1))

That's i + 1 steps down our linked list to get to the ith node (we made our function zero-based to match indices in arrays). **So linked lists have -time lookups.** Much slower than the -time lookups for arrays and dynamic arrays.

Not only that --- **walking down a linked list is *not* cache-friendly.** Because the next node could be *anywhere* in memory, we don't get any benefit from the processor cache. This means lookups in a linked list are even slower.

So the tradeoff with linked lists is they have faster prepends and faster appends than dynamic arrays, *but* they have slower lookups.

## Doubly Linked Lists

In a basic linked list, each item stores a single pointer to the next element.

In a **doubly linked list**, items have pointers to the next *and the previous* nodes.

[![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/56f6c06117255c0c01115ccff8cca2d49baaaaee8fd1a0b33a8e2769605bb9c5/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f3830302f302a4f45415072396f4c5554576f766d3836)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/56f6c06117255c0c01115ccff8cca2d49baaaaee8fd1a0b33a8e2769605bb9c5/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f3830302f302a4f45415072396f4c5554576f766d3836)

Doubly linked lists allow us to traverse our list _backwards_. In a _singly_ linked list, if you just had a pointer to a node in the _middle_ of a list, there would be _no way_ to know what nodes came before it. Not a problem in a doubly linked list.

### Not cache-friendly

Most computers have [caching systems that make reading from sequential addresses in memory faster than reading from scattered addresses](https://www.interviewcake.com/article/data-structures-coding-interview#ram).

[Array](https://www.interviewcake.com/concept/array) items are always located right next to each other in computer memory, but linked list nodes can be scattered all over.

So iterating through a linked list is usually quite a bit slower than iterating through the items in an array, even though they're both theoretically time.

---

### Hash tables

Quick lookups are often really important. For that reason, we tend to use arrays (-time lookups) much more often than linked lists (-time lookups).

For example, suppose we wanted to count how many times each ASCII character appears in [Romeo and Juliet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GITenberg/The-Tragedy-of-Romeo-and-Juliet_1112/master/1112.txt). How would we store those counts?

We can use arrays in a clever way here. Remember --- characters are just numbers. In ASCII (a common character encoding) 'A' is 65, 'B' is 66, etc.

So we can use the character('s number value) as the *index* in our array, and store the *count* for that character *at that index* in the array:

[![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/8d1e930d1c1418b3d03a313a62361f2ed40b4f8c787e7df34d6090f8ba6737df/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f3830302f302a38346a575f52666857324d4e714c476c)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/8d1e930d1c1418b3d03a313a62361f2ed40b4f8c787e7df34d6090f8ba6737df/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f3830302f302a38346a575f52666857324d4e714c476c)

With this array, we can look up (and edit) the count for any character in constant time. Because we can access any index in our array in constant time.

Something interesting is happening here --- this array isn't just a list of values. This array is storing *two* things: characters and counts. The characters are *implied* by the indices.

**So we can think of an array as a *table* with *two columns*...except you don't really get to pick the values in one column (the indices) --- they're always 0, 1, 2, 3, etc.**

But what if we wanted to put *any* value in that column and still get quick lookups?

Suppose we wanted to count the number of times each *word* appears in Romeo and Juliet. Can we adapt our array?

Translating a *character* into an array index was easy. But we'll have to do something more clever to translate a *word* (a string) into an array index...

[![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/f411c3336c331391620b7b6ae004392f83d2c7b8e73931623be1193d762f3de1/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f3830302f302a59754c494a536d6b49636176656f426b)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/f411c3336c331391620b7b6ae004392f83d2c7b8e73931623be1193d762f3de1/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f3830302f302a59754c494a536d6b49636176656f426b)

Here's one way we could do it:

Grab the number value for each character and add those up.

[![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/392807a3d97f2205f464230020a1c8e8fafaecb0e19e1ead680d0d9f471c65ba/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f3830302f302a76694830664e764a4b65703830656348)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/392807a3d97f2205f464230020a1c8e8fafaecb0e19e1ead680d0d9f471c65ba/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f3830302f302a76694830664e764a4b65703830656348)

The result is 429. But what if we only have _30_ slots in our array? We'll use a common trick for forcing a number into a specific range: the modulus operator (%). Modding our sum by 30 ensures we get a whole number that's less than 30 (and at least 0):

429 \: \% \: 30 = 9

Bam. That'll get us from a word (or any string) to an array index.

This data structure is called a **hash table** or **hash map**. In our hash table, the *counts* are the **values** and the *words* ("lies, " etc.) are the **keys** (analogous to the *indices* in an array). The process we used to translate a key into an array index is called a **hashing function**.

![A blank array except for a 20, labeled as the value, stored at index

The diamond points to the 9th index of the array.]([](https://www.interviewcake.com/images/svgs/cs_for_hackers__hash_tables_lies_key_labeled.svg?bust=209)[https://www.interviewcake.com/images/svgs/cs_for_hackers\_\_hash_tables_lies_key_labeled.svg?bust=209](https://www.interviewcake.com/images/svgs/cs_for_hackers%5C_%5C_hash_tables_lies_key_labeled.svg?bust=209))

The hashing functions used in modern systems get pretty complicated --- the one we used here is a simplified example.

Note that our quick lookups are only in one direction --- we can quickly get the value for a given key, but the only way to get the key for a given value is to walk through all the values and keys.

Same thing with arrays --- we can quickly look up the value at a given index, but the only way to figure out the index for a given value is to walk through the whole array.

One problem --- what if two keys hash to the same index in our array? Look at "lies" and "foes":

[![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/860127705ca3d3fcecfdd6671c790b19c1d868c272f319f31b0ace0e606659fe/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f3830302f302a4645475542625368796744545f586d70)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/860127705ca3d3fcecfdd6671c790b19c1d868c272f319f31b0ace0e606659fe/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f3830302f302a4645475542625368796744545f586d70)

They both sum up to 429! So of course they'll have the same answer when we mod by 30:

429 \: \% \: 30 = 9

So our hashing function gives us the same answer for "lies" and "foes." This is called a **hash collision**. There are a few different strategies for dealing with them.

Here's a common one: instead of storing the actual values in our array, let's have each array slot hold a *pointer* to a *linked list* holding the counts for all the words that hash to that index:

One problem --- how do we know which count is for "lies" and which is for "foes"? To fix this, we'll store the _word_ as well as the count in each linked list node:

[![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/1dcb69eabe60f093b98347f801c8c7a59c10fba7f5ded200c91e96bf1043baf5/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f3830302f302a7a5571714b344e4a696c366e436a6c4b)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/1dcb69eabe60f093b98347f801c8c7a59c10fba7f5ded200c91e96bf1043baf5/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f3830302f302a7a5571714b344e4a696c366e436a6c4b)

"But wait!" you may be thinking, "Now lookups in our hash table take time in the worst case, since we have to walk down a linked list." That's true! You could even say that in the worst case _every_ key creates a hash collision, so our whole hash table _degrades to a linked list_.

In industry though, we usually wave our hands and say **collisions are rare enough that on *average* lookups in a hash table are time**. And there are fancy algorithms that keep the number of collisions low and keep the lengths of our linked lists nice and short.

But that's sort of the tradeoff with hash tables. You get fast lookups by key...except *some* lookups could be slow. And of course, you only get those fast lookups in one direction --- looking up the *key* for a given *value* still takes time

### Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Breadth-First Traversal

**Breadth-first search** (BFS) is a method for exploring a tree or graph. In a BFS, you first explore all the nodes one step away, then all the nodes two steps away, etc.

Breadth-first search is like throwing a stone in the center of a pond. The nodes you explore "ripple out" from the starting point.

Here's a how a BFS would traverse this tree, starting with the root:

[![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/ca0fed169ff126080162b0d4efc3f6a99f5b9d7f19b794b8f62a30237e1f72a2/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f3830302f302a6d34363376542d676c33583846364153)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/ca0fed169ff126080162b0d4efc3f6a99f5b9d7f19b794b8f62a30237e1f72a2/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f3830302f302a6d34363376542d676c33583846364153)

We'd visit all the immediate children (all the nodes that're one step away from our starting node):

[![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/893fcfe7d9a610d9c376ca91833d0b8f0785acc5dc88f9e652a5b37728760181/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f3830302f302a5f756e3078734b44703270674e506f4d)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/893fcfe7d9a610d9c376ca91833d0b8f0785acc5dc88f9e652a5b37728760181/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f3830302f302a5f756e3078734b44703270674e506f4d)

Then we'd move on to all _those_ nodes' children (all the nodes that're _two steps_ away from our starting node):

And so on:

Until we reach the end.

Breadth-first search is often compared with **depth-first search**.

Advantages:

- A BFS will find the **shortest path** between the starting point and

any other reachable node. A depth-first search will not necessarily find the shortest path.

Disadvantages

- A BFS on a binary tree *generally* requires more memory than a DFS.

### Binary Search Tree

A **binary tree** is a **tree** where <==(**_every node has two or fewer children_**)==>.\
The children are usually called **_left_** and **_right_**.

class BinaryTreeNode(object):

This lets us build a structure like this:

[![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/990f80d0784813eccd717327172dccb6feaec537d23021c9be8cdfe60992ba42/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f3830302f302a6a725650484835413630636e69337159)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/990f80d0784813eccd717327172dccb6feaec537d23021c9be8cdfe60992ba42/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f3830302f302a6a725650484835413630636e69337159)

That particular example is special because every level of the tree is completely full. There are no "gaps." We call this kind of tree "**perfect**."

Binary trees have a few interesting properties when they're perfect:

**Property 1: the number of total nodes on each "level" doubles as we move down the tree.**

[![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/8ced6ded62dd04e04f917d305291236fa9b645a0837c67d0fe0e3ce94e4643ca/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f3830302f302a72316e5471624e5f544a79616154344c)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/8ced6ded62dd04e04f917d305291236fa9b645a0837c67d0fe0e3ce94e4643ca/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f3830302f302a72316e5471624e5f544a79616154344c)

**Property 2: the number of nodes on the last level is equal to the sum of the number of nodes on all other levels (plus 1).** In other words, about _half_ of our nodes are on the last level.

<==(**Let's call the number of nodes n, **)==>

<==(**\_**and the height of the tree h. **\_**)==>

**h can also be thought of as the "number of levels."**

If we had h, how could we calculate n?

Let's just add up the number of nodes on each level!

If we zero-index the levels, the number of nodes on the xth level is exactly 2^x.

1.  Level 0: 2⁰ nodes,
2.  2\. Level 1: 2¹ nodes,
3.  3\. Level 2: 2² nodes,
4.  4\. Level 3: 2³ nodes,
5.  5\. *etc*

So our total number of nodes is:

**n = 2⁰ + 2¹ + 2² + 2³ + ... + 2^{h-1}**

Why only up to 2^{h-1}?

Notice that we **started counting our levels at 0.**

- So if we have h levels in total,
- the last level is actually the "h-1"-th level.
- That means the number of nodes on the last level is 2^{h-1}.

But we can simplify.

**Property 2 tells us that the number of nodes on the last level is (1 more than) half of the total number of nodes**,

**so we can just take the number of nodes on the last level, multiply it by 2, and subtract 1 to get the number of nodes overall**.

- We know the number of nodes on the last level is 2^{h-1},
- So:

**n = 2^{h-1} _ 2--1\
n = 2^{h-1} _ 2¹ --- 1\
n = 2^{h-1+1}- 1\
n = 2^{h} --- 1**

So that's how we can go from h to n. What about the other direction?

We need to bring the h down from the exponent.

That's what logs are for!

First, some quick review.

<==(log\_{10} (100) )==>

simply means,

**"What power must you raise 10 to in order to get 100?"**.

Which is 2,

because .

<==(10² = 100 )==>

### Graph Data Structure: Directed, Acyclic, etc

Graph =====

### Binary numbers

Let's put those bits to use. Let's store some stuff. Starting with numbers.

The number system we usually use (the one you probably learned in elementary school) is called **base 10**, because each digit has *ten* possible values (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 0).

But computers don't have digits with ten possible values. They have *bits* with *two* possible values. So they use **base 2** numbers.

Base 10 is also called **decimal**. Base 2 is also called **binary**.

To understand binary, let's take a closer look at how decimal numbers work. Take the number "101" in decimal:

[![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/fc802e73f1ef094949162a929fdf1fb252b02df030561d3d3622291c1f7600f7/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f3830302f302a53654c39326c636d5f525475472d3332)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/fc802e73f1ef094949162a929fdf1fb252b02df030561d3d3622291c1f7600f7/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f3830302f302a53654c39326c636d5f525475472d3332)

Notice we have two "1"s here, but they don't _mean_ the same thing. The leftmost "1" _means_ 100, and the rightmost "1" _means_ 1. That's because the leftmost "1" is in the hundreds place, while the rightmost "1" is in the ones place. And the "0" between them is in the tens place.

[![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/25bd7c4f77c852191bf68fa626910583501e1fa518cbb7264664c5b5541b6151/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f3830302f302a356b794c774974464c4a697773445259)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/25bd7c4f77c852191bf68fa626910583501e1fa518cbb7264664c5b5541b6151/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f3830302f302a356b794c774974464c4a697773445259)

**So this "101" in base 10 is telling us we have "1 hundred, 0 tens, and 1 one."**

[![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/496ab15fd74a0098d3c8c03bd7ccf0b23d3dde69f82a4520a947a55cef6a1250/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f3830302f302a4248545971796d453737436e7a4b7050)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/496ab15fd74a0098d3c8c03bd7ccf0b23d3dde69f82a4520a947a55cef6a1250/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f3830302f302a4248545971796d453737436e7a4b7050)

Notice how the _places_ in base 10 (ones place, tens place, hundreds place, etc.) are _sequential powers of 10_:

- 10⁰=1 _ 10¹=10 _ 10²=100 _ 10³=1000 _ etc.

**The places in *binary* (base 2) are sequential powers of *2*:**

- 2⁰=1 _ 2¹=2 _ 2²=4 _ 2³=8 _ etc.

So let's take that same "101" but this time let's read it as a *binary* number:

[![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/257ef236d9d9ab6251b12ea348e2e4d7e29995deb5b73cbf07aec225f65160b6/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f3830302f302a704b456e4a394a4347634d6170694734)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/257ef236d9d9ab6251b12ea348e2e4d7e29995deb5b73cbf07aec225f65160b6/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f3830302f302a704b456e4a394a4347634d6170694734)

Reading this from right to left: we have a 1 in the ones place, a 0 in the twos place, and a 1 in the fours place. So our total is 4 + 0 + 1 which is 5.

# Deploy React App To Heroku Using Postgres & Express

Heroku is an web application that makes deploying applications easy for a beginner.

---

### Deploy React App To Heroku Using Postgres & Express

Heroku is an web application that makes deploying applications easy for a beginner.

Before you begin deploying, make sure to remove any `console.log`'s or `debugger`'s in any production code. You can search your entire project folder if you are using them anywhere.

You will set up Heroku to run on a production, not development, version of your application. When a Node.js application like yours is pushed up to Heroku, it is identified as a Node.js application because of the `package.json` file. It runs `npm install` automatically. Then, if there is a `heroku-postbuild` script in the `package.json` file, it will run that script. Afterwards, it will automatically run `npm start`.

In the following phases, you will configure your application to work in production, not just in development, and configure the `package.json` scripts for `install`, `heroku-postbuild` and `start` scripts to install, build your React application, and start the Express production server.

### Phase 1: Heroku Connection

If you haven't created a Heroku account yet, create one [here](https://signup.heroku.com/).

Add a new application in your [Heroku dashboard](https://dashboard.heroku.com/) named whatever you want. Under the "Resources" tab in your new application, click "Find more add-ons" and add the "Heroku Postgres" add-on with the free Hobby Dev setting.

In your terminal, install the [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-command-line). Afterwards, login to Heroku in your terminal by running the following:

```
heroku login

```

Add Heroku as a remote to your project's git repository in the following command and replace `<name-of-Heroku-app>` with the name of the application you created in the [Heroku dashboard](https://dashboard.heroku.com/).

```
heroku git:remote -a <name-of-Heroku-app>

```

Next, you will set up your Express + React application to be deployable to Heroku.

### Phase 2: Setting up your Express + React application

Right now, your React application is on a different localhost port than your Express application. However, since your React application only consists of static files that don't need to bundled continuously with changes in production, your Express application can serve the React assets in production too. These static files live in the `frontend/build` folder after running `npm run build` in the `frontend` folder.

Add the following changes into your `backend/routes.index.js` file.

At the root route, serve the React application's static `index.html` file along with `XSRF-TOKEN` cookie. Then serve up all the React application's static files using the `express.static` middleware. Serve the `index.html` and set the `XSRF-TOKEN` cookie again on all routes that don't start in `/api`. You should already have this set up in `backend/routes/index.js` which should now look like this:

```
// backend/routes/index.js
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();
const apiRouter = require('./api');

router.use('/api', apiRouter);

// Static routes
// Serve React build files in production
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
  const path = require('path');
  // Serve the frontend's index.html file at the root route
  router.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.cookie('XSRF-TOKEN', req.csrfToken());
    res.sendFile(
      path.resolve(__dirname, '../../frontend', 'build', 'index.html')
    );
  });

  // Serve the static assets in the frontend's build folder
  router.use(express.static(path.resolve("../frontend/build")));

  // Serve the frontend's index.html file at all other routes NOT starting with /api
  router.get(/^(?!\/?api).*/, (req, res) => {
    res.cookie('XSRF-TOKEN', req.csrfToken());
    res.sendFile(
      path.resolve(__dirname, '../../frontend', 'build', 'index.html')
    );
  });
}

// Add a XSRF-TOKEN cookie in development
if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {
  router.get('/api/csrf/restore', (req, res) => {
    res.cookie('XSRF-TOKEN', req.csrfToken());
    res.status(201).json({});
  });
}

module.exports = router;

```

Your Express backend's `package.json` should include scripts to run the `sequelize` CLI commands.

The `backend/package.json`'s scripts should now look like this:

```
"scripts": {
    "sequelize": "sequelize",
    "sequelize-cli": "sequelize-cli",
    "start": "per-env",
    "start:development": "nodemon -r dotenv/config ./bin/www",
    "start:production": "node ./bin/www"
  },

```

Initialize a `package.json` file at the very root of your project directory (outside of both the `backend` and `frontend` folders). The scripts defined in this `package.json` file will be run by Heroku, not the scripts defined in the `backend/package.json` or the `frontend/package.json`.

When Heroku runs `npm install`, it should install packages for both the `backend` and the `frontend`. Overwrite the `install` script in the root `package.json` with:

```
npm --prefix backend install backend && npm --prefix frontend install frontend

```

This will run `npm install` in the `backend` folder then run `npm install` in the `frontend` folder.

Next, define a `heroku-postbuild` script that will run the `npm run build` command in the `frontend` folder. Remember, Heroku will automatically run this script after running `npm install`.

Define a `sequelize` script that will run `npm run sequelize` in the `backend` folder.

Finally, define a `start` that will run `npm start` in the `backend folder.

The root `package.json`'s scripts should look like this:

```
"scripts": {
    "heroku-postbuild": "npm run build --prefix frontend",
    "install": "npm --prefix backend install backend && npm --prefix frontend install frontend",
    "dev:backend": "npm install --prefix backend start",
    "dev:frontend": "npm install --prefix frontend start",
    "sequelize": "npm run --prefix backend sequelize",
    "sequelize-cli": "npm run --prefix backend sequelize-cli",
    "start": "npm start --prefix backend"
  },

```

The `dev:backend` and `dev:frontend` scripts are optional and will not be used for Heroku.

Finally, commit your changes.

### Phase 3: Deploy to Heroku

Once you're finished setting this up, navigate to your application's Heroku dashboard. Under "Settings" there is a section for "Config Vars". Click the `Reveal Config Vars` button to see all your production environment variables. You should have a `DATABASE_URL` environment variable already from the Heroku Postgres add-on.

Add environment variables for `JWT_EXPIRES_IN` and `JWT_SECRET` and any other environment variables you need for production.

You can also set environment variables through the Heroku CLI you installed earlier in your terminal. See the docs for [Setting Heroku Config Variables](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/config-vars).

Push your project to Heroku. Heroku only allows the `master` branch to be pushed. But, you can alias your branch to be named `master` when pushing to Heroku. For example, to push a branch called `login-branch` to `master` run:

```
git push heroku login-branch:master

```

If you do want to push the `master` branch, just run:

```
git push heroku master

```

You may want to make two applications on Heroku, the `master` branch site that should have working code only. And your `staging` site that you can use to test your work in progress code.

Now you need to migrate and seed your production database.

Using the Heroku CLI, you can run commands inside of your production application just like in development using the `heroku run` command.

For example to migrate the production database, run:

```
heroku run npm run sequelize db:migrate

```

To seed the production database, run:

```
heroku run npm run sequelize db:seed:all

```

Note: You can interact with your database this way as you'd like, but beware that `db:drop` cannot be run in the Heroku environment. If you want to drop and create the database, you need to remove and add back the "Heroku Postgres" add-on.

Another way to interact with the production application is by opening a bash shell through your terminal by running:

```
heroku bash

```

In the opened shell, you can run things like `npm run sequelize db:migrate`.

Open your deployed site and check to see if you successfully deployed your Express + React application to Heroku!

If you see an `Application Error` or are experiencing different behavior than what you see in your local environment, check the logs by running:

```
heroku logs

```

If you want to open a connection to the logs to continuously output to your terminal, then run:

```
heroku logs --tail

```

The logs may clue you into why you are experiencing errors or different behavior.

# Emmet Cheat Sheet

EMMET

---

### Emmet Cheat Sheet

### EMMET

_The a toolkit for web-developers_

### Introduction

Emmet is a productivity toolkit for web developers that uses expressions to generate HTML snippets.

### Installation

Normally, installation for Emmet should be a straight-forward process from the package-manager, as most of the modern text editors support Emmet.

### Usage

You can use Emmet in two ways:

- Tab Expand Way: Type your emmet code and press `Tab` key
- Interactive Method: Press `alt + ctrl + Enter` and start typing your expressions. This should automatically generate HTML snippets on the fly.

**This cheatsheet will assume that you press** `Tab` **after each expressions.**

### HTML

### Generating HTML 5 DOCTYPE

`html:5`\
Will generate

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">
  <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>

</body>
</html>

```

### Child items

Child items are created using `>`

`ul>li>p`

```
<ul>
  <li>
    <p></p>
  </li>
</ul>

```

### Sibling Items

Sibling items are created using `+`

`html>head+body`

```
<html>
<head></head>
<body>

</body>
</html>

```

### Multiplication

Items can be multiplied by `*`

`ul>li*5`

```
<ul>
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
</ul>

```

### Grouping

Items can be grouped together using `()`

`table>(tr>th*5)+tr>t*5`

```
<table>
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th></th>
    <th></th>
    <th></th>
    <th></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <t></t>
    <t></t>
    <t></t>
    <t></t>
    <t></t>
  </tr>
</table>

```

### Class and ID

Class and Id in Emmet can be done using `.` and `#`

`div.heading`

```
<div class="heading"></div>

```

`div#heading`

```
<div id="heading"></div>

```

ID and Class can also be combined together

`div#heading.center`

```
<div id="heading" class="center"></div>

```

### Adding Content inside tags

Contents inside tags can be added using `{}`

`h1{Emmet is awesome}+h2{Every front end developers should use this}+p{This is paragraph}*2`

```
<h1>Emmet is awesome</h1>
<h2>Every front end developers should use this</h2>
<p>This is paragraph</p>
<p>This is paragraph</p>

```

### Attributes inside HTML tags

Attributes can be added using `[]`

`a[href=https://?google.com data-toggle=something target=_blank]`

```
<a href="https://?google.com" data-toggle="something" target="_blank"></a>

```

### Numbering

Numbering can be done using `$`\
You can use this inside tag or contents.

`h${This is so awesome $}*6`

```
<h1>This is so awesome 1</h1>
<h2>This is so awesome 2</h2>
<h3>This is so awesome 3</h3>
<h4>This is so awesome 4</h4>
<h5>This is so awesome 5</h5>
<h6>This is so awesome 6</h6>

```

Use `@-` to reverse the Numbering

`img[src=image$$@-.jpg]*5`

```
<img src="image05.jpg" alt="">
<img src="image04.jpg" alt="">
<img src="image03.jpg" alt="">
<img src="image02.jpg" alt="">
<img src="image01.jpg" alt="">

```

To start the numbering from specific number, use this way

`img[src=emmet$@100.jpg]*5`

```
<img src="emmet100.jpg" alt="">
<img src="emmet101.jpg" alt="">
<img src="emmet102.jpg" alt="">
<img src="emmet103.jpg" alt="">
<img src="emmet104.jpg" alt="">

```

### Tips

- Use `:` to expand known abbreviations

`input:date`

```
<input type="date" name="" id="">

```

`form:post`

```
<form action="" method="post"></form>

```

`link:css`

```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">

```

- Building Navbar

`.navbar>ul>li*3>a[href=#]{Item $@-}`

```
<div class="navbar">
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#">Item 3</a></li>
    <li><a href="#">Item 2</a></li>
    <li><a href="#">Item 1</a></li>
  </ul>
</div>

```

### CSS

Emmet works surprisingly well with css as well.

- `f:l`

```
float: left;

```

You can also use any options n/r/l

- `pos:a­`

```
position: absolute;

```

Also use any options, pos:a/r/f

- `d:n/b­/f/­i/ib`

`d:ib`

```
display: inline-block;

```

- You can use `m` for margin and `p` for padding followed by direction

`mr` -> `margin-right`

`pr` -> `padding-right`

- `@f` will result in

```
@font-face {
  font-family:;
  src:url();
}

```

You can also use these shorthands

**Pros**

1.  Easy to learn
2.  HTML-like syntax allows templating and highly detailed documentation
3.  Supports server-side rendering
4.  Easy migrating between different versions of React
5.  Uses JavaScript rather than framework-specific code

**Cons**

1.  Poor documentation
2.  Limited to only view part of MVC
3.  New developers might see JSC as a barrier

### Where to Use React

1.  For apps that have multiple events
2.  When your app development team excels in CSS, JavaScript and HTML
3.  You want to create sharable components on your app
4.  When you need a personalized app solution

### Misconceptions about React

#### [React is a framework](https://aglowiditsolutions.com/blog/react-vs-angular/):

[Many developers an](https://aglowiditsolutions.com/blog/react-vs-angular/)d aspiring students misinterpret React to be a fully functional framework. It is because we often compare React with major frameworks such as Angular and Ember. This comparison is not to compare the best frameworks but to focus on the differences and similarities of React and Angular's approach that makes their offerings worth studying. Angular works on **the MVC model** to support the Model, View, and Controller layers of an app. React focuses only on the 'V,' which is the **view layer** of an application and how to make handling it easier to integrate smoothly into a project.

#### React's Virtual DOM is faster than DOM.

React uses a **Virtual DOM**, which is essentially a tree of JavaScript objects representing the actual browser DOM. The advantage of using this for the developers is that they don't manipulate the DOM directly as developers do with jQuery when they write React apps. Instead, they would tell React how they want the DOM to make changes to the state object and allow React to make the necessary updates to the browser DOM. This helps create a comprehensive development model for developers as they don't need to track all DOM changes. They can modify the state object, and React would use its algorithms to understand what part of UI changed compared to the previous DOM. Using this information updates the actual browser DOM. Virtual DOM provides an excellent API for creating UI and minimizes the update count to be made on the browser DOM.

However, it is **not faster** than the actual DOM. You just read that it needs to pull extra strings to figure out what part of UI needs to be updated before actually performing those updates. Hence, Virtual DOM is beneficial for many things, but it **_isn't faster than DOM._**

---

### **1\. Explain how React uses a tree data structure called the virtual DOM to model the DOM**

> The virtual DOM is a copy of the actual DOM tree. Updates in React are made to the virtual DOM. React uses a diffing algorithm to reconcile the changes and send the to the DOM to commit and paint.

### **2\. Create virtual DOM nodes using JSX** To create a React virtual DOM node using JSX, define HTML syntax in a JavaScript file.

> Here, the JavaScript hello variable is set to a React virtual DOM h1 element with the text "Hello World!".

> You can also nest virtual DOM nodes in each other just like how you do it in HTML with the real DOM.

#### We use the React DevTools extension as an extension in our Browser DevTools to debug and view when a component is rendering

### **4\. Describe how JSX transforms into actual DOM nodes**

- To transfer JSX into DOM nodes, we use the ReactDOM.render method. It takes a React virtual DOM node's changes allows Babel to transpile it and sends the JS changes to commit to the DOM.

### **5\. Use the** `ReactDOM.render` **method to have React render your virtual DOM nodes under an actual DOM node**

---

### **6\. Attach an event listener to an actual DOM node using a virtual node**

The virtual DOM (VDOM) is a programming concept where an ideal, or "virtual", representation of a UI is kept in memory and synced with the "real" DOM by a library such as ReactDOM. This process is called [reconciliation](https://reactjs.org/docs/reconciliation.html).

This approach enables the declarative API of React: You tell React what state you want the UI to be in, and it makes sure the DOM matches that state. This abstracts out the attribute manipulation, event handling, and manual DOM updating that you would otherwise have to use to build your app.

Since "virtual DOM" is more of a pattern than a specific technology, people sometimes say it to mean different things. In React world, the term "virtual DOM" is usually associated with [React elements](https://reactjs.org/docs/rendering-elements.html) since they are the objects representing the user interface. React, however, also uses internal objects called "fibers" to hold additional information about the component tree. They may also be considered a part of "virtual DOM" implementation in React.

### Is the Shadow DOM the same as the Virtual DOM?

No, they are different. The Shadow DOM is a browser technology designed primarily for scoping variables and CSS in web components. The virtual DOM is a concept implemented by libraries in JavaScript on top of browser APIs.

- To add an event listener to an element, define a method to handle the event and associate that method with the element event you want to listen for:

### **7\. Use** `create-react-app` **to initialize a new React app and import required dependencies**

- Create the default create-react-application by typing in our terminal

#### [Explanation of npm vs npx from Free Code Camp:](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/npm-vs-npx-whats-the-difference/)

**npm** (node package manager) is the dependency/package manager you get out of the box when you install Node.js. It provides a way for developers to install packages both globally and locally.

Sometimes you might want to take a look at a specific package and try out some commands. But you cannot do that without installing the dependencies in your local `node_modules` folder.

### npm the package manager

npm is a couple of things. First and foremost, it is an online repository for the publishing of open-source Node.js projects.

Second, it is a CLI tool that aids you to install those packages and manage their versions and dependencies. There are hundreds of thousands of Node.js libraries and applications on npm and many more are added every day.

npm by itself doesn't run any packages. If you want to run a package using npm, you must specify that package in your `package.json` file.

When executables are installed via npm packages, npm creates links to them:

- **local** installs have links created at the `./node_modules/.bin/` directory
- **global** installs have links created from the global `bin/` directory (for example: `/usr/local/bin` on Linux or at `%AppData%/npm` on Windows)

To execute a package with npm you either have to type the local path, like this:

```
$ ./node_modules/.bin/your-package

```

or you can run a locally installed package by adding it into your `package.json` file in the scripts section, like this:

```
{
  "name": "your-application",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "scripts": {
    "your-package": "your-package"
  }
}

```

Then you can run the script using `npm run`:

```
npm run your-package

```

You can see that running a package with plain npm requires quite a bit of ceremony.

Fortunately, this is where **npx** comes in handy.

### npx the package runner

Since npm version [5.2.0](https://github.com/npm/npm/releases/tag/v5.2.0) npx is pre-bundled with npm. So it's pretty much a standard nowadays.

**npx** is also a CLI tool whose purpose is to make it easy to install and manage dependencies hosted in the npm registry.

It's now very easy to run any sort of Node.js-based executable that you would normally install via npm.

You can run the following command to see if it is already installed for your current npm version:

```
$ which npx

```

If it's not, you can install it like this:

```
$ npm install -g npx

```

Once you make sure you have it installed, let's see a few of the use cases that make **npx** extremely helpful.

### Run a locally installed package easily

If you wish to execute a locally installed package, all you need to do is type:

```
$ npx your-package

```

npx will check whether `<command>` or `<package>` exists in `$PATH`, or in the local project binaries, and if so it will execute it.

### Execute packages that are not previously installed

Another major advantage is the ability to execute a package that wasn't previously installed.

Sometimes you just want to use some CLI tools but you don't want to install them globally just to test them out. This means you can save some disk space and simply run them only when you need them. This also means your global variables will be less polluted.

> Now, where were we?

`npx create-react-app <name of app> --use-npm`

- npx gives us the latest version. `--use-npm` just means to use npm instead of yarn or some other package manager

### **8\. Pass props into a React component**

- `props` is an object that gets passed down from the parent component to the child component. The values can be of any data structure including a function (which is an object)

- You can also [interpolate values](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals) into JSX.
- Set a variable to the string, "world", and replace the string of "world" in the NavLinks JSX element with the variable wrapped in curly braces:

> **Accessing props:**

To access our props object in another component we pass it the props argument and React will invoke the functional component with the props object.

### Reminder:

Conceptually, components are like JavaScript functions. They accept arbitrary inputs (called "props") and return React elements describing what should appear on the screen.

### Function and Class Components

The simplest way to define a component is to write a JavaScript function:

```
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}

```

This function is a valid React component because it accepts a single "props" (which stands for properties) object argument with data and returns a React element. We call such components "function components" because they are literally JavaScript functions.

You can also use an [ES6 class](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes) to define a component:

```
class Welcome extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;
  }
}

```

The above two components are equivalent from React's point of view.

- You can pass down **as many props keys as you want**.

### **9\. Destructure props**

> You can destructure the props object in the function component's parameter.

### **10\. Create routes using components from the react-router-dom package**

a. Import the react-router-dom package:

```
npm i react-router-dom

```

> In your index.js:

1.  Above you import your BrowserRouter with which you can wrap your entire route hierarchy. This makes routing information from React Router available to all its descendent components.
2.  Then in the component of your choosing, usually top tier such as App.js, you can create your routes using the Route and Switch Components

# Everything You Need To Know About Relational Databases, SQL, PostgreSQL and Sequelize To Build...

For Front end developers who like myself struggle with making the jump to fullstack.

#### [CODEX](http://medium.com/codex)

### **Everything You Need To Know About Relational Databases, SQL, PostgreSQL and Sequelize To Build Your Backend!**

**For Front end developers who like myself struggle with making the jump to fullstack.**

You can access and query the data using the findByPk, findOne, and findAll methods.

**Terminology:**

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) We re going to use this to run JavaScript code on the server. I ve decided to use the latest version of Node, v6.3.0 at the time of writing, so that we ll have access to most of the new features introduced in ES6.
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/) As per their website, Express is a Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js , that we re going to be building our Todo list application on.
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/static/index.html) This is a powerful open-source database that we re going to use. I ve attached an article I published on the setup below!

[**PostgreSQL Setup For Windows & WSL/Ubuntu**\
*If you follow this guide to a tee you will install PostgreSQL itself on your Windows installation. Then, you will* bryanguner.medium.com](https://bryanguner.medium.com/postgresql-setup-for-windows-wsl-ubuntu-801672ab7089 "https://bryanguner.medium.com/postgresql-setup-for-windows-wsl-ubuntu-801672ab7089")

- However, if you face issues while installing PostgreSQL, or you don t want to dive into installing it, you can opt for a version of PostgreSQL hosted online. I recommend [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com/). I found it s pretty easy to get started with. However, the free version will only give you a 20MB allowance.
- [Sequelize](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/en/latest/) In addition, we re going to use Sequelize, which is a database [ORM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping) that will interface with the Postgres database for us.

**RDBMS and Database Entities**

**Define what a relational database management system is**

- RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System
- A software application that you run that your programs can connect to so that they can store, modify, and retrieve data.
- An RDBMS can track many databases. We will use PostgreSQL, or postgres , primarily for our RDBMS and it will be able to create individual databases for each of our projects.

**Describe what relational data is**

- In general, relational data is information that is connected to other pieces of information.
- When working with relational databases, we can connect two entries together utilizing foreign keys (explained below).
- In a pets database, we could be keeping track of dogs and cats as well as the toys that each of them own. That ownership of a cat to a toy is the relational aspect of relational data. Two pieces of information that can be connected together to show some sort of meaning.

**Define what a database is**

- The actual location that data is stored.
- A database can be made up of many tables that each store specific kinds of information.
- We could have a pets database that stores information about many different types of animals. Each animal type could potentially be represented by a different table.

**Define what a database table is**

- Within a database, a table stores one specific kind of information.
- The records (entries) on these tables can be connected to records on other tables through the use of foreign keys
- In our pets database, we could have a dogs table, with individual records

**Describe the purpose of a primary key**

- A primary key is used in the database as a unique identifier for the table.
- We often use an id field that simply increments with each entry. The incrementing ensures that each record has a unique identifier, even if their are other fields of the record that are repeated (two people with the same name would still need to have a unique identifier, for example).
- With a unique identifier, we can easily connect records within the table to records from other tables.

**Describe the purpose of a foreign key**

- A foreign key is used as the connector from this record to the primary key of another table s record.
- In our pets example, we can imagine two tables to demonstrate: a table to represent cats and a table to represent toys. Each of these tables has a primary key of id that is used as the unique identifier. In order to make a connection between a toy and a cat, we can add another field to the cat table called owner_id , indicating that it is a foreign key for the cat table. By setting a toy s owner_id to the same value as a particular cat s id , we can indicate that the cat is the owner of that toy.

**Describe how to properly name things in PostgreSQL**

- Names within postgres should generally consist of only lowercase letters, numbers, and underscores.
- Tables within a database are plural by convention, so a table for cats would typically be cats and office locations would be office_locations (all lowercase, underscores to replace spaces, plural)

**Connect to an instance of PostgreSQL with the command line tool psql**

- The psql command by default will try to connect to a database and username that matches your system s username
- We connect to a different database by providing an argument to the psql command
- psql pets
- To connect with a different username we can use the -U flag followed by the username we would like to use. To connect to the pets database as pets_user
- psql -U pets_user pets
- If there is a password for the user, we can tell psql that we would like a prompt for the password to show up by using the -W flag.
- psql -U pets_user -W pets (the order of our flags doesn t matter, as long as any arguments associated with them are together, such as pets_user directly following -U in this example)

**Identify whether a user is a normal user or a superuser by the prompt in the psql shell**

- You can tell if you are logged in as a superuser or normal user by the prompt in the terminal.
- If the prompt shows =>, the user is a normal user
- If the prompt show =#, the user is a superuser

**Create a user for the relational database management system**

- Within psql, we can create a user with the CREATE USER {username} {WITH options} command.
- The most common options we ll want to use are WITH PASSWORD 'mypassword' to provide a password for the user we are creating, CREATEDB to allow the user to create new databases, or SUPERUSER to create a user with all elevated permissions.

**Create a database in the database management system**

- We can use the command CREATE DATABASE {database name} {options} inside psql to create a new database.
- A popular option we may utilize is WITH OWNER {owner name} to set another user as the owner of the database we are making.

**Configure a database so that only the owner (and superusers) can connect to it**

- We can GRANT and REVOKE privileges from a database to users or categories of users.
- In order to remove connection privileges to a database from the public we can use REVOKE CONNECT ON DATABASE {db_name} FROM PUBLIC;, removing all public connection access.
- If we wanted to grant it back, or to a specific user, we could similarly do GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE {db_name} FROM {specific user, PUBLIC, etc.};

**View a list of databases in an installation of PostgreSQL**

- To list all databases we can use the \l or \list command in psql.

**Create tables in a database**

```
CREATE TABLE {table name} (
{columnA} {typeA},
{columnB} {typeB},
etc...
);

```

- The whitespace does not matter. Creating the SQL statements on multiple lines is easier to read, but just like JavaScript, they can be presented differently.
- One common issue is that SQL does not like trailing commas, so the last column cannot have a comma after its type in this example.

**View a list of tables in a database**

- To list all database tables, use the \dt command.

**Identify and describe the common data types used in PostgreSQL**

- There are many different data types that we can use in our tables, here are some common examples:
- SERIAL: autoincrementing, very useful for IDs
- VARCHAR(n): a string with a character limit of n
- TEXT: doesn t have character limit, but less performant
- BOOLEAN: true/false
- SMALLINT: signed two-byte integer (-32768 to 32767)
- INTEGER: signed four-byte integer (standard)
- BIGINT: signed eight-byte integer (very large numbers)
- NUMERIC: or DECIMAL, can store exact decimal values
- TIMESTAMP: date and time

**Describe the purpose of the UNIQUE and NOT NULL constraints, and create columns in database tables that have them**

- In addition to the data type, we can provide flags for constraints to place on our column data.
- The UNIQUE flag indicates that the data for the column must not be repeated.
- By default we can create entries in our tables that are missing data from columns. When creating a pet, maybe we don t provide an age because we don t know it, for example. If we want to require that the data be present in order to create a new record, we can indicate that column must be NOT NULL.
- In the example below, we are requiring our pets to have unique names and for them to be present (both UNIQUE and NOT NULL). We have no such constraints on the age column, allowing repetition of ages or their complete absence.

```
CREATE TABLE pets (
id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
name VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
age SMALLINT
);

```

**Create a primary key for a table**

- When creating a table we can indicate the primary key by passing in the column name to parentheses like so:

```
CREATE TABLE people (
id SERIAL,
first_name VARCHAR(50),
last_name VARCHAR(50),
PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

```

- We could have also used the PRIMARY KEY flag on the column definition itself:

```
CREATE TABLE people (
id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
first_name VARCHAR(50),
last_name VARCHAR(50)
);

```

**Create foreign key constraints to relate tables**

- In our table definition, we can use the line FOREIGN KEY (foreign_key_stored_in_this_table) REFERENCE {other table} ({other_tables_key_name}) to connect two tables.
- This is probably easier to see in an example:

```
CREATE TABLE people (
id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
first_name VARCHAR(50),
last_name VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE pets (
id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
name VARCHAR(255),
age SMALLINT,
person_id INTEGER,
FOREIGN KEY (person_id) REFERENCES people (id)
);

```

**SQL is not case sensitive for its keywords but is for its entity names**

- Exactly as the LO states, CREATE TABLE and create table are interpreted the same way. Using capitalization is a good convention in order to distinguish your keywords.
- The entity names that we use ARE case-sensitive, however. So a table named pets is unique from a table named Pets. In general, we prefer to use all lowercase for our entities to avoid any of this confusion.

**SQL**

1.  How to use the SELECT ... FROM ... statement to select data from a single table

- Supply the column names in the SELECT clause. If we want all columns, we can also use \*
- Supply the table names in the FROM clause

--- Selects all columns from the friends table

```
SELECT
*
FROM
friends;

```

--- Selects the first_name column from the friends table (remember whitespace is ignored)\
SELECT name\
FROM friends;

- Sometimes we may need to specify what table we are selecting a column from, particulurly if we had joined multiple tables together.

--- Notice here we are indicating that we want the "name" field from the "friends" table as well as the "name" field from the "puppies" table. We indicate the table name by table.column\
 --- We are also aliasing these fields with the AS keyword so that our returned results have friend_name and puppy_name as field headers

```
SELECT
friends.name AS friend_name , puppies.name AS puppy_name
FROM
friends
JOIN
puppies ON friends.puppy_id = puppies.id

```

**How to use the WHERE clause on SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements to narrow the scope of the command**

- The WHERE clause allows us to select or apply actions to records that match specific criteria instead of to a whole table.
- We can use WHERE with a couple of different operators when making our comparison
- WHERE {column} = {value} provides an exact comparison
- WHERE {column} IN ({value1}, {value2}, {value3}, etc.) matches any provided value in the IN statement. We can make this more complex by having a subquery inside of the parentheses, having our column match any values within the returned results.
- WHERE {column} BETWEEN {value1} AND {value2} can check for matches between two values (numeric ranges)
- WHERE {column} LIKE {pattern} can check for matches to a string. This is most useful when we use the wildcard %, such as WHERE breed LIKE '%Shepherd', which will match any breed that ends in Shepherd
- The NOT operator can also be used for negation in the checks.
- Mathematical operators can be used when performing calculations or comparisons within a query as well, such as

```
SELECT name, breed, weight_lbs FROM puppies WHERE weight_lbs > 50; --- OR SELECT name, breed, age_yrs FROM puppies WHERE age_yrs * 10 = 5;

```

**How to use the JOIN keyword to join two (or more) tables together into a single virtual table**

- When we want to get information from a related table or do querying based on related table values, we can join the connected table by comparing the foreign key to where it lines up on the other table:

--- Here we are joining the puppies table on to the friends table. We are specifying that the comparison we should make is the foreign key puppy_id on the friends table should line up with the primary key id on the puppies table.

```
SELECT
*
FROM
friends
JOIN
puppies ON friends.puppy_id = puppies.id

```

**How to use the INSERT statement to insert data into a table**

- When a table is already created we can then insert records into it using the INSERT INTO keywords.
- We provide the name of the table that we would like to add records to, followed by the VALUES keyword and each record we are adding. Here s an example:

--- We are providing the table name, then multiple records to insert\
 --- The values are listed in the order that they are defined on the table

```
INSERT INTO table_name
VALUES
(column1_value, colum2_value, column3_value),
(column1_value, colum2_value, column3_value),
(column1_value, colum2_value, column3_value);

```

- We can also specify columns when we are inserting data. This makes it clear which fields we are providing data for and allows us to provide them out of order, skip null or default values, etc.

--- In this example, we want to use the default value for id since it is autoincremented, so we provide DEFAULT for this field

```
INSERT INTO friends (id, first_name, last_name)
VALUES
(DEFAULT, 'Amy', 'Pond');

```

--- Alternatively, we can leave it out completely, since the default value will be used if none is provided

```
INSERT INTO friends (first_name, last_name)
VALUES
('Rose', 'Tyler'),
('Martha', 'Jones'),
('Donna', 'Noble'),
('River', 'Song');

```

**How to use an UPDATE statement to update data in a table**

- The UPDATE keyword can be used to find records and change their values in our database.
- We generally follow the pattern of UPDATE {table} SET {column} = {new value} WHERE {match condition};.
- Without a condition to narrow our records down, we will update every record in the table, so this is an important thing to double check!
- We can update multiple fields as well by specifying each column in parentheses and their associated new values: UPDATE {table} SET ({column1}, {column2}) = ({value1}, {value2}) WHERE {match condition};

--- Updates the pet with id of 4 to change their name and breed

```
UPDATE
pets
SET
(name, breed) = ('Floofy', 'Fluffy Dog Breed') WHERE id = 4;

```

**How to use a DELETE statement to remove data from a table**

- Similar to selecting records, we can delete records from a table by specifying what table we are deleting from and what criteria we would like to match in order to delete.
- We follow the general structure DELETE FROM {table} WHERE {condition};
- The condition here is also very important! Without a condition, all records match and will be deleted.

--- Deletes from the pets table any record that either has a name Floofy, a name Doggo, or an id of 3.

```
DELETE FROM
pets
WHERE
name IN ('Floofy', 'Doggo') OR id = 3;

```

**How to use a seed file to populate data in a database**

- Seed files are a great way for us to create records that we want to start our database out with.
- Instead of having to individually add records to our tables or manually entering them in psql or postbird, we can create a file that has all of these records and then just pass this file to psql to run.
- Seed files are also great if we ever need to reset our database. We can clear out any records that we have by dropping all of our tables, then just run our seed files to get it into a predetermined starting point. This is great for our personal projects, testing environments, starting values for new tables we create, etc.
- There are two main ways we can use a seed file with psql, the < and the | operators. They perform the same function for us, just in slightly different orders, taking the content of a .sql file and executing in within the psql environment:
- psql -d {database} < {sql filepath}
- cat {sql filepath} | psql -d {database}

**SQL (continued)**

**How to perform relational database design**

- Steps to Designing the Database:
- Define the entities. What data are are you storing, what are the fields for each entity?
- You can think of this in similar ways to OOP (object oriented programming).
- If you wanted to model this information using classes, what classes would you make? Those are generally going to be the tables that are created in your database.
- The attributes of your classes are generally going to be the fields/columns that we need for each table.
- Identify primary keys. Most of the time these will be ids that you can generate as a serial field, incrementing with each addition to the database.
- Establish table relationships. Connect related data together with foreign keys. Know how we store these keys in a one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many relationship.
- With a one-to-one or one-to-many relationship, we are able to use a foreign key on the table to indicate the other specific record that it is connected to.
- With a many-to-many relationship, each record could be connected to multiple records, so we have to create a join table to connect these entities. A record on this join table connects a record from one table to a record from another table.

**How to use transactions to group multiple SQL commands into one succeed or fail operation**

- We can define an explicit transaction using BEGIN and ending with either COMMIT or ROLLBACK.
- If any command inside the block fails, everything will be rolled back. We can also specify that we want to roll back at the end of the block instead of committing. We saw that this can be useful when analyzing operations that would manipulate our database.

```
BEGIN;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance --- 100.00
WHERE name = 'Alice';
UPDATE branches SET balance = balance --- 100.00
WHERE name = (SELECT branch_name FROM accounts WHERE name = 'Alice');
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100.00
WHERE name = 'Bob';
UPDATE branches SET balance = balance + 100.00
WHERE name = (SELECT branch_name FROM accounts WHERE name = 'Bob');
COMMIT;

BEGIN;
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
UPDATE cities
SET city = 'New York City'
WHERE city = 'New York';
ROLLBACK;

```

**How to apply indexes to tables to improve performance**

- An index can help optimize queries that we have to run regularly. If we are constantly looking up records in a table by a particular field (such as username or phone number), we can add an index in order to speed up this process.
- An index maintains a sorted version of the field with a reference to the record that it points to in the table (via primary key). If we want to find a record based on a field that we have an index for, we can look through this index in a more efficient manner than having to scan through the entire table (generally O(log n) since the index is sorted, instead of O(n) for a sequential scan).
- To add an index to a field we can use the following syntax:

```
CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name (column_name);

```

- To drop an index we can do the following:

```
DROP INDEX index_name

```

- Making an index is not always the best approach. Indices allow for faster lookup, but slow down record insertion and the updating of associated fields, since we not only have to add the information to the table, but also manipulate the index.
- We generally wouldn t care about adding an index if:
- The tables are small
- We are updating the table frequently, especially the associated columns
- The column has many NULL values

**Explain what the EXPLAIN command is used for:**

- EXPLAIN gives us information about how a query will run (the query plan)
- It gives us an idea of how our database will search for data as well as a qualitative comparitor for how expensive that operation will be. Comparing the cost of two queries will tell us which one is more efficient (lower cost).
- We can also use the ANALYZE command with EXPLAIN, which will actually run the specified query. Doing so gives us more detailed information, such as the milliseconds it took our query to execute as well as specifics like the exact number of rows filtered and returned.

1.  Demonstrate how to install and use the node-postgres library and its Pool class to query a PostgreSQL-managed database

- We can add the node-postgres library to our application with npm install pg. From there we will typically use the Pool class associated with this library. That way we can run many SQL queries with one database connection (as opposed to Client, which closes the connection after a query).

```
const { Pool } = require('pg');

```

// If we need to specify a username, password, or database, we can do so when we create a Pool instance, otherwise the default values for logging in to psql are used:

```
const pool = new Pool({ username: '<<username>>', password: '<<password>>', database: '<<database>>'})

```

- The query method on the Pool instance will allow us to execute a SQL query on our database. We can pass in a string that represents the query we want to run

```
const allAirportsSql = `
SELECT id, city_id, faa_id, name
FROM airports;
`;

async function selectAllAirports() {
const results = await pool.query(allAirportsSql);
console.log(results.rows);
pool.end(); // invoking end() will close our connection to the database
}

```

selectAllAirports();

- The return value of this asynchronous function is an object with a rows key that points to an array of objects, each object representing a record with field names as keys.

**Explain how to write prepared statements with placeholders for parameters of the form $1 , $2 , and so on**

- The prepared statement (SQL string that we wrote) can also be made more dynamic by allowing for parameters to be passed in.
- The Pool instance s query function allows us to pass a second argument, an array of parameters to be used in the query string. The location of the parameter substitutions are designated with $1, $2, etc., to signify the first, second, etc., arguments.

```
const airportsByNameSql = `
SELECT name, faa_id
FROM airports
WHERE UPPER(name) LIKE UPPER($1)
`;

```

async function selectAirportsByName(name) {\
const results = await pool.query(airportsByNameSql, [ `%${name}%` ]);\
console.log(results.rows);\
pool.end(); // invoking end() will close our connection to the database\
}

```
// Get the airport name from the command line and store it
// in the variable "name". Pass that value to the
// selectAirportsByName function.
const name = process.argv[2];
// console.log(name);
selectAirportsByName(name);

```

**ORM**

1.  How to install, configure, and use Sequelize, an ORM for JavaScript

- To start a new project we use our standard npm initialize statement
- npm init -y
- Add in the packages we will need (sequelize, sequelize-cli, and pg)
- npm install sequelize@⁵.0.0 sequelize-cli@⁵.0.0 pg@⁸.0.0
- Initialize sequelize in our project
- npx sequelize-cli init
- Create a database user with credentials we will use for the project
- psql
- CREATE USER example_user WITH PASSWORD 'badpassword'
- Here we can also create databases since we are already in postgres

```
CREATE DATABASE example_app_development WITH OWNER example_user

CREATE DATABASE example_app_test WITH OWNER example_user

CREATE DATABASE example_app_production WITH OWNER example_user

```

- If we don t create these databases now, we could also create them after we make our changes to our config file. If we take this approach, we need to make sure our user that we created has the CREATEDB option when we make them, since sequelize will attempt to make the databases with this user. This other approach would look like:
- In psql: CREATE USER example_user WITH PASSWORD 'badpassword' CREATEDB
- In terminal: npx sequelize-cli db:create
- Double check that our configuration file matches our username, password, database, dialect, and seederStorage (these will be filled out for you in an assessment scenario):

```
{
"development": {
"username": "sequelize_recipe_box_app",
"password": "HfKfK79k",
"database": "recipe_box_development",
"host": "127.0.0.1",
"dialect": "postgres",
"seederStorage": "sequelize"
},
"test": {
"username": "sequelize_recipe_box_app",
"password": "HfKfK79k",
"database": "recipe_box_test",
"host": "127.0.0.1",
"dialect": "postgres",
"seederStorage": "sequelize"
},
"production": {
"username": "sequelize_recipe_box_app",
"password": "HfKfK79k",
"database": "recipe_box_production",
"host": "127.0.0.1",
"dialect": "postgres",
"seederStorage": "sequelize"
}
}

```

1.  How to use database migrations to make your database grow with your application in a source-control enabled way

**Migrations**

- In order to make new database tables and sequelize models that reflect them, we want to generate a migration file and model file using model:generate

```
npx sequelize-cli model:generate --- name Cat --- attributes "firstName:string,specialSkill:string"

```

- Here we are creating a migration file and a model file for a Cat. We are specifying that we want this table to have fields for firstName and specialSkill. Sequelize will automatically make fields for an id, createdAt, and updatedAt, as well, so we do not need to specify these.
- Once our migration file is created, we can go in and edit any details that we need to. Most often we will want to add in database constraints such as allowNull: false, adding a uniqueness constraint with unique: true, adding in character limits to fields such as type: Sequelize.STRING(100), or specifying a foreign key with references to another table references: { model: 'Categories' }.
- After we make any necessary changes to our migration file, we need to perform the migration, which will run the SQL commands to actually create the table.

```
npx sequelize-cli db:migrate

```

- This command runs any migration files that have not been previously run, in the order that they were created (this is why the timestamp in the file name is important)
- If we realize that we made a mistake after migrating, we can undo our previous migration, or all of our migrations. After undoing them, we can make any changes necessary to our migration files (They won t be deleted from the undo, so we don t need to generate anything! Just make the necessary changes to the files that already exist and save the files.). Running the migrations again will make the tables with the updates reflected.

```
npx sequelize-cli db:migrate:undo

npx sequelize-cli db:migrate:undo:all

```

**Models Validations and Associations**

- In addition to the migration files, our model:generate command also created a model file for us. This file is what allows sequelize to transform the results of its SQL queries into useful JavaScript objects for us.
- The model is where we can specify a validation that we want to perform before trying to run a SQL query. If the validation fails, we can respond with a message instead of running the query, which can be an expensive operation that we know won t work.

```
// Before we make changes, sequelize generates the type that this field represents specification:
DataTypes.TEXT
// We can replace the generated format with an object to specify not only the type, but the validations that we want to implement. The validations can also take in messages the respond with on failure and arguments.
specification: {
    type: DataTypes.TEXT,
    validate: {
        notEmpty: {
            msg: 'The specification cannot be empty'
        },
        len: {
            args: [10, 100]
            msg: 'The specifcation must be between 10 and 100 characters'
        }
    }
}

```

- Another key part of the model file is setting up our associations. We can use the belongsTo, hasMany, and belongsToMany methods to set up model-level associations. Doing so is what creates the helpful functionality like addOwner that we saw in the pets example, a function that automatically generates the SQL necessary to create a petOwner record and supplies the appropriate petId and ownerId.
- In a one-to-many association, we need to have a belongsTo association on the many side, and a hasMany association on the one side:
- Instruction.belongsTo(models.Recipe, { foreignKey: 'recipeId' });
- Recipe.hasMany(models.Instruction, { foreignKey: 'recipeId' });
- In a many-to-many association, we need to have a belongsToMany on each side of the association. We generally specify a columnMapping object to show the association more clearly:

```
// In our Owner model

// To connect this Owner to a Pet through the PetOwner

const columnMapping = {

through: 'PetOwner',

// joins table

otherKey: 'petId',

// key that connects to other table we have a many association with foreignKey: 'ownerId'

// our foreign key in the joins table

}

Owner.belongsToMany( models.Pet, columnMapping );

// In our Pet model

// To connect this Pet to an Owner through the PetOwner

const columnMapping = { through: 'PetOwner',

// joins table

otherKey: 'ownerId',

// key that connects to other table we have a many association with

foreignKey: 'petId'

// our foreign key in the joins table

}

Pet.belongsToMany( models.Owner, columnMapping );

```

### **How to perform CRUD operations with Sequelize**

- Seed Files
- Seed files can be used to populate our database with starter data.
- npx sequelize-cli seed:generate --- name add-cats
- up indicates what to create when we seed our database, down indicates what to delete if we want to unseed the database.
- For our up, we use the queryInterface.bulkInsert() method, which takes in the name of the table to seed and an array of objects representing the records we want to create:

```
up: (queryInterface, Sequelize) => {
    return queryInterface.bulkInsert('<<TableName>>', [{
        field1: value1a,
        field2: value2a
    }, {
        field1: value1b,
        field2: value2b
    }, {
        field1: value1c,
        field2: value2c
    }]);
}

```

- For our down, we use the queryInterface.bulkDelete() method, which takes in the name of the table and an object representing our WHERE clause. Unseeding will delete all records from the specified table that match the WHERE clause.

```
// If we want to specify what to remove:
down: (queryInterface, Sequelize) => {
return queryInterface.bulkDelete('<<TableName>>', {
field1: [value1a, value1b, value1c], //...etc.
});
};
// If we want to remove everything from the table:
down: (queryInterface, Sequelize) => {
return queryInterface.bulkDelete('<<TableName>>', null, {});
};

```

- Running npx sequelize-cli db:seed:all will run all of our seeder files.
- npx sequelize-cli db:seed:undo:all will undo all of our seeding.
- If we omit the :all we can run specific seed files
- Inserting with Build and Create
- In addition to seed files, which we generally use for starter data, we can create new records in our database by using build and save, or the combined create
- Use the .build method of the Cat model to create a new Cat instance in index.js

```
// Constructs an instance of the JavaScript `Cat` class. **Does not
// save anything to the database yet**. Attributes are passed in as a
// POJO.
const newCat = Cat.build({
    firstName: 'Markov',
    specialSkill: 'sleeping',
    age: 5
});
// This actually creates a new `Cats` record in the database. We must
// wait for this asynchronous operation to succeed.
await newCat.save();
// This builds and saves all in one step. If we don't need to perform any operations on the instance before saving it, this can optimize our code.
const newerCat = await Cat.create({
    firstName: 'Whiskers',
    specialSkill: 'sleeping',
    age: 2
})

```

**Updating Records**

- When we have a reference to an instance of a model (i.e. after we have queried for it or created it), we can update values by simply reassigning those fields and using the save method

**Deleting Records**

- When we have a reference to an instance of a model, we can delete that record by using destroy
- const cat = await Cat.findByPk(1); // Remove the Markov record. await cat.destroy();
- We can also call destroy on the model itself. By passing in an object that specifies a where clause, we can destroy all records that match that query
- await Cat.destroy({ where: { specialSkill: 'jumping' } });

**How to query using Sequelize**

**findAll**

```
const cats = await Cat.findAll();
// Log the fetched cats.
// The extra arguments to stringify are a replacer and a space respectively
// Here we're specifying a space of 2 in order to print more legibly
// We don't want a replacer, so we pass null just so that we can pass a 3rd argument
console.log(JSON.stringify(cats, null, 2));

```

**WHERE clause**

- Passing an object to findAll can add on clauses to our query
- The where key takes an object as a value to indicate what we are filtering by
- { where: { field: value } } => WHERE field = value

```
const cats = await Cat.findAll({ where: { firstName: "Markov" } }); console.log(JSON.stringify(cats, null, 2));

```

**OR in the WHERE clause**

- Using an array for the value tells sequelize we want to match any of these values

{ where: { field: [value1, value2] } => WHERE field IN (value1, value2)

```
const cats = await Cat.findAll({ where: { firstName: ["Markov", "Curie"] } });const cats = await Cat.findAll({
    where: {
        firstName: "Markov",
        age: 4
    }
});
console.log(JSON.stringify(cats, null, 2));

console.log(JSON.stringify(cats, null, 2));

```

**AND in the WHERE clause**

- Providing additional key/value pairs to the where object indicates all filters must match
- { where: { field1: value1, field2: value2 } } => WHERE field1 = value1 AND field2 = value2

### Sequelize Op operator

- By requiring Op from the sequelize library we can provide more advanced comparison operators
- const { Op } = require("sequelize");
- Op.ne: Not equal operator

```
const cats = await Cat.findAll({
    where: {
        firstName: {
            // All cats where the name is not equal to "Markov"
            // We use brackets in order to evaluate Op.ne and use the value as the key
            [Op.ne]: "Markov"
        },
    },
});
console.log(JSON.stringify(cats, null, 2));

```

### Op.and: and operator

```
const cats = await Cat.findAll({
    where: {
        // The array that Op.and points to must all be true
        // Here, we find cats where the name is not "Markov" and the age is 4
        [Op.and]: [{
            firstName: {
                [Op.ne]: "Markov"
            }
        }, {
            age: 4
        }, ],
    },
});
console.log(JSON.stringify(cats, null, 2));

```

### Op.or: or operator

```
const cats = await Cat.findAll({
    where: {
        // One condition in the array that Op.or points to must be true
        // Here, we find cats where the name is "Markov" or where the age is 4
        [Op.or]: [{
            firstName: "Markov"
        }, {
            age: 4
        }, ],
    },
});
console.log(JSON.stringify(cats, null, 2));

```

Op.gt and Op.lt: greater than and less than operators

const cats = await Cat.findAll({ where: { // Find all cats where the age is greater than 4 age: { [Op.gt]: 4 }, } }, }); console.log(JSON.stringify(cats, null, 2));

#### Ordering results

- Just like the where clause, we can pass an order key to specify we want our results ordered
- The key order points to an array with the fields that we want to order by
- By default, the order is ascending, just like standard SQL. If we want to specify descending, we can instead use a nested array with the field name as the first element and DESC as the second element. (We could also specify ASC as a second element in a nested array, but it is unnecessary as it is default)
- const cats = await Cat.findAll({ // Order by age descending, then by firstName ascending if cats have the same age order: [["age", "DESC"], "firstName"], }); console.log(JSON.stringify(cats, null, 2));

```
// Get a reference to the cat record that we want to update (here just the cat with primary key of 1)
const cat = await Cat.findByPk(1);
// Change cat's attributes.
cat.firstName = "Curie";
cat.specialSkill = "jumping";
cat.age = 123;
// Save the new name to the database.
await cat.save();

```

- Limiting results
- We can provide a limit key in order to limit our results to a specified number

```
const cats = await Cat.findAll({
    order: [
        ["age", "DESC"]
    ],
    // Here we are limiting our results to one record. It will still return an array, just with one object inside. We could have said any number here, the result is always an array.
    limit: 1,
});
console.log(JSON.stringify(cats, null, 2));

```

### findOne

- If we only want one record to be returned we can use findOne instead of findAll
- If multiple records would have matched our findOne query, it will return the first record
- Unlike findAll, findOne will return the object directly instead of an array. If no records matched the query it will return null.

```
// finds the oldest cat const cat = await Cat.findOne({ order: [["age", "DESC"]], }); console.log(JSON.stringify(cat, null, 2));

```

- **Querying with Associations**

We can include associated data by adding an include key to our options object

```
const pet = Pet.findByPk(1, {
    include: [PetType, Owner]
});
console.log(pet.id, pet.name, pet.age, pet.petTypeId, pet.PetType.type, pet.Owners

```

We can get nested associations by having include point to an object that specifies which model we have an association with, then chaining an association on with another include

**How to perform data validations with Sequelize**

- See the database migrations section above.
- In general, we add in a validate key to each field that we want validations for. This key points to an object that specifies all of the validations we want to make on that field, such as notEmpty, notNull, len, isIn, etc.

```
specification: {
    type: DataTypes.TEXT,
    validate: {
        notEmpty: {
            msg: 'The specification cannot be empty'
        },
        len: {
            args: [10, 100]
            msg: 'The specifcation must be between 10 and 100 characters'
        }
    }
}

```

**How to use transactions with Sequelize**

- We can create a transaction block in order to make sure either all operations are performed or none of them are
- We use the .transaction method in order to create our block. The method takes in a callback with an argument to track our transaction id (typically just a simple tx variable).
- All of our sequelize operations can be passed a transaction key on their options argument which points to our transaction id. This indicates that this operation is part of the transaction block and should only be executed in the database when the whole block executes without error.

```
async function main() {
    try {
        // Do all database access within the transaction.
        await sequelize.transaction(async (tx) => {
            // Fetch Markov and Curie's accounts.
            const markovAccount = await BankAccount.findByPk(
                1, {
                    transaction: tx
                },
            );
            const curieAccount = await BankAccount.findByPk(
                2, {
                    transaction: tx
                }
            );
            // No one can mess with Markov or Curie's accounts until the
            // transaction completes! The account data has been locked!
            // Increment Curie's balance by $5,000.
            curieAccount.balance += 5000;
            await curieAccount.save({
                transaction: tx
            });
            // Decrement Markov's balance by $5,000.
            markovAccount.balance -= 5000;
            await markovAccount.save({
                transaction: tx
            });
        });
    } catch (err) {
        // Report if anything goes wrong.
        console.log("Error!");
        for (const e of err.errors) {
            console.log(
                `${e.instance.clientName}: ${e.message}`
            );
        }
    }
    await sequelize.close();
}
main();

```

```

#### Migrations

### Create Table (usually used in the up() method)

```
// This uses the short form for references
return queryInterface.createTable(<TableName>, {
    <columnName>: {
        type: Sequelize.<type>,
        allowNull: <true|false>,
        unique: <true|false>,
        references: { model: <TableName> }, // This is the plural table name
                                            // that the column references.
    }
});
// This the longer form for references that is less confusing
return queryInterface.createTable(<TableName>, {
    <columnName>: {
        type: Sequelize.<type>,
        allowNull: <true|false>,
        unique: <true|false>,
        references: {
            model: {
                tableName: <TableName> // This is the plural table name
            }
        }
    }
});

```

### Delete Table (usually used in the down() function)

```
return queryInterface.dropTable(<TableName>);

```

### Adding a column

```
return queryInteface.addColumn(<TableName>, <columnName>: {
    type: Sequelize.<type>,
    allowNull: <true|false>,
    unique: <true|false>,
    references: { model: <TableName> }, // This is the plural table name
                                        // that the column references.
});

```

### Removing a column

```
return queryInterface.removeColumn(<TableName>, <columnName>);

```

### Model Associations

### One to One between Student and Scholarship

`student.js`

```
Student.hasOne(models.Scholarship, { foreignKey: 'studentId' });

```

`scholarship.js`

```
Scholarship.belongsTo(models.Student, { foreignKey: 'studentId' });

```

### One to Many between Student and Class

`student.js`

```
Student.belongsTo(models.Class, { foreignKey: 'classId' });

```

`class.js`

```
Class.hasMany(models.Student, { foreignKey: 'classId' });

```

### Many to Many between Student and Lesson through StudentLessons table

`student.js`

```
const columnMapping = {
    through: 'StudentLesson', // This is the model name referencing the join table.
    otherKey: 'lessonId',
    foreignKey: 'studentId'
}
Student.belongsToMany(models.Lesson, columnMapping);

```

`lesson.js`

```
const columnMapping = {
    through: 'StudentLesson', // This is the model name referencing the join table.
    otherKey: 'studentId',
    foreignKey: 'lessonId'
}
Lesson.belongsToMany(models.Student, columnMapping);

```

### Inserting a new item

```
// Way 1 - With build and save
const pet = Pet.build({
    name: "Fido",
    petTypeId: 1
});
await pet.save();
// Way 2 - With create
const pet = await Pet.create({
    name: "Fido",
    petTypeId: 1
});

```

### Updating an item

```
// Find the pet with id = 1
const pet = await Pet.findByPk(1);
// Way 1
pet.name = "Fido, Sr."
await pet.save;
// Way 2
await pet.update({
    name: "Fido, Sr."
});

```

### Deleting a single item

```
// Find the pet with id = 1
const pet = await Pet.findByPk(1);
// Notice this is an instance method
pet.destroy();

```

### Deleting multiple items

```
// Notice this is a static class method
await Pet.destroy({
    where: {
        petTypeId: 1 // Destorys all the pets where the petType is 1
    }
});

```

### Query Format

### findOne

```
await <Model>.findOne({
    where: {
        <column>: {
            [Op.<operator>]: <value>
        }
    },
});

```

### findAll

```
await <Model>.findAll({
    where: {
        <column>: {
            [Op.<operator>]: <value>
        }
    },
    include: <include_specifier>,
    offset: 10,
    limit: 2
});

```

### findByPk

```
await <Model>.findByPk(<primary_key>, {
    include: <include_specifier>
});

```

### Eager loading associations with `include`

Simple include of one related model.

```
await Pet.findByPk(1,  {
        include: PetType
    })

```

Include can take an array of models if you need to include more than one.

```
await Pet.findByPk(1, {
        include: [Pet, Owner]
    })

```

Include can also take an object with keys `model` and `include`.\
This is in case you have nested associations.\
In this case Owner doesn't have an association with PetType, but\
Pet does, so we want to include PetType onto the Pet Model.

```
await Owner.findByPk(1, {
        include: {
            model: Pet
            include: PetType
        }
    });

```

### toJSON method

The confusingly named toJSON() method does **not** return a JSON string but instead\
returns a POJO for the instance.

```
// pet is an instance of the Pet class
const pet = await Pet.findByPk(1);
console.log(pet) // prints a giant object with
                 // tons of properties and methods
// petPOJO is now just a plain old Javascript Object
const petPOJO = pet.toJSON();
console.log(petPOJO); // { name: "Fido", petTypeId: 1 }

```

### Common Where Operators

```
const Op = Sequelize.Op
[Op.and]: [{a: 5}, {b: 6}] // (a = 5) AND (b = 6)
[Op.or]: [{a: 5}, {a: 6}]  // (a = 5 OR a = 6)
[Op.gt]: 6,                // > 6
[Op.gte]: 6,               // >= 6
[Op.lt]: 10,               // < 10
[Op.lte]: 10,              // <= 10
[Op.ne]: 20,               // != 20
[Op.eq]: 3,                // = 3

### Accessing the Data

You can access and query the data using the `findByPk`, `findOne`, and `findAll` methods. First, make sure you import the models in your JavaScript file. In this case, we are assuming your JavaScript file is in the root of your project and so is the models folder.

```
const { Recipe, Ingredient, Instruction, MeasurementUnit } = require('./models');

```

The models folder exports each of the models that you have created. We have these four in our data model, so we will destructure the models to access each table individually. The associations that you have defined in each of your models will allow you to access data of related tables when you query your database using the `include` option.

If you want to find all recipes, for the recipe list, you would use the `findAll` method. You need to await this, so make sure your function is async.

```
async function findAllRecipes() {

return await Recipe.findAll();

}

```

If you would like to include all the ingredients so you can create a shopping list for all the recipes, you would use `include`. This is possible because of the association you have defined in your Recipe and Ingredient models.

```
async function getShoppingList() {

return await Recipe.findAll({ include: [ Ingredient ] });

}

```

If you only want to find one where there is chicken in the ingredients list, you would use `findOne` and `findByPk`.

```
async function findAChickenRecipe() {

const chickenRecipe = await Ingredient.findOne({

where: {

foodStuff: 'chicken'

}

});

return await Recipe.findByPk(chickenRecipe.recipeId);

}

```

### Data Access to Create/Update/Delete Rows

You have two options when you want to create a row in a table (where you are saving one record into the table). You can either `.build` the row and then `.save` it, or you can `.create` it. Either way it does the same thing. Here are some examples:

Let's say we have a form that accepts the name of the recipe (for simplicity). When we get the results of the form, we can:

```
const newRecipe = await Recipe.build({ title: 'Chicken Noodle Soup' });

await newRecipe.save();

```

This just created our new recipe and added it to our Recipes table. You can do the same thing like this:

```
await Recipe.create({ title: 'Chicken Noodle Soup' });

```

If you want to modify an item in your table, you can use `update`. Let's say we want to change the chicken noodle soup to chicken noodle soup with extra veggies, first we need to get the recipe, then we can update it.

```
const modRecipe = await Recipe.findOne({ where: { title: 'Chicken Noodle Soup' } });

await modRecipe.update({ title: 'Chicken Noodle Soup with Extra Veggies' });

```

To delete an item from your table, you will do the same kind of process. Find the recipe you want to delete and `destroy` it, like this:

```
const deleteThis = await Recipe.findOne({ where: { title: 'Chicken Noodle Soup with Extra Veggies' } });

await deleteThis.destroy();

```

**NOTE:** If you do not await these, you will receive a promise, so you will need to use `.then` and `.catch` to do more with the items you are accessing and modifying.

### Documentation

For the data types and validations in your models, here are the official docs. The sequelize docs are hard to look at, so these are the specific sections with just the lists:\
**Sequelize Data Types:** [](https://sequelize.org/v5/manual/data-types.html)_<https://sequelize.org/v5/manual/data-types.html>_\
**Validations:** [](https://sequelize.org/v5/manual/models-definition.html#validations)_<https://sequelize.org/v5/manual/models-definition.html#validations>_\
When you access the data in your queries, here are the operators available, again because the docs are hard to navigate, this is the specific section with the list of operators.\
**Operators:** [](https://sequelize.org/v5/manual/querying.html#operators)_<https://sequelize.org/v5/manual/querying.html#operators>_\
The documentation for building, saving, creating, updating and destroying is linked here, it does a pretty good job of explaining in my opinion, it just has a title that we have not been using in this course. When they talk about an instance, they mean an item stored in your table.\
**Create/Update/Destroy:** [](https://sequelize.org/v5/manual/instances.html)_<https://sequelize.org/v5/manual/instances.html>_

- **­­­­If you were to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?**

Semantic HTML is markup that conveys meaning, not appearance, to search engines to make everything easier to identify.

- **Name two big differences between display: block; and display: inline;.**

block starts on a new line and takes up the full width of the content.\
 inline starts on the same line as previous content, in line with other content, and takes up only the space needed for the content.

- **What are the 4 areas of the box model?**

content, padding, border, margin

- **While using flexbox, what axis does the following property work on: align-items: center?**

cross-axis

- **Explain why git is valuable to a team of developers.**

Allows you to dole out tiny pieces of a large project to many developers who can all work towards the same goal on their own chunks, allows roll back if you make a mistake; version control.

- **What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?**

An adaptive website "adapts" to fit a pre-determined set of screen sizes/devices, and a responsive one changes to fit all devices.

- **Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.**

It means you develop/code the site with mobile in mind first and work your way outward in screen size.

- **What does font-size: 62.5% in the html tag do for us when using rem units?**

This setting makes it so that 1 rem = 10 px for font size, easier to calculate.

- **How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?**

Preprocessing is basically a bunch of functions and variables you can use to store CSS settings in different ways that make it easier to code CSS.

- **What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?**

Favorite is (parametric) mixins; but I don't have a lot of trouble with preprocessing. What gives me the most trouble is knowing ahead of time what would be good to go in a mixin for a given site.

- **Describe the biggest difference between .forEach & .map.**

forEach iterates over an array item by item, and map calls a function on each array item, but returns another/additional array, unlike forEach.

- **What is the difference between a function and a method?**

Every function is an object. If a value is a function, it is a method. Methods have to be 'received' by something; functions do not.

- **What is closure?**

It is code identified elsewhere that we can use later; gives the ability to put functions together. If a variable isn't defined, a function looks outward for context.

- **Describe the four rules of the 'this' keyword.**

1.  Window/global binding --- this is the window/console object. 'use strict'; to prevent window binding.

2.  Implicit binding --- when a function is called by a dot, the object preceding the dot is the 'this'. 80 percent of 'this' is from this type of binding.

3.  New binding --- points to new object created & returned by constructor function

4.  Explicit binding --- whenever call, bind, or apply are used.

- **Why do we need super() in an extended class?**

Super ties the parent to the child.

- **What is the DOM?**

Document object model, the 'window' or container that holds all the page's elements

- **What is an event?**

An event is something happening on or to the page, like a mouse click, doubleclick, key up/down, pointer out of element/over element, things like this. There are tons of "events" that javascript can detect.

- **What is an event listener?**

Javascript command that 'listens' for an event to happen on the page to a given element and then runs a function when that event happens

- **Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?**

A NodeList isn't a real array, so it won't have access to array methods such as slice or map.

- **What is a component?**

Reusable pieces of code to display info in a consistent repeatable way

- **What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve? Support your answer with concepts introduced in class and from your personal research on the web.**

ReactJS is a library used to build large applications. It's very good at assisting developers in manipulating the DOM element to create rich user experiences. We need a way to off-load the state/data that our apps use, and React helps us do that.

- **What does it mean to *think* in react?**

It makes you think about how to organize/build apps a little differently because it's very scalable and allows you to build huge apps. React's one-way data flow makes everything modular and fast. You can build apps top-down or bottom-up.

- **Describe state.**

Some data we want to display.

- **Describe props.**

Props are like function arguments in JS and attributes in HTML.

- **What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component to state or prop changes?**

Side effects are anything that affects something outside the executed function's scope like fetching data from an API, a timer, or logging.

- **Explain benefit(s) using client-side routing?**

Answer: It's much more efficient than the traditional way, because a lot of data isn't being transmitted unnecessarily.

- **Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?**

Because some companies still use class components and don't want to switch their millions of dollars' worth of code over to all functional hooks, and also there's currently a lot more troubleshooting content out there for classes that isn't out there for hooks. Also, functional components are better when you don't need state, presentational components.

- **Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.**

componentDidMount = do the stuff inside this 'function' after the component mounted

componentDidUpdate = do the stuff inside this function after the component updated

componentWillUnmount = clean-up in death/unmounting phase

- **What is the purpose of a custom hook?**

allow you to apply non-visual behavior and stateful logic throughout your components by reusing the same hook over and over again

- **Why is it important to test our apps?**

Gets bugs fixed faster, reduces regression risk, makes you consider/work out the edge cases, acts as documentation, acts as safety net when refactoring, makes code more trustworthy

- **What problem does the context API help solve?**

You can store data in a context object instead of prop drilling.

- **In your own words, describe actions, reducers and the store and their role in Redux. What does each piece do? Why is the store known as a 'single source of truth' in a redux application?**

Everything that changes within your app is represented by a single JS object called the store. The store contains state for our application. When changes are made to our application state, we never write to our store object but rather clone the state object, modify the clone, and replace the original state with the new copy, never mutating the original object. Reducers are the only place we can update our state. Actions tell our reducers "how" to update the state, and perhaps with what data it should be updated, but only a reducer can actually update the state.

- **What is the difference between Application state and Component state? When would be a good time to use one over the other?**

App state is global, component state is local. Use component state when you have component-specific variables.

- **Describe redux-thunk, what does it allow us to do? How does it change our action-creators?**

Redux Thunk is middleware that provides the ability to handle asynchronous operations inside our Action Creators, because reducers are normally synchronous.

- **What is your favorite state management system you've learned and this sprint? Please explain why!**

Redux, because I felt it was easier to understand than the context API.

- **Explain what a token is used for.**

Many services out in the wild require the client (our React app, for example) to provide proof that it's authenticated with them. The server running these services can issue a JWT (JSON Web Token) as the authentication token, in exchange for correct login credentials.

- **What steps can you take in your web apps to keep your data secure?**

As we build our web apps, we will most likely have some "protected" routes --- routes that we only want to render if the user has logged in and been authenticated by our server. The way this normally works is we make a login request, sending the server the user's username and password. The server will check those credentials against what is in the database, and if it can authenticate the user, it will return a token. Once we have this token, we can add two layers of protection to our app. One with protected routes, the other by sending an authentication header with our API calls (as we learned in the above objective).

- **Describe how web servers work.**

The "world wide web" (which we'll refer to as "the web") is just a part of the internet --- which is itself a network of interconnected computers. The web is just one way to share data over the internet. It consists of a body of information stored on web servers, ready to be shared across the world. The term "web server" can mean two things:

- a computer that stores the code for a website

- a program that runs on such a computer

The physical computer device that we call a web server is connected to the internet, and stores the code for different websites to be shared across the world at all times. When we load the code for our websites, or web apps, on a server like this, we would say that the server is "hosting" our website/app.

- **Which HTTP methods can be mapped to the CRUD acronym that we use when interfacing with APIs/Servers.**

Create, Read, Update, Delete

- **Mention two parts of Express that you learned about this week.**

Routing/router, Middleware, convenience helpers

- **Describe Middleware?**

array of functions that get executed in the order they are introduced into the server code

- **Describe a Resource?**

o everything is a **resource**.

o each resource is accessible via a **unique URI**.

o resources can have multiple **representations**.

o communication is done over a **stateless** protocol (HTTP).

o management of resources is done via **HTTP methods**.

- **What can the API return to help clients know if a request was successful?**

200 status code/201 status code

- **How can we partition our application into sub-applications?**

By dividing the code up into multiple files and 'requiring' them in the main server file.

- **Explain the difference between Relational Databases and SQL.**

SQL is the language used to access a relational database.

- **Why do tables need a primary key?**

To uniquely identify each record/row.

- **What is the name given to a table column that references the primary key on another table.**

Foreign key

- **What do we need in order to have a *many to many* relationship between two tables.**

An **intermediary table** that holds foreign keys that reference the primary key on the related tables.

- **What is the purpose of using *sessions*?**

The purpose is to persist data across requests.

- **What does bcrypt do to help us store passwords in a secure manner?**

o password hashing function.

o implements salting both manual and automatically.

o accumulative hashing rounds.

- **What does bcrypt do to slow down attackers?**

Having an algorithm that hashes the information multiple times (rounds) means an attacker needs to have the hash, know the algorithm used, and how many rounds were used to generate the hash in the first place. So it basically makes it a lot more difficult to get somebody's password.

- **What are the three parts of the JSON Web Token?**

Header, payload, signature

### Fundamental Concepts In React That Will Probably Come Up On An Interview

#### Incomplete Article

**Explain how React uses a tree data structure called the "virtual DOM" to model the DOM**

> ↠The Virtual DOM is an in-memory tree representation of the browser's Document Object Model. React's philosophy is to interact with the Virtual DOM instead of the regular DOM for developer ease and performance.

> ↠By abstracting the key concepts from the DOM, React is able to expose additional tooling and functionality increasing developer ease.

> ↠By trading off the additional memory requirements of the Virtual DOM, React is able to optimize for efficient subtree comparisons, resulting in fewer, simpler updates to the less efficient DOM. The result of these tradeoffs is improved performance.

### **Describe how JSX transforms into React.createElement calls:**

#### ↠JSX is a special format to let you construct virtual DOM nodes using familiar HTML-like syntax. You can put the JSX directly into your .js files, however you must run the JSX through a pre-compiler like [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) in order for the browser to understand it.

#### ↠ReactDOM.render is a simple function which accepts 2 arguments: what to render and where to render it:

### Linked Lists

In the university setting, it's common for Linked Lists to appear early on in an undergraduate's Computer Science coursework. While they don't always have the most practical real-world applications in industry, Linked Lists make for an important and effective educational tool in helping develop a student's mental model on what data structures actually are to begin with.

Linked lists are simple. They have many compelling, reoccurring edge cases to consider that emphasize to the student the need for care and intent while implementing data structures. They can be applied as the underlying data structure while implementing a variety of other prevalent abstract data types, such as Lists, Stacks, and Queues, and they have a level of versatility high enough to clearly illustrate the value of the Object Oriented Programming paradigm.

They also come up in software engineering interviews quite often.

### What is a Linked List?

A Linked List data structure represents a linear sequence of "vertices" (or "nodes"), and tracks three important properties.

**Linked List Properties:**

[![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/44c934273bd8a64c8153959678d4ea2f2b48a19e608bbee943c8fa3bae5d0423/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f3830302f312a7a2d693177453651504f7471784769575f42365775412e706e67)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/44c934273bd8a64c8153959678d4ea2f2b48a19e608bbee943c8fa3bae5d0423/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f3830302f312a7a2d693177453651504f7471784769575f42365775412e706e67)

The data being tracked by a particular Linked List does not live inside the Linked List instance itself. Instead, each vertex is actually an instance of an even simpler, smaller data structure, often referred to as a "Node".

Depending on the type of Linked List (there are many), Node instances track some very important properties as well.

**Linked List Node Properties:**

[![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/3eac7ff3ff617bcb42f77559313baff896c27ab9948cc6897ab5fdf829ebe5eb/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f3830302f312a7661674d427335517577763862387476463457364f672e706e67)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/3eac7ff3ff617bcb42f77559313baff896c27ab9948cc6897ab5fdf829ebe5eb/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f3830302f312a7661674d427335517577763862387476463457364f672e706e67)

Property Description `value`: The actual value this node represents.`next`The next node in the list (relative to this node).`previous`The previous node in the list (relative to this node).

**NOTE:** The `previous` property is for Doubly Linked Lists only!

Linked Lists contain *ordered* data, just like arrays. The first node in the list is, indeed, first. From the perspective of the very first node in the list, the *next* node is the second node. From the perspective of the second node in the list, the *previous* node is the first node, and the *next* node is the third node. And so it goes.

#### "So...this sounds a lot like an Array..."

Admittedly, this does *sound* a lot like an Array so far, and that's because Arrays and Linked Lists are both implementations of the List ADT. However, there is an incredibly important distinction to be made between Arrays and Linked Lists, and that is how they *physically store* their data. (As opposed to how they *represent* the order of their data.)

Recall that Arrays contain *contiguous* data. Each element of an array is actually stored *next to* it's neighboring element *in the actual hardware of your machine*, in a single continuous block in memory.

_An Array's contiguous data being stored in a continuous block of addresses in memory._

Unlike Arrays, Linked Lists contain *non-contiguous* data. Though Linked Lists *represent* data that is ordered linearly, that mental model is just that --- an interpretation of the *representation* of information, not reality.

In reality, in the actual hardware of your machine, whether it be in disk or in memory, a Linked List's Nodes are not stored in a single continuous block of addresses. Rather, Linked List Nodes live at randomly distributed addresses throughout your machine! The only reason we know which node comes next in the list is because we've assigned its reference to the current node's `next` pointer.

_A Singly Linked List's non-contiguous data (Nodes) being stored at randomly distributed addresses in memory._

For this reason, Linked List Nodes have *no indices*, and no *random access*. Without random access, we do not have the ability to look up an individual Linked List Node in constant time. Instead, to find a particular Node, we have to start at the very first Node and iterate through the Linked List one node at a time, checking each Node's *next* Node until we find the one we're interested in.

So when implementing a Linked List, we actually must implement both the Linked List class *and* the Node class. Since the actual data lives in the Nodes, it's simpler to implement the Node class first.

### Types of Linked Lists

There are four flavors of Linked List you should be familiar with when walking into your job interviews.

**Linked List Types:**

[![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/21fe4daf92e64b603d732003308ea9194e4bbc4f16ffded101d12d29579b1fbb/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f3830302f312a5a6f5949454a614f7050695941757174504c743879772e706e67)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/21fe4daf92e64b603d732003308ea9194e4bbc4f16ffded101d12d29579b1fbb/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f3830302f312a5a6f5949454a614f7050695941757174504c743879772e706e67)

**_Note:_** _These Linked List types are not always mutually exclusive._

For instance:

- Any type of Linked List can be implemented Circularly (e.g. A Circular Doubly Linked List).
- A Doubly Linked List is actually just a special case of a Multiply Linked List.

You are most likely to encounter Singly and Doubly Linked Lists in your upcoming job search, so we are going to focus exclusively on those two moving forward. However, in more senior level interviews, it is very valuable to have some familiarity with the other types of Linked Lists. Though you may not actually code them out, *you will win extra points by illustrating your ability to weigh the tradeoffs of your technical decisions* by discussing how your choice of Linked List type may affect the efficiency of the solutions you propose.

### Linked List Methods

[![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/5b0f3eb5a25e12419fc21e92f617dc804f88c5f1d269ef419719bd7cbdd262f8/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f313230302f312a39456e68705141655630335f4479455a4979695443772e706e67)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/5b0f3eb5a25e12419fc21e92f617dc804f88c5f1d269ef419719bd7cbdd262f8/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f313230302f312a39456e68705141655630335f4479455a4979695443772e706e67)

Linked Lists are great foundation builders when learning about data structures because they share a number of similar methods (and edge cases) with many other common data structures. You will find that many of the concepts discussed here will repeat themselves as we dive into some of the more complex non-linear data structures later on, like Trees and Graphs.

### Time and Space Complexity Analysis

Before we begin our analysis, here is a quick summary of the Time and Space constraints of each Linked List Operation. The complexities below apply to both Singly and Doubly Linked Lists:

[![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/4af6a97026e76288b00ffca93465dab3cd5f93ae39d92f611e1b75a8b7438b69/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f313230302f312a456e623959617152787a5338374d4c38334c6f6173772e706e67)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/4af6a97026e76288b00ffca93465dab3cd5f93ae39d92f611e1b75a8b7438b69/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f313230302f312a456e623959617152787a5338374d4c38334c6f6173772e706e67)

Before moving forward, see if you can reason to yourself why each operation has the time and space complexity listed above!

### Time Complexity --- Access and Search

#### Scenarios

1.  We have a Linked List, and we'd like to find the 8th item in the list.
2.  We have a Linked List of sorted alphabet letters, and we'd like to see if the letter "Q" is inside that list.

#### Discussion

Unlike Arrays, Linked Lists Nodes are not stored contiguously in memory, and thereby do not have an indexed set of memory addresses at which we can quickly lookup individual nodes in constant time. Instead, we must begin at the head of the list (or possibly at the tail, if we have a Doubly Linked List), and iterate through the list until we arrive at the node of interest.

In Scenario 1, we'll know we're there because we've iterated 8 times. In Scenario 2, we'll know we're there because, while iterating, we've checked each node's value and found one that matches our target value, "Q".

In the worst case scenario, we may have to traverse the entire Linked List until we arrive at the final node. This makes both Access & Search **Linear Time** operations.

### Time Complexity --- Insertion and Deletion

#### Scenarios

1.  We have an empty Linked List, and we'd like to insert our first node.
2.  We have a Linked List, and we'd like to insert or delete a node at the Head or Tail.
3.  We have a Linked List, and we'd like to insert or delete a node from somewhere in the middle of the list.

#### Discussion

Since we have our Linked List Nodes stored in a non-contiguous manner that relies on pointers to keep track of where the next and previous nodes live, Linked Lists liberate us from the linear time nature of Array insertions and deletions. We no longer have to adjust the position at which each node/element is stored after making an insertion at a particular position in the list. Instead, if we want to insert a new node at position `i`, we can simply:

1.  Create a new node.
2.  Set the new node's `next` and `previous` pointers to the nodes that live at positions `i` and `i - 1`, respectively.
3.  Adjust the `next` pointer of the node that lives at position `i - 1` to point to the new node.
4.  Adjust the `previous` pointer of the node that lives at position `i` to point to the new node.

And we're done, in Constant Time. No iterating across the entire list necessary.

"But hold on one second," you may be thinking. "In order to insert a new node in the middle of the list, don't we have to lookup its position? Doesn't that take linear time?!"

Yes, it is tempting to call insertion or deletion in the middle of a Linked List a linear time operation since there is lookup involved. However, it's usually the case that you'll already have a reference to the node where your desired insertion or deletion will occur.

For this reason, we separate the Access time complexity from the Insertion/Deletion time complexity, and formally state that Insertion and Deletion in a Linked List are **Constant Time** across the board.

**_Note:_** *Without a reference to the node at which an insertion or deletion will occur, due to linear time lookup, an insertion or deletion in the middle of a Linked List will still take Linear Time, sum total.*

### Space Complexity

#### Scenarios

1.  We're given a Linked List, and need to operate on it.
2.  We've decided to create a new Linked List as part of strategy to solve some problem.

#### Discussion

It's obvious that Linked Lists have one node for every one item in the list, and for that reason we know that Linked Lists take up Linear Space in memory. However, when asked in an interview setting what the Space Complexity *of your solution* to a problem is, it's important to recognize the difference between the two scenarios above.

In Scenario 1, we *are not* creating a new Linked List. We simply need to operate on the one given. Since we are not storing a *new* node for every node represented in the Linked List we are provided, our solution is *not necessarily* linear in space.

In Scenario 2, we *are* creating a new Linked List. If the number of nodes we create is linearly correlated to the size of our input data, we are now operating in Linear Space.

**\*Note\*\***: Linked Lists can be traversed both iteratively and recursively. If you choose to traverse a Linked List recursively, there will be a recursive function call added to the call stack for every node in the Linked List. Even if you're provided the Linked List, as in Scenario 1, you will still use Linear Space in the call stack, and that counts.\*

---

### Stacks and Queues

Stacks and Queues aren't really "data structures" by the strict definition of the term. The more appropriate terminology would be to call them abstract data types (ADTs), meaning that their definitions are more conceptual and related to the rules governing their user-facing behaviors rather than their core implementations.

For the sake of simplicity, we'll refer to them as data structures and ADTs interchangeably throughout the course, but the distinction is an important one to be familiar with as you level up as an engineer.

Now that that's out of the way, Stacks and Queues represent a linear collection of nodes or values. In this way, they are quite similar to the Linked List data structure we discussed in the previous section. In fact, you can even use a modified version of a Linked List to implement each of them. (Hint, hint.)

These two ADTs are similar to each other as well, but each obey their own special rule regarding the order with which Nodes can be added and removed from the structure.

Since we've covered Linked Lists in great length, these two data structures will be quick and easy. Let's break them down individually in the next couple of sections.

### What is a Stack?

Stacks are a Last In First Out (LIFO) data structure. The last Node added to a stack is always the first Node to be removed, and as a result, the first Node added is always the last Node removed.

The name Stack actually comes from this characteristic, as it is helpful to visualize the data structure as a vertical stack of items. Personally, I like to think of a Stack as a stack of plates, or a stack of sheets of paper. This seems to make them more approachable, because the analogy relates to something in our everyday lives.

If you can imagine adding items to, or removing items from, a Stack of...literally anything...you'll realize that every (sane) person naturally obeys the LIFO rule.

We add things to the *top* of a stack. We remove things from the *top* of a stack. We never add things to, or remove things from, the *bottom* of the stack. That's just crazy.

Note: We can use JavaScript Arrays to implement a basic stack. `Array#push` adds to the top of the stack and `Array#pop` will remove from the top of the stack. In the exercise that follows, we'll build our own Stack class from scratch (without using any arrays). In an interview setting, your evaluator may be okay with you using an array as a stack.

---

### What is a Queue?

Queues are a First In First Out (FIFO) data structure. The first Node added to the queue is always the first Node to be removed.

The name Queue comes from this characteristic, as it is helpful to visualize this data structure as a horizontal line of items with a beginning and an end. Personally, I like to think of a Queue as the line one waits on for an amusement park, at a grocery store checkout, or to see the teller at a bank.

If you can imagine a queue of humans waiting...again, for literally anything...you'll realize that *most* people (the civil ones) naturally obey the FIFO rule.

People add themselves to the *back* of a queue, wait their turn in line, and make their way toward the *front*. People exit from the *front* of a queue, but only when they have made their way to being first in line.

We never add ourselves to the front of a queue (unless there is no one else in line), otherwise we would be "cutting" the line, and other humans don't seem to appreciate that.

Note: We can use JavaScript Arrays to implement a basic queue. `Array#push` adds to the back (enqueue) and `Array#shift` will remove from the front (dequeue). In the exercise that follows, we'll build our own Queue class from scratch (without using any arrays). In an interview setting, your evaluator may be okay with you using an array as a queue.

### Stack and Queue Properties

Stacks and Queues are so similar in composition that we can discuss their properties together. They track the following three properties:

**Stack Properties | Queue Properties:**

Notice that rather than having a `head` and a `tail` like Linked Lists, Stacks have a `top`, and Queues have a `front` and a `back` instead. Stacks don't have the equivalent of a `tail` because you only ever push or pop things off the top of Stacks. These properties are essentially the same; pointers to the end points of the respective List ADT where important actions way take place. The differences in naming conventions are strictly for human comprehension.

---

Similarly to Linked Lists, the values stored inside a Stack or a Queue are actually contained within Stack Node and Queue Node instances. Stack, Queue, and Singly Linked List Nodes are all identical, but just as a reminder and for the sake of completion, these List Nodes track the following two properties:

### Time and Space Complexity Analysis

Before we begin our analysis, here is a quick summary of the Time and Space constraints of each Stack Operation.

Data Structure Operation Time Complexity (Avg)Time Complexity (Worst)Space Complexity (Worst)Access`Θ(n)O(n)O(n)`Search`Θ(n)O(n)O(n)`Insertion`Θ(1)O(1)O(n)`Deletion`Θ(1)O(1)O(n)`

Before moving forward, see if you can reason to yourself why each operation has the time and space complexity listed above!

#### Time Complexity --- Access and Search

When the Stack ADT was first conceived, its inventor definitely did not prioritize searching and accessing individual Nodes or values in the list. The same idea applies for the Queue ADT. There are certainly better data structures for speedy search and lookup, and if these operations are a priority for your use case, it would be best to choose something else!

Search and Access are both linear time operations for Stacks and Queues, and that shouldn't be too unclear. Both ADTs are nearly identical to Linked Lists in this way. The only way to find a Node somewhere in the middle of a Stack or a Queue, is to start at the `top` (or the `back`) and traverse downward (or forward) toward the `bottom` (or `front`) one node at a time via each Node's `next` property.

This is a linear time operation, O(n).

#### Time Complexity --- Insertion and Deletion

For Stacks and Queues, insertion and deletion is what it's all about. If there is one feature a Stack absolutely must have, it's constant time insertion and removal to and from the `top` of the Stack (FIFO). The same applies for Queues, but with insertion occurring at the `back` and removal occurring at the `front` (LIFO).

Think about it. When you add a plate to the top of a stack of plates, do you have to iterate through all of the other plates first to do so? Of course not. You simply add your plate to the top of the stack, and that's that. The concept is the same for removal.

Therefore, Stacks and Queues have constant time Insertion and Deletion via their `push` and `pop` or `enqueue` and `dequeue` methods, O(1).

#### Space Complexity

The space complexity of Stacks and Queues is very simple. Whether we are instantiating a new instance of a Stack or Queue to store a set of data, or we are using a Stack or Queue as part of a strategy to solve some problem, Stacks and Queues always store one Node for each value they receive as input.

For this reason, we always consider Stacks and Queues to have a linear space complexity, O(n).

### When should we use Stacks and Queues?

At this point, we've done a lot of work understanding the ins and outs of Stacks and Queues, but we still haven't really discussed what we can use them for. The answer is actually...a lot!

For one, Stacks and Queues can be used as intermediate data structures while implementing some of the more complicated data structures and methods we'll see in some of our upcoming sections.

For example, the implementation of the breadth-first Tree traversal algorithm takes advantage of a Queue instance, and the depth-first Graph traversal algorithm exploits the benefits of a Stack instance.

Additionally, Stacks and Queues serve as the essential underlying data structures to a wide variety of applications you use all the time. Just to name a few:

#### Stacks

- The Call Stack is a Stack data structure, and is used to manage the order of function invocations in your code.
- Browser History is often implemented using a Stack, with one great example being the browser history object in the very popular React Router module.
- Undo/Redo functionality in just about any application. For example:
- When you're coding in your text editor, each of the actions you take on your keyboard are recorded by `push`ing that event to a Stack.
- When you hit [cmd + z] to undo your most recent action, that event is `pop`ed off the Stack, because the last event that occured should be the first one to be undone (LIFO).
- When you hit [cmd + y] to redo your most recent action, that event is `push`ed back onto the Stack.

#### Queues

- Printers use a Queue to manage incoming jobs to ensure that documents are printed in the order they are received.
- Chat rooms, online video games, and customer service phone lines use a Queue to ensure that patrons are served in the order they arrive.
- In the case of a Chat Room, to be admitted to a size-limited room.
- In the case of an Online Multi-Player Game, players wait in a lobby until there is enough space and it is their turn to be admitted to a game.
- In the case of a Customer Service Phone Line...you get the point.
- As a more advanced use case, Queues are often used as components or services in the system design of a service-oriented architecture. A very popular and easy to use example of this is Amazon's Simple Queue Service (SQS), which is a part of their Amazon Web Services (AWS) offering.
- You would add this service to your system between two other services, one that is sending information for processing, and one that is receiving information to be processed, when the volume of incoming requests is high and the integrity of the order with which those requests are processed must be maintained.

### Fundamental Javascript Concepts You Should Understand

### Plain Old JS Object Lesson Concepts

[![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/a0c2f7dd44a6007536c9ac2b18012ae6bba6413db21a72632e7683cb2411e8cb/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f3830302f302a624575616863744a52535f71435167562e6a7067)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/a0c2f7dd44a6007536c9ac2b18012ae6bba6413db21a72632e7683cb2411e8cb/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f3830302f302a624575616863744a52535f71435167562e6a7067)

- Label variables as either Primitive vs. Reference - primitives: strings, booleans, numbers, null and undefined - primitives are immutable - refereces: objects (including arrays) - references are mutable - Identify when to use `.` vs `[]` when accessing values of an object - dot syntax `object.key` - easier to read - easier to write - cannot use variables as keys - keys cannot begin with a number - bracket notation `object["key]` - allows variables as keys - strings that start with numbers can be use as keys - Write an object literal with a variable key using interpolation

#### put it in brackets to access the value of the variable, rather than just make the value that string

```
let a = "b";
    let obj = {
        a: "letter_a",
        [a]: "letter b"
    }

```

- Use the `obj[key] !== undefined` pattern to check if a given variable that contains a key exists in an object
- can also use `(key in object)` syntax interchangeably (returns a boolean)
- Utilize Object.keys and Object.values in a function
- `Object.keys(obj)` returns an array of all the keys in `obj`
- `Object.values(obj)` returns an array of the values in `obj`

#### Iterate through an object using a `for in` loop

```
let printValues = function(obj) {
      for (let key in obj) {
          let value = obj[key];
          console.log(value);
      }
  }

```

#### Define a function that utilizes `...rest` syntax to accept an arbitrary number of arguments

- `...rest` syntax will store all additional arguments in an array
- array will be empty if there are no additional arguments

```
let myFunction = function(str, ...strs) {
        console.log("The first string is " + str);
        console.log("The rest of the strings are:");
        strs.forEach(function(str) {
            console.log(str);
        })
    }

```

#### Use `...spread` syntax for Object literals and Array literals

```
let arr1 = ["a", "b", "c"];
  let longer = [...arr1, "d", "e"]; // ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"]
  // without spread syntax, this would give you a nested array
  let withoutRest = [arr1, "d", "e"] // [["a", "b", "c"], "d", "e"]

```

- Destructure an array to reference specific elements

```
let array = [35, 9];

let [firstEl, secondEl] = array;

console.log(firstEl); // => 35

console.log(secondEl); // => 9

// can also destructure using ... syntax let array = [35, 9, 14]; let [head, ...tail] = array; console.log(head); // => 35 console.log(tail); // => [9, 14]

-Destructure an object to reference specific values
    -
    if you want to use variable names that don 't match the keys, you can use aliasing -
    `let { oldkeyname: newkeyname } = object` -
    rule of thumb--- only destructure values from objects that are two levels deep ``
`javascript
let obj = {
   name: "Wilfred",
   appearance: ["short", "mustache"],
   favorites: {
      color: "mauve",
      food: "spaghetti squash",
      number: 3
   }
}
// with variable names that match keys
let { name, appearance } = obj;
console.log(name); // "Wilfred"
console.log(appearance); // ["short", "mustache"]

// with new variable names (aliasing)
let {name: myName, appearance: myAppearance} = obj;

console.log(myName); // "Wilfred"
console.log(myAppearance); // ["short", "mustache"]

// in a function call
let sayHello = function({name}) {
console.log("Hello, " + name); // "Hello Wilfred"
}

// nested objects + aliasing
let { favorites: {color, food: vegetable} } = obj;
console.log(color, vegetable); //=> mauve spaghetti squash

```

#### Write a function that accepts a array as an argument and returns an object representing the count of each character in the array

```
//
  let elementCounts = function(array) {
      let obj = {};
      array.forEach(function(el) {
          if (el in obj) obj[el] += 1;
          else obj[el] = 1;
      })
      return obj;
  }
  console.log(elementCounts(["e", "f", "g", "f"])); // => Object {e: 1, f: 2, g: 1}

```

### Callbacks Lesson Concepts

- Given multiple plausible reasons, identify why functions are called "First Class Objects" in JavaScript.
- they can be stored in variables, passed as arguments to other functions, and serve as return value for a function
- supports same basic operations as other types (strings, bools, numbers)
- higher-order functions take functions as arguments or return functions as values
- Given a code snippet containing an anonymous callback, a named callback, and multiple `console.log`s, predict what will be printed
- what is this referring to?
- Write a function that takes in a value and two callbacks. The function should return the result of the callback that is greater.

```
let greaterCB = function(val, callback1, callback2) {
    if (callback1(val) > callback2(val)) {
        return callback1(val);
    }
    return callback2(val);
}

let greaterCB = function(val, callback1, callback2) {
    if (callback1(val) > callback2(val)) {
        return callback1(val);
    }
    return callback2(val);
}

```

// shorter version let greaterCB = function(val, callback1, callback2) { return Math.max(callback1(val), callback2(val)); } // even shorter, cause why not let greaterCB = (val, cb1, cb2) => Math.max(cb1(val), cb2(val));

```
-Write a
function, myMap, that takes in an array and a callback as arguments.The
function should mimic the behavior of `Array#map`.
``
`javascript
let myMap = function(array, callback) {
   let newArr = [];
   for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i ++) {
      mapped = callback(array[i], i, array);
      newArr.push(mapped);
   }
   return newArr;
}
console.log( myMap([16,25,36], Math.sqrt)); // => [4, 5, 6];

let myMapArrow = (array, callback) => {
   let newArr = [];
   array.forEach( (ele, ind, array) => {
      newArr.push(callback(ele, ind, array));
   })
   return newArr;
}
console.log(myMapArrow([16,25,36], Math.sqrt)); // => [4, 5, 6];

```

#### Write a function, myFilter, that takes in an array and a callback as arguments. The function should mimic the behavior of `Array#filter`.

```
let myFilter = function(array, callback) {
      let filtered = [];
      for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
          if (callback(array[i])) {
              filtered.push(array[i], i, array);
          }
      }
  }

```

#### Write a function, myEvery, that takes in an array and a callback as arguments. The function should mimic the behavior of `Array#every`.

```
let myEvery = function(array, callback) {
      for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
          if (!callback(array[i], i, array)) {
              return false
          }
      }
      return true;
  }
  // with arrow function syntax
  let myEvery = (array, callback) => {
      for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
          if (!callback(array[i])) {
              return false
          }
      }
      return true;
  }

```

### Scope Lesson Concepts

- Identify the difference between `const`, `let`, and `var` declarations
- `const` - cannot reassign variable, scoped to block
- `let` - can reassign variable, scoped to block
- `var` - outdated, may or may not be reassigned, scoped to function. can be not just reassigned, but also redeclared!
- a variable will always evaluate to the value it contains regardless of how it was declared
- Explain the difference between `const`, `let`, and `var` declarations
- `var` is function scoped---so if you declare it anywhere in a function, the declaration (but not assignment) is "hoisted"
- so it will exist in memory as "undefined" which is bad and unpredictable
- `var` will also allow you to redeclare a variable, while `let` or `const` will raise a syntax error. you shouldn't be able to do that!
- `const` won't let you reassign a variable, but if it points to a mutable object, you will still be able to change the value by mutating the object
- block-scoped variables allow new variables with the same name in new scopes
- block-scoped still performs hoisting of all variables within the block, but it doesn't initialize to the value of `undefined` like `var` does, so it throws a specific reference error if you try to access the value before it has been declared
- if you do not use `var` or `let` or `const` when initializing, it will be declared as global---THIS IS BAD
- if you assign a value without a declaration, it exists in the global scope (so then it would be accessible by all outer scopes, so bad). however, there's no hoisting, so it doesn't exist in the scope until after the line is run
- Predict the evaluation of code that utilizes function scope, block scope, lexical scope, and scope chaining
- scope of a program means the set of variables that are available for use within the program
- global scope is represented by the `window` object in the browser and the `global` object in Node.js
- global variables are available everywhere, and so increase the risk of name collisions
- local scope is the set of variables available for use within the function
- when we enter a function, we enter a new scope
- includes functions arguments, local variables declared inside function, and any variables that were already declared when the function is defined (hmm about that last one)
- for blocks (denoted by curly braces `{}`, as in conditionals or `for` loops), variables can be block scoped
- inner scope does not have access to variables in the outer scope
- scope chaining --- if a given variable is not found in immediate scope, javascript will search all accessible outer scopes until variable is found
- so an inner scope can access outer scope variables
- but an outer scope can never access inner scope variables

#### Define an arrow function

```
let arrowFunction = (param1, param2) => {

let sum = param1 + param2;

return sum;

}

// with 1 param you can remove parens around parameters let arrowFunction = param =>

// if your return statement is one line, you can use implied return let arrowFunction = param => param + 1;

// you don't have to assign to variable, can be anonymous // if you never need to use it again param => param + 1;

```

#### Given an arrow function, deduce the value of `this` without executing the code

- arrow functions are automatically bound to the context they were declared in.
- unlike regular function which use the context they are invoked in (unless they have been bound using `Function#bind`).
- if you implement an arrow function as a method in an object the context it will be bound to is NOT the object itself, but the global context.
- so you can't use an arrow function to define a method directly

```
let obj = {
name: "my object",
unboundFunc: function () {

return this.name;

// this function will be able to be called on different objects

},
boundToGlobal: () => { return this.name; // this function, no matter how you call it, will be called // on the global object, and it cannot be rebound // this is because it was defined using arrow syntax },

makeFuncBoundToObj: function() {
        return () => {
            return this.name;
        }
        // this function will return a function that will be bound
        // to the object where we call the outer method
        // because the arrow syntax is nested inside one of this
        // function's methods, it cannot be rebound
    },

    makeUnboundFunc: function() {
        return function() {
            return this.name;
        }
        //this function will return a function that will still be unbound
    },

    immediatelyInvokedFunc: function() {
        return this.name;
    }(), // this property will be set to the return value of this anonymous function,
    // which is invoked during the object definition;
    // basically, it's a way to check the context inside of an object, at this moment

    innerObj: {
        name: "inner object",
        innerArrowFunc: () => {
            return this.name;
        } // the context inside a nested object is not the parent, it's still
        // the global object. entering an object definition doesn't change the context
    },

    let otherObj = {
        name: "my other object"
    }
// call unboundFunc on obj, we get "my object" console.log("unboundFunc: ", obj.unboundFunc()); // => "my object" // assign unboundFunc to a variable and call it let newFunc = obj.unboundFunc; // this newFunc will default to being called on global object console.log("newFunc: ",newFunc()); // => undefined // but you could bind it directly to a different object if you wanted console.log("newFunc: ", newFunc.bind(otherObj)()); // "my other object"
// meanwhile, obj.boundToGlobal will only ever be called on global object console.log("boundToGlobal: ", obj.boundToGlobal()); //=> undefined let newBoundFunc = obj.boundToGlobal; console.log("newBoundFunc: ", newBoundFunc()); // => undefined // even if you try to directly bind to another object, it won't work! console.log("newBoundFunc: ", newBoundFunc.bind(otherObj)()); // => undefined
// let's make a new function that will always be bound to the context // where we call our function maker let boundFunc = obj.makeFuncBoundToObj();// note that we're invoking, not just assigning console.log("boundFunc: ", boundFunc()); // => "my object" // we can't rebind this function console.log("boundFunc: ", boundFunc.bind(otherObj)()) // =>"my object"
// but if I call makeFuncBoundToObj on another context // the new bound function is stuck with that other context let boundToOther = obj.makeFuncBoundToObj.bind(otherObj)(); console.log("boundToOther: ", boundToOther()); // => "my other object" console.log("boundToOther: ", boundToOther.bind(obj)()) // "my other object"
// the return value of my immediately invoked function // shows that the context inside of the object is the // global object, not the object itself // context only changes inside a function that is called // on an object console.log("immediatelyInvokedFunc: ", obj.immediatelyInvokedFunc); // => undefined
// even though we're inside a nested object, the context is // still the same as it was outside the outer object // in this case, the global object console.log("innerArrowFunc: ", obj.innerObj.innerArrowFunc()); // => undefined

}

-Implement a closure and explain how the closure effects scope
    -
    a closure is "the combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared" -
    alternatively, "when an inner function uses or changes variables in an outer function" -
    closures have access to any variables within their own scope + scope of outer functions + global scope--- the set of all these available variables is "lexical environemnt" -
    closure keeps reference to all variables ** even
if the outer
function has returned **
    -each
function has a private mutable state that cannot be accessed externally
    -
    the inner
function will maintain a reference to the scope in which it was declared.so it has access to variables that were initialized in any outer scope--- even
if that scope
    -
    if a variable exists in the scope of what could have been accessed by a
function(e.g.global scope, outer
    function, etc), does that variable wind up in the closure even
if it never got accessed ?
    -
    if you change the value of a variable(e.g.i++) you will change the value of that variable in the scope that it was declared in

    ``
`javascript
function createCounter() {
   // this function starts a counter at 0, then returns a
   // new function that can access and change that counter
   //
   // each new counter you create will have a single internal
   // state, that can be changed only by calling the function.
   // you can't access that state from outside of the function,
   // even though the count variable in question is initialized
   // by the outer function, and it remains accessible to the
   // inner function after the outer function returns.
   let count = 0;
   return function() {
      count ++;
      return count;
   }
}

let counter = createCounter();
console.log(counter()); //=> 1
console.log(counter()); //=> 2
// so the closure here comes into play because
// an inner function is accessing and changing
// a variable from an outer function

// the closure is the combination of the counter
// function and the all the variables that existed
// in the scope that it was declared in. because
// inner blocks/functions have access to outer
// scopes, that includes the scope of the outer
// function.

// so counter variable is a closure, in that
// it contains the inner count value that was
// initialized by the outer createCounter() function
// count has been captured or closed over

// this state is private, so if i run createCounter again
// i get a totally separate count that doesn't interact
// with the previous one and each of the new functions
// will have their own internal state based on the
// initial declaration in the now-closed outer function

let counter2 = createCounter();
console.log(counter2()); // => 1

// if i set a new function equal to my existing counter
// the internal state is shared with the new function
let counter3 = counter2;
console.log(counter3());

```

#### Define a method that references `this` on an object literal

- when we use `this` in a method it refers to the object that the method is invoked on
- it will let you access other pieces of information from within that object, or even other methods
- method style invocation --- `object.method(args)` (e.g. built in examples like `Array#push`, or `String#toUpperCase`)
- context is set every time we invoke a function
- function style invocation sets the context to the global object no matter what
- being inside an object does not make the context that object! you still have to use method-style invocation
- Utilize the built in `Function#bind` on a callback to maintain the context of this
- when we call bind on a function, we get an exotic function back --- so the context will always be the same for that new function

```
let cat = {
  purr: function () {
  console.log("meow");
  },
  purrMore: function () {
  this.purr();
  },
  };
  let sayMeow = cat.purrMore; console.log(sayMeow()); // TypeError: this.purr is not a function

  // we can use the built in Function.bind to ensure our context, our this, // is the cat object let boundCat = sayMeow.bind(cat);
  boundCat(); // prints "meow"

-`bind`
   can also work with arguments, so you can have a version of a
   function with particular arguments and a particular context.the first arg will be the context aka the `this`
   you want it to use.the next arguments will be the functions arguments that you are binding -
       if you just want to bind it to those arguments in particular, you can use `null`
   as the first argument, so the context won 't be bound, just the arguments -
       Given a code snippet, identify what `this`
   refers to
       -
       important to recognize the difference between scope and context -
       scope works like a dictionary that has all the variables that are available within a given block, plus a pointer back the next outer scope(which itself has pointers to new scopes until you reach the global scope.so you can think about a whole given block 's scope as a kind of linked list of dictionaries) (also, this is not to say that scope is actually implemented in this way, that is just the schema that i can use to understand it) -
           context refers to the value of the `this`
           keyword -
           the keyword `this`
           exists in every
           function and it evaluates to the object that is currently invoking that
           function -so the context is fairly straightforward when we talk about methods being called on specific objects -
           you could, however, call an object 's method on something other than that object, and then this would refer to the context where/how it was called, e.g.
           ``
           `javascript
let dog = {
   name: "Bowser",
   changeName: function () {
      this.name = "Layla";
  },
};

// note this is **not invoked** - we are assigning the function itself
let change = dog.changeName;
console.log(change()); // undefined

// our dog still has the same name
console.log(dog); // { name: 'Bowser', changeName: [Function: changeName] }

// instead of changing the dog we changed the global name!!!
console.log(this); // Object [global] {etc, etc, etc,  name: 'Layla'}

```

### CALLING SOMETHING IN THE WRONG CONTEXT CAN MESS YOU UP!

- could throw an error if it expects this to have some other method or whatever that doesn't exist
- you could also overwrite values or assign values to exist in a space where they should not exist
- if you call a function as a callback, it will set `this` to be the outer function itself, even if the function you were calling is a method that was called on a particular object

```
let cat = {
  purr: function () {
  console.log("meow");
  },
  purrMore: function () {
  this.purr();
  },
  };
  global.setTimeout(cat.purrMore, 5000); // 5 seconds later: TypeError: this.purr is not a function

```

we can use strict mode with `"use strict";` this will prevent you from accessing the global object with `this` in functions, so if you try to call `this` in the global context and change a value, you will get a type error, and the things you try to access will be undefined

```
let sayMeow = cat.purrMore; console.log(sayMeow()); // TypeError: this.purr is not a function

// we can use the built in Function.bind to ensure our context, our this , // is the cat object let boundCat = sayMeow.bind(cat);

boundCat(); // prints "meow"

### POJOs

#### 1\. Label variables as either Primitive vs. Reference

Javascript considers most data types to be 'primitive', these data types are immutable, and are passed by value. The more complex data types: Array and Object are mutable, are considered 'reference' data types, and are passed by reference.

- Boolean --- Primitive
- Null --- Primitive
- Undefined --- Primitive
- Number --- Primitive
- String --- Primitive
- Array --- Reference
- Object --- Reference
- Function --- Reference

#### 2\. Identify when to use . vs [] when accessing values of an object

```
let obj = {
    "one": 1,
    "two": 2
};

// Choose the square brackets property accessor when the property name is determined at
// runtime, or if the property name is not a valid identifier
let myKey = "one";
console.log(obj[myKey]);

// Choose the dot property accessor when the property name is known ahead of time.
console.log(obj.two);

```

#### 3\. Write an object literal with a variable key using interpolation

```
let keyName = "two";

// If the key is not known, you can use an alternative `[]` syntax for
// object initialization only
let obj2 = {
    [keyName]: 2
}
console.log(obj2);

```

#### 4\. Use the obj[key] !== undefined pattern to check if a given variable that contains a key exists in an object

```
function doesKeyExist(obj, key) {
    // obj[key] !== undefined
    // or:
    return key in obj;
}

let course = {
    bootcamp: 'Lambda',
    course: 'Bootcamp Prep'
}
console.log(doesKeyExist(course, 'course')); // => true
console.log(doesKeyExist(course, 'name')); // => false

```

#### 5\. Utilize Object.keys and Object.values in a function

```
function printKeys(object) {
    return Object.keys(object);
}

function printValues(object) {
    return Object.values(object);
}

console.log(printKeys({
    dog: "Strelka",
    dog2: "Belka"
}));
console.log(printValues({
    dog: "Strelka",
    dog2: "Belka"
}));

```

#### 6\. Iterate through an object using a for in loop

```
let player = {
    name: "Sergey",
    skill: "hockey"
};

for (let key in player) {
    console.log(key, player[key]);
}

console.log(Object.entries(player));

```

#### 7\. Define a function that utilizes ...rest syntax to accept an arbitrary number of arguments

```
function restSum(...otherNums) {
    let sum = 0;
    console.log(otherNums);
    otherNums.forEach(function(num) {
        sum += num;
    });

    return sum;
}

console.log(restSum(3, 5, 6)); // => 14
console.log(restSum(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)); // => 45
console.log(restSum(0)); // => 0

```

#### 8\. Use ...spread syntax for Object literals and Array literals

```
let numArray = [1, 2, 3];
let moreNums = [...numArray, 4, 5, 6]

console.log(moreNums);

let shoe = {
    color: "red",
    size: 10
};
let newShoe = {
    ...shoe,
    brand: "Nike",
    size: 12
};
console.log(newShoe);
newShoe.color = "black";
console.log(newShoe);

console.log(shoe);

```

#### 9\. Destructure an array to reference specific elements

```
let arr = ['one', 'two', 'three'];

let [first] = arr;
console.log(first);

```

#### 10\. Destructure an object to reference specific values

```
let me = {
    name: "Ian",
    instruments: ['bass', 'synth', 'guitar'],
    siblings: {
        brothers: ['Alistair'],
        sisters: ['Meghan']
    }
}

let {
    name,
    instruments: musical_instruments,
    siblings: {
        sisters
    }
} = me;

console.log(name);
console.log(musical_instruments);
console.log(sisters);

```

#### 11\. Write a function that accepts a string as an argument and returns an object representing the count of each character in the array

```
function charCount(inputString) {

    let res = inputString.split("").reduce(function(accum, el) {
        if (el in accum) {
            accum[el] = accum[el] + 1;
        } else {
            accum[el] = 1;
        }
        return accum;
    }, {})
    return res;

}

console.log(charCount('aaabbbeebbcdkjfalksdfjlkasdfasdfiiidkkdingds'));

```

### Review of Concepts

#### 1\. Identify the difference between const, let, and var declarations

#### 2\. Explain the difference between const, let, and var declarations

```
var a = "a";

```

- `var` is the historical keyword used for variable declaration.
- `var` declares variables in function scope, or global scope if not inside a function.
- We consider `var` to be deprecated and it is never used in this course.

```
let b = "b";

```

- `let` is the keyword we use most often for variable declaration.
- `let` declares variables in block scope.
- variables declared with `let` are re-assignable.

```
const c = "c";

```

- `const` is a specialized form of `let` that can only be used to **initialize** a variable.
- Except when it is declared, you cannot assign to a `const` variable.
- `const` scopes variables the same way that `let` does.

#### 3\. Predict the evaluation of code that utilizes function scope, block scope, lexical scope, and scope chaining

Consider this `run` function, inside which `foo` and `bar` have `function scope` . `i` and `baz` are scoped to the block expression.

```
// function and block scope in this example
function run() {
    var foo = "Foo";
    let bar = "Bar";

    console.log(foo, bar);

    {
        console.log(foo);
        let baz = "Bazz";
        console.log(baz);
    }

    console.log(baz); // ReferenceError
}

run();

```

Notice that referencing `baz` from outside it's block results in JavaScript throwing a ReferenceError.

Consider this `run` function, inside of which `foo` has `function scope` .

```
function run() {
    console.log(foo); // undefined
    var foo = "Foo";
    console.log(foo); // Foo
}

run();

```

Consider this `func1` function and it's nested scopes.

```
// global scope
function func1(arg1) {
    // func1 scope

    return function func2(arg2) {
        // func2 scope

        return function func3(arg3) {
            // func3 scope

            console.log(arg1, arg2, arg3);
        }
    }
}

```

#### 6\. Implement a closure and explain how the closure effects scope

```
const adder = (arg1) => {
    return (arg2) => {
        return arg1 + arg2;
    }
};

const func2 = adder(2);
const result = func2(2);
console.log(result); // => 4;

```

#### 4\. Define an arrow function

```
const returnValue = (val) => val;

```

This simple construct will create a function that accepts `val` as a parameter, and returns `val` immediately. We do not need to type `return val` , because this is a single-line function.

Identically, we could write

```
const returnValue = (val) => {
    return val;
};

```

#### 5\. Given an arrow function, deduce the value of `this` without executing the code

```
function fDAdder(arr) {
    console.log(this);

    return arr.reduce((acc, ele) => {
        return acc + ele;
    });
};

fDAdder([1, 2, 4, 6]);

```

If we use a function declaration style function, the `this` variable is set to the `global` object (i.e. `Object [global]` in Node. JS and `Window` in your browser).

```
const adder = (arr) => {
    console.log(this);
    arr.reduce((acc, ele) => sum += ele);
};
adder([1, 2, 4, 6]);

```

In this example, we use a fat arrow style function. Note that when we declare a functions like this `this` becomes

#### 7\. Define a method that references this on an object literal

```
const pokemon = {
    firstname: 'Pika',
    lastname: 'Chu',
    getPokeName: function() {
        const fullname = `${this.firstname} ${this.lastname}`;
        return fullname;
    }
};

console.log(pokemon.getPokeName());

```

#### 8\. Utilize the built in Function#bind on a callback to maintain the context of `this`

```
const pokemon = {
    firstname: 'Pika',
    lastname: 'Chu',
    getPokeName: function() {
        const fullname = `${this.firstname} ${this.lastname}`;
        return fullname;
    }
};

const logPokemon = pokemon.getPokename.bind(pokemon);

logPokemon('sushi', 'algorithms'); // Pika Chu loves sushi and algorithms

```

#### 9\. Given a code snippet, identify what `this` refers to

```
function Person(name) {
    // this.name = name;
    // let that = this;

    setTimeout(function() {
        // console.log(this); // => Window
        // console.log(that); // => [Function] => Person
        // this.sayName(); // => no method error
        that.sayName();
    }, 1000);
}

Person.prototype.sayName = function() {
    console.log(this.name);
};

const jane = new Person("Jane");

```

# General guidelines

Help Google find your pages

---

### General guidelines

### Help Google find your pages

- Ensure that all pages on the site can be reached by a link from another findable page. The referring link should include either text or, for images, an alt attribute, that is relevant to the target page. Crawlable links are `<a>` [tags with an href attribute](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/guidelines/links-crawlable).
- Provide a [sitemap file](http://sitemaps.org/) with links that point to the important pages on your site. Also provide a page with a human-readable list of links to these pages (sometimes called a site index or site map page).
- Limit the number of links on a page to a reasonable number (a few thousand at most).
- Make sure that your web server correctly supports the `If-Modified-Since` HTTP header. This feature directs your web server to tell Google if your content has changed since we last crawled your site. Supporting this feature saves you bandwidth and overhead.
- Use the robots.txt file on your web server to manage your crawling budget by preventing crawling of infinite spaces such as search result pages. Keep your robots.txt file up to date. [Learn how to manage crawling with the robots.txt file](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/robots/robots-faq). Test the coverage and syntax of your robots.txt file using the [robots.txt Tester](https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/robots-testing-tool).

**Ways to help Google find your site:**

- [Ask Google to crawl your pages](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/crawling/ask-google-to-recrawl).
- Make sure that any sites that should know about your pages are aware your site is online.

### Help Google understand your pages

- Create a useful, information-rich site, and write pages that clearly and accurately describe your content.
- Think about the words users would type to find your pages, and make sure that your site actually includes those words within it.
- Ensure that your `<title>` elements and `alt` attributes are descriptive, specific, and accurate.
- Design your site to have a clear conceptual page hierarchy.
- Follow our recommended best practices for [images](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/guidelines/google-images), [video](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/guidelines/video), and [structured data](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/intro-structured-data).
- When using a content management system (for example, Wix or WordPress), make sure that it creates pages and links that search engines can crawl.
- To help Google fully understand your site's contents, allow all site assets that would significantly affect page rendering to be crawled: for example, CSS and JavaScript files that affect the understanding of the pages. The Google indexing system renders a web page as the user would see it, including images, CSS, and JavaScript files. To see which page assets that Googlebot cannot crawl use the [URL Inspection tool](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9012289); to debug directives in your robots.txt file, use the [robots.txt Tester](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/6062598) tool.
- Allow search bots to crawl your site without session IDs or URL parameters that track their path through the site. These techniques are useful for tracking individual user behavior, but the access pattern of bots is entirely different. Using these techniques may result in incomplete indexing of your site, as bots may not be able to eliminate URLs that look different but actually point to the same page.
- Make your site's important content visible by default. Google is able to crawl HTML content hidden inside navigational elements such as tabs or expanding sections, however we consider this content less accessible to users, and believe that you should make your most important information visible in the default page view.
- Make a reasonable effort to ensure that advertisement links on your pages do not affect search engine rankings. For example, use [robots.txt](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/robots/intro), `rel="nofollow"`, or `rel="sponsored"` to prevent advertisement links from being followed by a crawler.

### Help visitors use your pages

- Try to use text instead of images to display important names, content, or links. If you must use images for textual content, use the `alt` attribute to include a few words of descriptive text.
- Ensure that all links go to live web pages. Use [valid HTML](https://validator.w3.org/).
- Optimize your page loading times. Fast sites make users happy and improve the overall quality of the web (especially for those users with slow Internet connections). Google recommends that you use tools like [PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/) and [Webpagetest.org](https://www.webpagetest.org/) to test the performance of your page.
- Design your site for all device types and sizes, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones. Use the [Mobile-Friendly Test](https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly) to test how well your pages work on mobile devices, and get feedback on what needs to be fixed.
- Ensure that your site [appears correctly in different browsers](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/guidelines/browser-compatibility).
- If possible, [secure your site's connections](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/security/https) with HTTPS. Encrypting interactions between the user and your website is a good practice for communication on the web.
- Ensure that your pages are useful for readers with visual impairments, for example, by testing usability with a screen-reader.

### Quality guidelines

These quality guidelines cover the most common forms of deceptive or manipulative behavior, but Google may respond negatively to other misleading practices not listed here. It's not safe to assume that just because a specific deceptive technique isn't included on this page, Google approves of it. Website owners who spend their energies upholding the spirit of the basic principles will provide a much better user experience and subsequently enjoy better ranking than those who spend their time looking for loopholes they can exploit.

If you believe that another site is abusing Google's quality guidelines, please let us know by [filing a spam report](https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/spamreport). Google prefers developing scalable and automated solutions to problems, and will use the report for further improving our spam detection systems.

### Basic principles

- Make pages primarily for users, not for search engines.
- Don't deceive your users.
- Avoid tricks intended to improve search engine rankings. A good rule of thumb is whether you'd feel comfortable explaining what you've done to a website that competes with you, or to a Google employee. Another useful test is to ask, "Does this help my users? Would I do this if search engines didn't exist?"
- Think about what makes your website unique, valuable, or engaging. Make your website stand out from others in your field.

### Specific guidelines

**Avoid** the following techniques:

- [Automatically generated content](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/guidelines/auto-gen-content)
- Participating in [link schemes](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/guidelines/link-schemes)
- Creating pages with [little or no original content](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/66361)
- [Cloaking](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/guidelines/cloaking)
- [Sneaky redirects](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/guidelines/sneaky-redirects)
- [Hidden text or links](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/guidelines/hidden-text-links)
- [Doorway pages](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/guidelines/doorway-pages)
- [Scraped content](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/guidelines/scraped-content)
- Participating in [affiliate programs without adding sufficient value](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/guidelines/affiliate-programs)
- Loading pages with [irrelevant keywords](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/guidelines/irrelevant-keywords)
- Creating pages with [malicious behavior](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/guidelines/malicious-behavior), such as phishing or installing viruses, trojans, or other badware
- Abusing [structured data](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/sd-policies) markup
- Sending [automated queries](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/guidelines/automated-queries) to Google

**Follow** good practices:

- Monitoring your site for [hacking](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/security/what-is-hacked) and removing hacked content as soon as it appears
- Preventing and removing [user-generated spam](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/guidelines/user-gen-spam) on your site

If your site violates one or more of these guidelines, then Google may take [manual action](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9044175) against it. Once you have remedied the problem, you can [submit your site for reconsideration](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/35843).

### Getting Started With PostgreSQL

#### In database jargon, PostgreSQL uses a client/server model. A PostgreSQL session consists of the following cooperating processes (programs):

- A server process, which manages the database files, accepts connections to the database from client applications, and performs database actions on behalf of the clients. The database server program is called `postgres`.
- The user's client (frontend) application that wants to perform database operations. Client applications can be very diverse in nature: a client could be a text-oriented tool, a graphical application, a web server that accesses the database to display web pages, or a specialized database maintenance tool. Some client applications are supplied with the PostgreSQL distribution; most are developed by users.

As is typical of client/server applications, the client and the server can be on different hosts. In that case they communicate over a TCP/IP network connection. You should keep this in mind, because the files that can be accessed on a client machine might not be accessible (or might only be accessible using a different file name) on the database server machine.

The PostgreSQL server can handle multiple concurrent connections from clients. To achieve this it starts ("forks") a new process for each connection. From that point on, the client and the new server process communicate without intervention by the original `postgres` process. Thus, the master server process is always running, waiting for client connections, whereas client and associated server processes come and go. (All of this is of course invisible to the user. We only mention it here for completeness.)

### What is SQL?

SQL is short for Structured Query Language. Originally, it used to be called SEQUEL (Structured English Query Language) and was used for storing and manipulating data in databases. Today SQL is used to perform all types of data operations in relational database management systems (RDBMS).

SQL is a powerful language where we can perform a wide range of operations:

- execute queries
- fetch data
- insert, update, and delete records in a database (DML operations)
- create new objects in a database (DDL operations)
- set permissions on tables, procedures, functions, and views
- and much, much more...

### What is the ANSI SQL standard?

The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) created a standard for SQL in 1986, and it was adopted by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1987. For each RDBMS to be compliant with the ANSI standard, they all have to support the major commands, like DML, in a similar manner as closely as possible. More information about the ANSI standard can be found on the [SQL Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL).

SQL follows ANSI/ISO standards, but there are different versions of the SQL language used by different database systems. For example, in PostgreSQL we can perform an INSERT operation using RETURNING clauses, which not all other databases can do.

```
[centos@tushar-ldap-docker bin]$ ./psql postgres
    psql.bin (11.9.17)
    Type "help" for help.
    postgres=# create table tyu(n int);
    CREATE TABLE
    postgres=# insert into tyu values(1),(2) returning *;
    n
    ---
    1
    2
   (2 rows)
   INSERT 0 2

```

But to be compliant with the ANSI standard, all databases support commands (like DELETE, UPDATE, SELECT, INSERT) in the same way---that is, the syntax should work anywhere.

If we check the [PostgreSQL documentation of the INSERT statement](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/sql-insert.html), its conformity to the SQL standard is discussed in the page's Compatibility section:

> _Compatibility_

> _INSERT conforms to the SQL standard, except that the RETURNING clause is a PostgreSQL extension, as is the ability to use WITH with INSERT, and the ability to specify an alternative action with ON CONFLICT. Also, the case in which a column name list is omitted, but not all the columns are filled from the VALUES clause or query, is disallowed by the standard._

> _The SQL standard specifies that OVERRIDING SYSTEM VALUE can only be specified if an identity column that is generated always exists. PostgreSQL allows the clause in any case and ignores it if it is not applicable._

The PostgreSQL documentation includes clear descriptions of any differences from the SQL standard for any command, including:

- DML (INSERT, SELECT, DELETE)
- DDL (CREATE, ALTER, TRUNCATE, DROP, RENAME)
- TCL (COMMIT, ROLLBACK, SAVEPOINT)
- DCL (GRANT, REVOKE)

under each command's Compatibility section.

### SQL query examples

Now let's explore some examples of common and useful PostgreSQL queries that can be used in various situations.

### 1\. CREATE TABLE query in PostgreSQL

[CREATE TABLE](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/sql-createtable.html) is a keyword that will create a new, initially empty table in the database. The table will be owned by the user who has issued this command.

```
postgres=# create table dummy_table(name varchar(20),address text,age int);
      CREATE TABLE

```

### 2\. INSERT query in PostgreSQL

The [INSERT command](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/sql-insert.html) is used to insert data into a table:

```
postgres=# insert into dummy_table values('XYZ','location-A',25);
        INSERT 0 1
        postgres=# insert into dummy_table values('ABC','location-B',35);
        INSERT 0 1
        postgres=# insert into dummy_table values('DEF','location-C',40);
        INSERT 0 1
        postgres=# insert into dummy_table values('PQR','location-D',54);
        INSERT 0 1

```

### 3\. SELECT query without WHERE condition in PostgreSQL

The [SELECT command](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/sql-select.html) (when used without the optional WHERE condition) is used to fetch all data from a database table:

```
postgres=# select * from dummy_table;
        name |  address   | age
        ---------+--------------+ -----
        XYZ   | location-A |  25
        ABC   | location-B |  35
        DEF   | location-C |  40
        PQR   | location-D |  54
        (4 rows)

```

### 4\. UPDATE query in PostgreSQL

[UPDATE](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/sql-update.html) is used to make updates to the data or row(s) of a database table. In the example below we use UPDATE to change the age of a person whose name is 'PQR':

```
postgres=# update dummy_table set age=50 where name='PQR';
        UPDATE 1
        postgres=# select * from dummy_table;
        name |  address   | age
        --------+--------------+-------
        XYZ  | location-A |  25
        ABC  | location-B |  35
        DEF  | location-C |  40
        PQR  | location-D |  50
        (4 rows)

```

Next, we'll use the UPDATE command to change the name and age of a person whose address is 'location-D':

```
postgres=# update dummy_table set name='GHI',age=54 where address='location-D';
UPDATE 1
postgres=# select * from dummy_table;
 name |  address   | age
------+------------+-----
 XYZ  | location-A |  25
 ABC  | location-B |  35
 DEF  | location-C |  40
 GHI  | location-D |  54
(4 rows)

postgres=#

```

If we want to modify all the values in the address and age columns in dummy_table, then we do not need to use the WHERE clause. The UPDATE query would look like this:

```
postgres=# update dummy_table set age=54,address='location-X';
UPDATE 4

postgres=# select * from dummy_table ;
 name |  address   | age
------+------------+--------
 XYZ  | location-X |  54
 ABC  | location-X |  54
 DEF  | location-X |  54
 GHI  | location-X |  54
(4 rows)

postgres=#

```

A RETURNING clause returns the updated rows. This is optional in UPDATE:

```
postgres=# update dummy_table set age=30 where name='XYZ' returning age as age_no;
 age_no
---------
      30
(1 row)

UPDATE 1

```

It is always recommended to perform such operations under transaction blocks (i.e., BEGIN...COMMIT/ROLLBACK;), so we have the option to roll back the operation.

### 5\. DELETE query in PostgreSQL

The [DELETE command](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/sql-delete.html) is used to delete row(s). It can be used with or without the optional WHERE condition, but take note: if the WHERE condition is missing, the command will delete all rows, leaving you with an empty table.

In this example, we are deleting one row whose age column has the value 65:

```
postgres=# delete from dummy_table where age=65;
DELETE 1
postgres=#

```

### 6\. Comparison Operators in PostgreSQL queries

In PostgreSQL, with the help of [comparison operators](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/functions-comparison.html) we can find results where the value in a column is not equal to the specified condition or value.

### Less than or equal to query:

```
postgres=# select * from dummy_table where age <=50;
 name |  address   | age
------+------------+-----
 XYZ  | location-A |  25
 ABC  | location-B |  35
 DEF  | location-C |  40
 PQR  | location-D |  50
(4 rows)

```

### Greater than or equal to query:

```
postgres=# select * from dummy_table where age>=50;
 name |  address   | age
------+------------+-----
 PQR  | location-D |  50
(1 row)

```

### Not equal to query:

```
postgres=# select * from dummy_table where age<>50;
 name |  address   | age
------+------------+-----
 XYZ  | location-A |  25
 ABC  | location-B |  35
 DEF  | location-C |  40
(3 rows)

```

### Equal to query:

```
postgres=# select * from dummy_table where age=50;
 name |  address   | age
------+------------+-----
 PQR  | location-D |  50
(1 row)

```

### 7\. SELECT DISTINCT query in PostgreSQL

The [SELECT DISTINCT](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/sql-select.html#SQL-DISTINCT) statement is used to return only distinct values from the table. It removes any duplicate values.

### SELECT query without DISTINCT clause

```
postgres=# select age from dummy_table order by 1;
 age
-----
   1
   1
   2
   2
   3
(5 rows)

```

### SELECT query with DISTINCT clause

```
postgres=# select distinct age from dummy_table order by 1;
 age
-----
   1
   2
   3
(3 rows)

```

### 8\. TRUNCATE query in PostgreSQL

The [TRUNCATE command](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/sql-truncate.html) is used to empty a table:

```
postgres=# truncate table dummy_table;
TRUNCATE TABLE

```

### 9\. DROP TABLE query in PostgreSQL

This [DROP TABLE command](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/sql-droptable.html) is used to drop a table from the database:

```
postgresql=# drop table if exists dummy;
NOTICE:  table "dummy" does not exist, skipping
DROP TABLE

```

This command has removed the full table, including any associated data, indexes, rules, triggers, and constraints for that table.

### 10\. CREATE VIEW query in PostgreSQL

The [CREATE VIEW](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/sql-createview.html) command is used to generate views. Views are pseudo-tables, which are used to present a full table, subset, or select columns from the underlying table:

```
postgres=# create or replace view vi as select * from dummy_table where age is NULL;
CREATE VIEW

```

### 11\. Create a table in Postgresql using the SELECT statement

Using the syntax in the example below, we can create a table using a SELECT statement:

```
postgres=# select 'My name  is X' as col1 , 10 as col2, 'Address is -XYZ location' as col3  into new_table;
SELECT 1
postgres=# select * from new_table ;
     col1      | col2 |           col3
---------------+------+--------------------------
 My name  is X |   10 | Address is -XYZ location
(1 row)

```

### 12\. Query timeout in PostgreSQL

We can command a query to timeout after a certain period with the help of [GUC parameters](https://www.enterprisedb.com/postgres-tutorials/how-tune-postgresql-guc-parameters) (short for grand unified configuration) like statement_timeout, which aborts any statement that takes more than the specified number of milliseconds:

```
postgresql=# set statement_timeout=10;
SET
postgresql=# select pg_sleep(20);
ERROR:  canceling statement due to statement timeout

```

### 13\. Using CREATE SEQUENCE with the INSERT query in PostgreSQL

The [CREATE SEQUENCE](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/sql-createsequence.html) command is a sequential number generator. Once the sequence is created, we can use the sequence's nextval and currval functions to insert values into a table:

```
postgres=# create sequence seq;
CREATE SEQUENCE
postgres=# create table tab(n int);
CREATE TABLE
postgres=# insert into tab values (nextval('seq'));
INSERT 0 1
postgres=# insert into tab values (currval('seq'));
INSERT 0 1
postgres=# insert into tab values (nextval('seq'));
INSERT 0 1
postgres=# select * from tab;
 n
---
 1
 1
 2
(3 rows)

```

### 14\. Importing BLOB data types into PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL doesn't directly support BLOBs (binary large objects), but we can work with them using the following methods:

Let's assume you have an image (in png format) downloaded in the /home/edb/ folder:

```
[edb@localhost]$ ls /home/edb/mypic.png
/home/edb/mypic.png

```

We want to store this image in the PostgreSQL database.

Go to the bin folder of your PostgreSQL installation and connect to the psql terminal:

```
postgres=# Create table testing(n int,n1 oid);
CREATE TABLE
postgres=# insert into testing values (1,lo_import('/home/edb/mypic.png'));
INSERT 0 1

```

The lo_import() function loads the named file into pg_largeobject and returns an OID (object identifier) value that will refer to the large object. Selecting the testing table will show just the OID and not the bits that have made up this photo.

### 15\. ILIKE query in PostgreSQL

The ILIKE operator is a [matching function](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/functions-matching.html) similar to the LIKE operator, but with the advantage that it matches valus case-insensitively.

```
postgres=# select * from ted;
  n
-----
 TAR
 TaR
 Tar
 tar
(4 rows)

```

### Using ILIKE in a WHERE condition

```
postgres=# select * from ted where n ilike 'TAR%';
  n
-----
 TAR
 TaR
 Tar
 tar
(4 rows)

```

### 16\. Hierarchical queries in PostgreSQL

[Hierarchical queries](https://www.enterprisedb.com/postgres-tutorials/how-run-hierarchical-queries-oracle-and-postgresql) are ones where the results have a structured or parent-child relationship and are displayed in a tree structure. To see how hierarchical queries work, create a dummy table:

```
create table test_table(
  emp_no                int,
  ename                 char(5),
  job                       char(9),
  manager_no        int
);

```

Insert data into 'test_table':

```
insert into test_table values(10,'A1','CEO',null);
insert into test_table values(11, 'B1', 'VP', 10);
insert into test_table values(12, 'B2', 'VP', 10);
insert into test_table values(13, 'B3', 'VP', 10);
insert into test_table values(14, 'C1', 'DIRECTOR', 13);
insert into test_table values(15, 'C2', 'DIRECTOR', 13);
insert into test_table values(16, 'D1', 'MANAGER', 15);
insert into test_table values(17 ,'E1', 'ENGINEER', 11);
insert into test_table values(18, 'E2', 'ENGINEER', 11);

```

We can perform hierarchical queries on this table using the methods below.

### 17\. Length function in PostgreSQL

The [length function](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/functions-string.html) returns the number of characters or number of bytes in a specified string variable.

### Basic SELECT query

```
postgres=# select name,age from dummy_table;
 name | age
------+-----
 XYZ  |  25
 ABC  |  35
 DEF  |  40
 PQR  |  54
 PQR  |
(5 rows)

```

### Query with length function for column name and age

```
postgres=# select length(name),length(age) from dummy_table;
 length | length
--------+--------
      3 |      2
      3 |      2
      3 |      2
      3 |      2
      3 |
(5 rows)

```

### 18\. When a query has no destination for result data in PostgreSQL

Say that while selecting a given function, we receive the error message below:

```
postgresql=# create or replace function f(n int)
returns int
as
$$
begin
select now();
return 1;
 end;
$$ language 'plpgsql';
CREATE FUNCTION
postgres=# select f(9);
ERROR:  query has no destination for result data
HINT:  If you want to discard the results of a SELECT, use PERFORM instead.

```

To avoid such errors, we can either use PERFORM or declare a variable and use it in a [SELECT INTO](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/sql-selectinto.html) statement:

### Using PERFORM

```
postgres=# create or replace function f(n int)
returns int
as
$$
begin
perform
now();
 return 1;
 end;
$$ language 'plpgsql';
CREATE FUNCTION
postgresql=# select f(9);
 f
---
 1
(1 row)

```

### Declaring a variable and using it in a SELECT INTO statement

```
postgres=# create or replace function f(n int)
returns int
as
$$
declare
a date;
begin
select now() into a;
raise notice '%s',a;
return 1;
end;
$$ language 'plpgsql';
CREATE FUNCTION

postgresql=# select f(9);
          NOTICE: 24-SEP-20 13:15:46.23388s
             f
            ---
            1
        (1 row)

```

### 19\. Exporting query result to a text file in PostgreSQL

With the help of the [COPY command](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/sql-copy.html), we can export data from a table to an outside text file as well as import data from a text file into a table.

### Exporting data from a table to a text file

```
postgres=#  copy dummy_table to '/tmp/abc.txt';
COPY 5

postgres=# \! cat /tmp/abc.txt
XYZ    location-A  25
ABC   location-B  35
DEF   location-C  40
PQR   location-D  50
CXC   1   50

```

### Importing data from a text file into a table

```
postgres=# copy dummy_table from '/tmp/abc.txt';
COPY 5

```

- With the help of common table expressions (CTE):

- `postgres=#WITH RECURSIVE cte AS ( SELECT emp_no, ename, manager_no, 1 AS level FROM test_table where manager_no is null UNION ALL SELECT e.emp_no, e.ename, e.manager_no, c.level + 1 FROM cte c JOIN test_table e ON e.manager_no = c.emp_no ) SELECT * FROM cte; emp_no | ename | manager_no | level -----------+----------+------------------+------- 10 | A1 | | 1 11 | B1 | 10 | 2 12 | B2 | 10 | 2 13 | B3 | 10 | 2 14 | C1 | 13 | 3 17 | E1 | 11 | 3 18 | E2 | 11 | 3 15 | C2 | 13 | 3 16 | D1 | 15 | 4 (9 rows) postgres=#`

- Using the tablefunc extension:

1.  The [tablefunc extension](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.3/tablefunc.html) is a contrib module that resides in the contrib/ folder in PostgreSQL sources.
2.  First, create the tablefunc extension:

- `postgres=# CREATE EXTENSION tablefunc; CREATE EXTENSION postgres=#`

1.  Then, use tablefunc's connectby function to display results hierarchically:

- `postgres=# SELECT * FROM connectby('dummy_table', 'emp_no', 'manager_no', '10', 0, '->') AS t(emp_no int, manager_no int, level int, ord text) order by emp_no; emp_no | manager_no | level | ord --------+------------+-------+---------------- 10 | | 0 | 10 11 | 10 | 1 | 10->11 12 | 10 | 1 | 10->12 13 | 10 | 1 | 10->13 14 | 13 | 2 | 10->13->14 15 | 13 | 2 | 10->13->15 16 | 15 | 3 | 10->13->15->16 17 | 11 | 2 | 10->11->17 18 | 11 | 2 | 10->11->18 (9 rows) postgres=#`

### 20\. Listing databases query in PostgreSQL

The following query can be used to show all the databases created:

```
postgres=# select oid,datname from pg_database;
  oid     |  datname
-----------+-----------
 13743 | postgres
     1     | template1
 13742 | template0
(3 rows)

```

We can also list out all the database names using the \l command at the psql prompt.

### 21\. Checking query execution time in PostgreSQL

We can check the time needed for a query to execute by enabling \timing at the psql prompt:

```
postgres=# \timing
Timing is on.

```

The SELECT query will now show the execution time:

```
postgres=# select * from dummy_table;
 name |  address   | age
------+------------+--------
 XYZ  | location-A | 25
 ABC  | location-B | 35
 DEF  | location-C | 40
 PQR  | location-D | 50
 CXC  | 1               | 50
(5 rows)

Time: 0.440 ms
postgres=#

```

### 22\. Dynamic SQL query in PostgreSQL

[Dynamic SQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/ecpg-dynamic.html) is used to reduce repetitive tasks when it comes to querying.\
Dynamic SQL queries are not cached in memory.

```
postgres=# do
postgres-# $$
postgres$# begin
postgres$# execute 'select * from dummy_table';
postgres$# end;
postgres$# $$;
DO

```

### 23\. COUNT query in PostgreSQL

The [COUNT query](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.2/functions-aggregate.html) returns the number of rows in a table. If we use (\*) this will include null values; otherwise null values will be excluded.

```
postgres=# select count(*) from dummy_table;
 count
-------
     5
(1 row)

postgres=# select count(avg) from dummy_table;
 count
-------
     4
(1 row)

```

### 24\. LIMIT and OFFSET query in PostgreSQL

The [LIMIT clause](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/queries-limit.html) is used to limit the data amount returned by the SELECT statement. The query below will display only 1 row:

```
postgres=# select * from dummy_table  limit 1;
 name |  address   | age
------+------------+-----
 XYZ  | location-A |  25
(1 row)

```

[OFFSET](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/queries-limit.html) is used when we want to skip a particular number of rows:

```
postgres=# select * from dummy_table  offset 4;
 name | address | age
------+---------+-----
 cxc  | 1       |  50
(1 row)

```

### 25\. IF ... ELSE expression in PostgreSQL

We can use [conditional statements](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/plpgsql-control-structures.html) like IF ... ELSE in an anonymous block. The example below checks if the values of variables abc and xyz are matching and prints the result--- i.e., 150:

```
postgres=# Do
             $$
             Declare
              abc int;
              xyz int;
              begin
              abc:=100;
              xyz:=abc;
              if abc=xyz then
               xyz=150;
              raise notice '%',xyz;
             else
             end if;
             end;
               $$
;
NOTICE:  150
DO

```

### 26\. UPDATE with JOIN query in PostgreSQL

We can use UPDATE with a JOIN and WHERE clause when we want to update the values from one table (table X) based on values from another table (table Y):

```
postgres=# create table X(n int, n1 char(10));
CREATE TABLE
postgres=# insert into X values (1,'abc');
INSERT 0 1
postgres=# insert into X values (2,'xyz');
INSERT 0 1
postgres=# insert into X values (3,'pqr');
INSERT 0 1

postgres=# create table Y(n int, n1 char(10));
CREATE TABLE

postgres=# insert into Y values (1,'');
INSERT 0 1
postgres=# insert into Y values (2,'');
INSERT 0 1

postgres=# insert into Y values (5,'axyz');
INSERT 0 1

postgres=# update Y set n1=X.n1 from X  where X.n=Y.n;
UPDATE 2
postgres=# select * from Y;
 n |     n1
---+------------
 5 | axyz
 1 | abc
 2 | xyz
(3 rows)

postgres=#

```

### 27\. INNER JOIN query in PostgreSQL

The [INNER JOIN](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/tutorial-join.html) command will find rows from two (or more) tables where the specified columns data in the tables match:

```
postgres=# select *  from x inner join  y on  x.n1 = y.n1;
 n |     n1     | n |     n1
---+------------+---+------------
 1 | abc        | 1 | abc
 2 | xyz        | 2 | xyz
(2 rows)

postgres=#

```

### 28\. CASE expression in PostgreSQL

The [CASE expression](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/functions-conditional.html) is a generic conditional expression, similar to the IF ... ELSE statement.

```
postgres=# SELECT age,
       CASE age WHEN 25 THEN 'one'
              WHEN 50 THEN 'two'
              ELSE 'other'
       END
    FROM  dummy_table;
 age | case
-----+-------
  25 | one
  35 | other
  40 | other
  50 | two
  50 | two
(5 rows)

```

### 29\. PostgreSQL recursive query

Recursive queries are used to deal with hierarchical queries or tree-structured data. The structure of a WITH RECURSIVE query is always: a) Non-recursive term\
  b) UNION (or UNION ALL), then a recursive term

where the recursive term includes a reference to the query's output.

```
CREATE TABLE emp_test (
  id int,
  ename varchar(255),
  emanager int
);

INSERT INTO emp_test VALUES (1, 'abc', null);
INSERT INTO emp_test VALUES (2, 'xyz', 1);
INSERT INTO emp_test VALUES (3, 'def', 2);
INSERT INTO emp_test VALUES (4, 'cde', 1);
INSERT INTO emp_test VALUES (5, 'qrs', 2);
INSERT INTO emp_test VALUES (9, 'iop', 3);
INSERT INTO emp_test VALUES (10, 'klm', 4);

```

The recursive query below will give all the reports in a certain order:

```
postgres=#WITH RECURSIVE emp_testnew  AS (
  SELECT id, ename, emanager
  FROM emp_test
  WHERE id = 2
  UNION ALL
  SELECT e.id, e.ename, e.emanager
  FROM emp_test e
  INNER JOIN emp_testnew e1 ON e1.id = e.emanager
)
SELECT *
FROM emp_testnew;

 id | ename | emanager
----+-------+----------
  2 | xyz   |        1
  3 | def   |        2
  5 | qrs   |        2
  9 | iop   |        3
(4 rows)

postgres=#

```

### 30\. PostgreSQL log queries

Using the [pg_stat_statements module](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/pgstatstatements.html), we can track execution statistics for all SQL statements. To do this, we need to create an extension and add in shared_preload_libraries inside the postgresql.conf file:

```
postgres=# create extension pg_stat_statements;
CREATE EXTENSION

postgres=# show shared_preload_libraries ;
                           shared_preload_libraries
-------------------------------------------------
 $libdir/pg_stat_statements
(1 row)

postgres=# select query from pg_stat_statements where query like 'create table%';
-[ RECORD 1 ]-------------------
query | create table test(n int)

```

We can also configure PostgreSQL to generate log output by enabling these parameters in the postgresql.conf file:

```
logging_collector = on
log_directory = 'log'
log_filename = 'postgresql-%Y-%m-%d_%H%M%S.log'
log_destination = 'stderr'
Log file will be created under the pg_log directory which resides under the data folder.

[centos@tushar-ldap-docker bin]$ ls  data/log
postgresql-2020-09-17_150932.log  postgresql-2020-09-19_000000.log
[centos@tushar-ldap-docker bin]$

```

Queries will be recorded in these files.

### 31\. Using a variable in a PostgreSQL query

We can declare a variable in PostgreSQL at the psql prompt:

```
postgres=# \set cond 50

```

### Using a variable in a WHERE condition

```
postgres=# select * from dummy_table where age=:cond;
 name |  address   | age
------+------------+-----
 PQR  | location-D |  50
(1 row)

```

OR

```
postgres=# \set cond 50
postgres=# select :cond+100 ;
 ?column?
----------
      150
(1 row)

```

### 32\. Date query in PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL offers [functions for date and time](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/functions-datetime.html) that can be used in queries.

```
postgres=# select now();
               now
----------------------------------
 22-SEP-20 03:08:42.636385 +05:30
(1 row)

postgres=# select current_date;
 current_date
--------------
 22-SEP-20
(1 row)

postgres=# select current_time;
     current_time
-----------------------
 03:08:53.648466+05:30
(1 row)

```

We can also perform a date range query to find rows with values between two time stamps:

```
postgres=# create table datetable(n int,n1 date);
CREATE TABLE

postgres=# insert into datetable values (1,'12-01-1980');
INSERT 0 1
postgres=# insert into datetable values (2,'12-01-2020');
INSERT 0 1
postgres=# insert into datetable values (3,'12-01-2000');
INSERT 0 1
postgres=# select * from datetable where n1 between '12-01-1980' and '12-01-2000';
 n |         n1
---+--------------------
 1 | 12-JAN-80 00:00:00
 3 | 12-JAN-00 00:00:00
(2 rows)

```

### 33\. PostgreSQL function RETURN QUERY result

When a PL/pgSQL function is declared to return a SETOF some data type, the return is specified by a [RETURN QUERY](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/plpgsql-control-structures.html) command:

```
postgres=# CREATE FUNCTION get(int) RETURNS SETOF integer AS
$BODY$
BEGIN
    RETURN QUERY SELECT age
                   FROM dummy_table
                  WHERE age >= $1  ;
    RETURN;
 END
$BODY$
LANGUAGE plpgsql;

postgres=# select * from get(9);
 get
-----
  25
  35
  40
  50
(4 rows)

```

### 34\. PostgreSQL parallel query performance

[Parallel queries](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/parallel-query.html) in PostgreSQL allow you to finish queries faster by utilizing many CPUs. These GUCs parameters are set in postgresql.conf file:

```
#max_parallel_maintenance_workers = 2   # taken from max_parallel_workers
#max_parallel_workers_per_gather = 2    # taken from max_parallel_workers
#parallel_leader_participation = on
#max_parallel_workers = 8               # maximum number of max_worker_processes that
                                                           # can be used in parallel operations

postgres=# create table ty(n int);
CREATE TABLE
postgres=# insert into ty values (generate_series(1,300000));
INSERT 0 300000

postgres=# analyze ty;
ANALYZE
postgres=# explain  select * from ty where n<=1;
                             QUERY PLAN
---------------------------------------------------------------------
 Gather  (cost=1000.00..4536.88 rows=30 width=4)
   Workers Planned: 1
   ->  Parallel Seq Scan on ty  (cost=0.00..3533.88 rows=18 width=4)
         Filter: (n <= 1)
(4 rows)

postgres=#

```

### 35\. Logical operators in PostgreSQL

There are three basic [logical operators](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/functions-logical.html) available in PostgreSQL: AND, OR, and NOT.

These operators are used to match conditions in SQL statements---e.g., in WHERE and HAVING clauses.

```
AND = when both boolean expressions are true then it will return TRUE
OR   = when any boolean expression is true then it will return TRUE
NOT = reverses the value of Boolean operator

```

### Some logical operator examples

- `If both expressions are true, then the result is TRUE. postgresql=# select 1=1/1 and 200=2+198 as result_and_operator; result_and_operator --------------------- t (1 row) postgresql=#`
- `If one expression is true and another expression is NULL, then the result is NULL. postgresql=# select 4=4 and null; ?column? ---------- (1 row)`
- `If one expression is true and another expression is false, then the result is TRUE. postgres=# select 1=100 OR 2=2; ?column? ---------- t (1 row)`

### 36\. Catching duplicate rows in a PostgreSQL table

In the following SQL query, there are two records with the value 50:

```
postgres=# select age from dummy_table;
 age
-----
  25
  35
  40
  50
  50
(5 rows)

```

We can use the following SELECT ... HAVING query to find the duplicate rows:

```
postgres=#  select age, count(age) from dummy_table group by age having count(age)>1;
 age | count
-----+-------
  50 |     2
(1 row)

```

### 37\. Enum query in PostgreSQL

[Enumerated (enum) types](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/datatype-enum.html) are data types that comprise a static, ordered set of values.

```
postgres=# CREATE TYPE mood AS ENUM ('sad', 'ok', 'happy');
CREATE TYPE
postgres=# create table testi(n int, n1 mood);
CREATE TABLE
postgres=# insert into testi values (1,'happy');
INSERT 0 1
postgres=# insert into testi values (1,'sad');
INSERT 0 1
postgres=# insert into testi values (1,'ok');
INSERT 0 1

```

If the enum has not been specified, it will give an error:

```
postgres=# insert into testi values (1,'happyo');
ERROR:  invalid input value for enum mood: "happyo"

```

### 38\. Pivot query in PostgreSQL

A pivot table is a useful way to analyze large quantities of data by organizing it into a more manageable format.

```
CREATE TABLE newtb(id SERIAL, rowid varchar(10), attri varchar(10), val varchar(10));
INSERT INTO newtb(rowid, attri, val) values('t1','a1','v1');
INSERT INTO newtb(rowid, attri, val) values('t1','a2','v2');
INSERT INTO newtb(rowid, attri, val) values('t1','a3','v3');
INSERT INTO newtb(rowid, attri, val) values('t1','a4','v4');
INSERT INTO newtb(rowid, attri, val) values('t2','a1','v5');
INSERT INTO newtb(rowid, attri, val) values('t2','a2','v6');
INSERT INTO newtb(rowid, attri, val) values('t2','a3','v7');
INSERT INTO newtb(rowid, attri, val) values('t2','a4','v8');

```

To create a pivot table you need to install the [tablefunc extension](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/tablefunc.html):

```
postgres=# create extension tablefunc;
CREATE EXTENSION

Select *
FROM crosstab(
  'select rowid, attri, val
   from newtb
   where attri = ''a2'' or attri = ''a3''
   order by 1,2')
AS newtb(row_name varchar(10), category_1 varchar(10), category_2 varchar(10), category_3 varchar(10));
 row_name | category_1 | category_2 | category_3
----------+------------+------------+--------------------------
   t1       |              v2        |            v3    |
   t2       |             v6         |             v7   |
(2 rows)

```

### 39\. SELF JOIN query in PostgreSQL

When we join a table against itself, this is called a SELF JOIN. This can be done using INNER JOIN or LEFT JOIN. SELF JOINs are useful when comparing the columns of rows within the same table:

```
postgres=# create table emp1(emp_id int, firstname char(10), lastname char(10) , manager_id int);
CREATE TABLE
postgres=#
postgres=#
postgres=# insert into emp1 values(1,'ABC','XYZ',NULL);
INSERT 0 1
postgres=# insert into emp1 values(2,'TYU','BGV',1);
INSERT 0 1
postgres=# insert into emp1 values(3,'TEU','ZZV',1);
INSERT 0 1
postgres=# insert into emp1 values(4,'REU','AZV',2);
INSERT 0 1
postgres=# insert into emp1 values(5,'QREU','WZV',2);
INSERT 0 1
postgres=# insert into emp1 values(6,'DREU','QZV',3);
INSERT 0 1

postgres=# select a.firstname,b.lastname from emp1 a inner join emp1 b on a.emp_id=b.manager_id order by 1 ;
 firstname  |  lastname
------------+------------
 ABC        | ZZV
 ABC        | BGV
 TEU        | QZV
 TYU        | WZV
 TYU        | AZV
(5 rows)

postgres=#

```

### 40\. Parent-child recursive query in PostgreSQL

With the help of [common table expressions](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/queries-with.html) (CTE) we can perform parent-child recursive queries:

```
postgres=# CREATE TABLE recu_pc (
 id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
 name varchar(10) NOT NULL,
 parent_id integer );
CREATE TABLE

postgres=# insert into recu_pc values (1, 'Grandmother', NULL);
INSERT 0 1
postgres=# insert into recu_pc values (2, 'mother', 1);
INSERT 0 1
postgres=# insert into recu_pc values (3, 'daughter', 2);
INSERT 0 1

postgres=# WITH RECURSIVE rec_q (id) as
(
  SELECT recu_pc.id, recu_pc.name from recu_pc where name='mother'
  UNION ALL
  SELECT recu_pc.id, recu_pc.name from rec_q, recu_pc where recu_pc.parent_id = rec_q.id
  )
SELECT *
FROM rec_q;
 id |   name
----+----------
  2 | mother
  3 | daughter
(2 rows)

```

### 41\. Defining a variable in a query in PostgreSQL

Using an [anonymous block](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/sql-do.html), we can define a variable that can be passed to in a query:

```
postgres=# do
$$
declare
a int;
begin
select age into a from dummy_table
where name ='XYZ';
raise notice '%',a;
end;
$$;
NOTICE:  25
DO

```

### 42\. PREPARE statement in PostgreSQL

A prepared statement is used to optimize performance. When the [PREPARE statement](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/sql-prepare.html) is executed, it is not only parsed but analyzed too, and when we fire the EXECUTE command the prepared statement is planned and executed.

Prepared statements can accept parameters.

```
postgres=# prepare test(int) as
select * from dummy_table where age=$1;
PREPARE

postgres=# execute test(50);
 name |  address   | age
------+------------+---------
 PQR  | location-D |  50
 CXC | 1                |  50
(2 rows)

```

### 43\. Checking NULL values in PostgreSQL

To Identify or select rows that have NULL values, the [IS NULL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/functions-comparison.html) condition can be used in the WHERE clause.

```
postgres=# select * from dummy_table;
 name |  address   | age
------+------------+-----
 XYZ  | location-A |  25
 ABC  | location-B |  35
 DEF  | location-C |  40
 PQR  | location-D |  54
 PQR  | location-D |
(5 rows)

```

Identifying null values in 'age' column:

```
postgres=# select name from dummy_table where age is null;
 name
------
 PQR
(1 row)

```

You can use our materials and instructions to roll out your own workshop in your city, workplace or kitchen! Read more about Rails Girls at [](http://railsgirls.com/)[http://railsgirls.com](http://railsgirls.com/)

### Overview

This is a Sinatra app, deployed at [](http://docs.railsbridge.org/)[http://docs.railsbridge.org](http://docs.railsbridge.org/). The RailsBridge documentation project is home to a few subprojects, including the RailsBridge installfest instructions, which leads students through the various complicated setup instructions for getting Ruby, Rails, Git, etc. installed on their computer (whatever combination of computer, OS, and version they happened to bring to the workshop!), as well as the RailsBridge workshop "Suggestotron" curriculum.

Each subproject (a "site") comprises files stored under the "sites" directory; for instance, the installfest instructions are located at ROOT/sites/en/installfest, while the intro rails curriculum can be found under ROOT/sites/en/intro-to-rails. (The "en" means "English" --- see "Locales" below.)

### kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap

### Purpose of these Roadmaps

> _The purpose of these roadmaps is to give you an idea about the landscape and to guide you if you are confused about what to learn next and not to encourage you to pick what is hip and trendy. You should grow some understanding of why one tool would be better suited for some cases than the other and remember hip and trendy never means best suited for the job._

### Note to Beginners

> *These roadmaps cover everything that is there to learn for the paths listed below. Don't feel overwhelmed, you don't need to learn it all in the beginning if you are just getting started. We are working on the beginner versions of these and will* [_release it soon_](https://roadmap.sh/) *after we are done with the 2021 release of the Backend and DevOps roadmaps.*

If you think that these can be improved in any way, please do suggest.

### sindresorhus/awesome

### The awesome manifesto

If you want your list to be included on `awesome`, try to only include actual awesome stuff in your list. After all, it's a curation, not a collection.

But what is awesome?

### Only awesome is awesome

Research if the stuff you're including is actually awesome. Only put stuff on the list that you or another contributor can personally recommend. You should rather leave stuff out than include too much.

### Awesome badge

This badge is for Awesome lists.

### Motivation

> _Learn how to design large-scale systems._

> _Prep for the system design interview._

### Learn how to design large-scale systems

Learning how to design scalable systems will help you become a better engineer.

System design is a broad topic. There is a vast amount of resources scattered throughout the web on system design principles.

This repo is an organized collection of resources to help you learn how to build systems at scale.

### Learn from the open source community

This is a continually updated, open source project.

[Contributions](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#contributing) are welcome!

### Prep for the system design interview

Fluency on the command line is a skill often neglected or considered arcane, but it improves your flexibility and productivity as an engineer in both obvious and subtle ways. This is a selection of notes and tips on using the command-line that we've found useful when working on Linux. Some tips are elementary, and some are fairly specific, sophisticated, or obscure. This page is not long, but if you can use and recall all the items here, you know a lot.

This work is the result of [many authors and translators](https://github.com/jlevy/the-art-of-command-line/blob/master/AUTHORS.md). Some of this [originally](http://www.quora.com/What-are-some-lesser-known-but-useful-Unix-commands) [appeared](http://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-useful-Swiss-army-knife-one-liners-on-Unix) on [Quora](http://www.quora.com/What-are-some-time-saving-tips-that-every-Linux-user-should-know), but it has since moved to GitHub, where people more talented than the original author have made numerous improvements. [Please submit a question](https://airtable.com/shrzMhx00YiIVAWJg) if you have a question related to the command line. [Please contribute](https://github.com/jlevy/the-art-of-command-line/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) if you see an error or something that could be better!

### papers-we-love/papers-we-love

Papers We Love (_PWL_) is a community built around reading, discussing and learning more about academic computer science papers. This repository serves as a directory of some of the best papers the community can find, bringing together documents scattered across the web. You can also visit the [Papers We Love site](http://paperswelove.org/) for more info.

Due to [licenses](https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#respect-content-licenses) we cannot always host the papers themselves (when we do, you will see a 📜 emoji next to its title in the directory README) but we can provide links to their locations.

If you enjoy the papers, perhaps stop by a local chapter meetup and join in on the vibrant discussions around them. You can also discuss *PWL* events, the content in this repository, and/or anything related to *PWL* on our [Slack](https://paperswelove.slack.com/messages/general/), after [signing-up](http://papersweloveslack.herokuapp.com/) to join it, or on our *#paperswelove* IRC channel on freenode.

### ripienaar/free-for-dev

### free-for.dev

Developers and Open Source authors now have a massive amount of services offering free tiers, but it can be hard to find them all to make informed decisions.

This is a list of software (SaaS, PaaS, IaaS, etc.) and other offerings that have free tiers for developers.

The scope of this particular list is limited to things that infrastructure developers (System Administrator, DevOps Practitioners, etc.) are likely to find useful. We love all the free services out there, but it would be good to keep it on topic. It's a bit of a grey line at times so this is a bit opinionated; do not be offended if I do not accept your contribution.

This list is the result of Pull Requests, reviews, ideas and work done by 900+ people. You too can help by sending [Pull Requests](https://github.com/ripienaar/free-for-dev) to add more services or by remove ones whose offerings have changed or been retired.

*NOTE:* This list is only for as-a-Service offerings, not for self-hosted software. For a service to be eligible it has to offer a free tier and not just a free trial. If the free tier is time-bucketed it has to be for at least a year. We also consider the free tier from a security perspective, so SSO is fine but I will not accept services that restrict TLS to paid-only tiers.

### See how the exact same Medium.com clone (called [Conduit](https://demo.realworld.io/)) is built using different [frontends](https://codebase.show/projects/realworld?category=frontend) and [backends](https://codebase.show/projects/realworld?category=backend). Yes, you can mix and match them, because they all adhere to the same [API spec](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld/blob/master/spec) 😮😎

While most "todo" demos provide an excellent cursory glance at a framework's capabilities, they typically don't convey the knowledge & perspective required to actually build *real* applications with it.

RealWorld solves this by allowing you to choose any frontend (React, Angular 2, & more) and any backend (Node, Django, & more) and see how they power a real world, beautifully designed fullstack app called "[Conduit](https://demo.realworld.io/)".

*Read the* [_full blog post announcing RealWorld on Medium._](https://medium.com/@ericsimons/introducing-realworld-6016654d36b5)

### Implementations

Over 100 implementations have been created using various languages, libraries, and frameworks.

[See the list of implementations on the CodebaseShow website >>>](https://codebase.show/projects/realworld)

### Create a new implementation

[Create a new implementation >>>](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld/blob/master/spec)

Or you can [view upcoming implementations (WIPs)](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld/discussions/categories/wip-implementations).

### How do I get up & running?

Follow the instructions in the README of whatever frontend and/or backend repo's you want to get up and running.

### Can you teach me how to build each stack from scratch?

Yup! We've built step-by-step tutorials for all of our stacks that teach you how to go from `git init` all the way to the production ready application. [Start learning now >>>](https://thinkster.io/tutorials/fullstack)

### Front-End Checklist

#### The Front-End Checklist is an exhaustive list of all elements you need to have / to test before launching your website / HTML page to production.

[How To Use](https://github.com/thedaviddias/Front-End-Checklist#how-to-use) - [Contributing](https://github.com/thedaviddias/Front-End-Checklist#contributing) - [Website](https://frontendchecklist.io/) - [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/front-end-checklist)

Other Checklists:\
 [🎮 Front-End Performance Checklist](https://github.com/thedaviddias/Front-End-Performance-Checklist#---------front-end-performance-checklist-) - [💎 Front-End Design Checklist](https://github.com/thedaviddias/Front-End-Design-Checklist#front-end-design-checklist)

It is based on Front-End developers' years of experience, with the additions coming from some other open-source checklists.

---

### How to use?

All items in the Front-End Checklist are required for the majority of the projects, but some elements can be omitted or are not essential (in the case of an administration web app, you may not need RSS feed for example). We choose to use 3 levels of flexibility:

- means that the item is recommended but can be omitted in some particular situations.
- means that the item is highly recommended and can eventually be omitted in some really particular cases. Some elements, if omitted, can have bad repercussions in terms of performance or SEO.
- means that the item can't be omitted by any reason. You may cause a dysfunction in your page or have accessibility or SEO issues. The testing priority needs to be on these elements first.

Some resources possess an emoticon to help you understand which type of content / help you may find on the checklist:

- 📖: documentation or article
- 🛠: online tool / testing tool
- 📹: media or video content

> *You can contribute to the* Front-End Checklist App *reading the* [_CONTRIBUTING.md file_](https://github.com/thedaviddias/Front-End-Checklist/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) *which explains everything about the project.*

### Graphs

**graph**: collections of data represented by nodes and connections between nodes\
**graphs**: way to formally represent network; ordered pairs\
**graphs**: modeling relations between many items; Facebook friends (you = node; friendship = edge; bidirectional); twitter = unidirectional\
**graph theory**: study of graphs\
**big O of graphs**: G = V(E)

trees are a type of graph

Components required to make a graph:

- **nodes or vertices**: represent objects in a dataset (cities, animals, web pages)
- **edges**: connections between vertices; can be bidirectional
- **weight**: cost to travel across an edge; optional (aka cost)

Useful for:

- maps
- networks of activity
- anything you can represent as a network
- multi-way relational data

Types of Graphs:

- **directed**: can only move in one direction along edges; which direction indicated by arrows
- **undirected**: allows movement in both directions along edges; bidirectional
- **cyclic**: weighted; edges allow you to revisit at least 1 vertex; example weather
- **acyclical**: vertices can only be visited once; example recipe

Two common ways to represent graphs in code:

- **adjacency lists**: graph stores list of vertices; for each vertex, it stores list of connected vertices
- **adjacency matrices**: two-dimensional array of lists with built-in edge weights; denotes no relationship

Both have strengths and weaknesses.

### Questions

#### What is a Graph?

A Graph is a data structure that models objects and pairwise relationships between them with nodes and edges. For example: Users and friendships, locations and paths between them, parents and children, etc.

#### Why is it important to learn Graphs?

Graphs represent relationships between data. Anytime you can identify a relationship pattern, you can build a graph and often gain insights through a traversal. These insights can be very powerful, allowing you to find new relationships, like users who have a similar taste in music or purchasing.

#### How many types of graphs are there?

Graphs can be directed or undirected, cyclic or acyclic, weighted or unweighted. They can also be represented with different underlying structures including, but not limited to, adjacency lists, adjacency matrices, object and pointers, or a custom solution.

#### What is the time complexity (big-O) to add/remove/get a vertex/edge for a graph?

It depends on the implementation. ([Graph Representations](https://github.com/LambdaSchool/Graphs/tree/master/objectives/graph-representations)). Before choosing an implementation, it is wise to consider the tradeoffs and complexities of the most commonly used operations.

### Graph Representations

The two most common ways to represent graphs in code are adjacency lists and adjacency matrices, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. When deciding on a graph implementation, it's important to understand the type of data and operations you will be using.

### Adjacency List

In an adjacency list, the graph stores a list of vertices and for each vertex, a list of each vertex to which it's connected. So, for the following graph...

...an adjacency list in Python could look something like this:

```
class Graph:
    def __init__(self):
        self.vertices = {
                          "A": {"B"},
                          "B": {"C", "D"},
                          "C": {"E"},
                          "D": {"F", "G"},
                          "E": {"C"},
                          "F": {"C"},
                          "G": {"A", "F"}
                        }

```

Note that this adjacency list doesn't actually use any lists. The `vertices` collection is a `dictionary` which lets us access each collection of edges in O(1) constant time while the edges are contained in a `set` which lets us check for the existence of edges in O(1) constant time.

### Adjacency Matrix

Now, let's see what this graph might look like as an adjacency matrix:

```
class Graph:
    def __init__(self):
        self.edges = [[0,1,0,0,0,0,0],
                      [0,0,1,1,0,0,0],
                      [0,0,0,0,1,0,0],
                      [0,0,0,0,0,1,1],
                      [0,0,1,0,0,0,0],
                      [0,0,1,0,0,0,0],
                      [1,0,0,0,0,1,0]]

```

We represent this matrix as a two-dimensional array, or a list of lists. With this implementation, we get the benefit of built-in edge weights but do not have an association between the values of our vertices and their index.

In practice, both of these would probably contain more information by including Vertex or Edge classes.

### Tradeoffs

Both adjacency matrices and adjacency lists have their own strengths and weaknesses. Let's explore their tradeoffs.

For the following:

```
V: Total number of vertices in the graph
E: Total number of edges in the graph
e: Average number of edges per vertex

```

#### Space Complexity

- **Adjacency Matrix**: O(V ^ 2)
- **Adjacency List**: O(V + E)

Consider a sparse graph with 100 vertices and only one edge. An adjacency list would have to store all 100 vertices but only needs to keep track of that single edge. The adjacency matrix would need to store 100x100=10,000 possible connections, even though all but one would be 0.

Now consider a dense graph where each vertex points to each other vertex. In this case, the total number of edges will approach V² so the space complexities of each are comparable. However, dictionaries and sets are less space efficient than lists so for dense graphs, the adjacency matrix is more efficient.

Takeaway: Adjacency lists are more space efficient for **sparse** graphs while adjacency matrices become efficient for **dense** graphs.

#### Add Vertex

- **Adjacency Matrix**: O(V)
- **Adjacency List**: O(1)

Adding a vertex is extremely simple in an adjacency list:

```
self.vertices["H"] = set()

```

Adding a new key to a dictionary is a constant-time operation.

For an adjacency matrix, we would need to add a new value to the end of each existing row, then add a new row at the end.

```
for v in self.edges:
  self.edges[v].append(0)
v.append([0] * len(self.edges + 1))

```

Remember that with Python lists, appending to the end of a list is usually O(1) due to over-allocation of memory but can be O(n) when the over-allocated memory fills up. When this occurs, adding the vertex can be O(V²).

Takeaway: Adding vertices is very efficient in adjacency lists but very inefficient for adjacency matrices.

#### Remove Vertex

- **Adjacency Matrix**: O(V ^ 2)
- **Adjacency List**: O(V)

Removing vertices is pretty inefficient in both representations. In an adjacency matrix, we need to remove the removed vertex's row, then remove that column from each other row. Removing an element from a list requires moving everything after that element over by one slot which takes an average of V/2 operations. Since we need to do that for every single row in our matrix, that results in a V² time complexity. On top of that, we need to reduce the index of each vertex after our removed index by 1 as well which doesn't add to our quadratic time complexity, but does add extra operations.

For an adjacency list, we need to visit each vertex and remove all edges pointing to our removed vertex. Removing elements from sets and dictionaries is a O(1) operation, so this results in an overall O(V) time complexity.

Takeaway: Removing vertices is inefficient in both adjacency matrices and lists but more inefficient in matrices.

#### Add Edge

- **Adjacency Matrix**: O(1)
- **Adjacency List**: O(1)

Adding an edge in an adjacency matrix is quite simple:

```
self.edges[v1][v2] = 1

```

Adding an edge in an adjacency list is similarly simple:

```
self.vertices[v1].add(v2)

```

Both are constant-time operations.

Takeaway: Adding edges to both adjacency lists and matrices is very efficient.

#### Remove Edge

- **Adjacency Matrix**: O(1)
- **Adjacency List**: O(1)

Removing an edge from an adjacency matrix is quite simple:

```
self.edges[v1][v2] = 0

```

Removing an edge from an adjacency list is similarly simple:

```
self.vertices[v1].remove(v2)

```

Both are constant-time operations.

Takeaway: Removing edges from both adjacency lists and matrices is very efficient.

#### Find Edge

- **Adjacency Matrix**: O(1)
- **Adjacency List**: O(1)

Finding an edge in an adjacency matrix is quite simple:

```
return self.edges[v1][v2] > 0

```

Finding an edge in an adjacency list is similarly simple:

```
return v2 in self.vertices[v1]

```

Both are constant-time operations.

Takeaway: Finding edges from both adjacency lists and matrices is very efficient.

#### Get All Edges from Vertex

- **Adjacency Matrix**: O(V)
- **Adjacency List**: O(1)

Say you want to know all the edges originating from a particular vertex. With an adjacency list, this is as simple as returning the value from the vertex dictionary:

```
return self.vertex[v]

```

In an adjacency matrix, however, it's a bit more complicated. You would need to iterate through the entire row and populate a list based on the results:

```
v_edges = []
for v2 in self.edges[v]:
    if self.edges[v][v2] > 0:
        v_edges.append(v2)
return v_edges

```

Takeaway: Fetching all edges is more efficient in an adjacency list than an adjacency matrix.

### Breadth-First Search

Can use breadth-first search when searching a graph; explores graph outward in rings of increasing distance from starting vertex; never attempts to explore vertex it is or has already explored

#### BFS

[![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/02edb24202634a0efbec27da0a904d0f29638cb3b5015462b4548fcdeb23033c/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f3830302f302a574f7672797349346658366550714e2d2e676966)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/02edb24202634a0efbec27da0a904d0f29638cb3b5015462b4548fcdeb23033c/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f3830302f302a574f7672797349346658366550714e2d2e676966)

### Applications of BFS

- pathfinding, routing
- web crawlers
- find neighbor nodes in P2P network
- finding people/connections away on social network
- find neighboring locations on graph
- broadcasting on a network
- cycle detection in a graph
- finding connected components
- solving several theoretical graph problems

### Coloring BFS

It's useful to color vertexes as you arrive at them and as you leave them behind as already searched.

**unlisted**: white\
**vertices whose neighbors are being explored**: gray\
**vertices with no unexplored neighbors**: black

### BFS Pseudocode

```
def BFS(graph, start_vert):
    for v of graph.vertices:
        v.color = white
    start_vert.color = gray
    queue.enqueue(start_vert)
    while !queue isEmpty():
    # peek at head but don't dequeue
    u = queue[0]
    for v of u.neighbors:
        if v.color == white:
            v.color == gray
            queue.enqueue(v)
    queue.dequeue()
    u.color = black

```

### BFS Steps

1.  Mark graph vertices white.
2.  Mark starting vertex gray.
3.  Enqueue starting vertex.
4.  Check if queue is not empty.
5.  If not empty, peek at first item in queue.
6.  Loop through that vertex's neighbors.
7.  Check if unvisited.
8.  If unvisited, mark as gray and enqueue vertex.
9.  Dequeue current vertex and mark as black.
10. Repeat until all vertices are explored.

### Depth-First Search

dives down the graph as far as it can before backtracking and exploring another branch; never attempts to explore a vertex it has already explored or is in the process of exploring; exact order will vary depending on which branches get taken first and which is starting vertex

#### DFS:

[![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/641d822475de0ebc4e447dfd0b43a927855c1358446058dc75a8fb17b0c11f69/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f3830302f302a445a56646e316b5761694a58515f7a632e676966)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/641d822475de0ebc4e447dfd0b43a927855c1358446058dc75a8fb17b0c11f69/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f3830302f302a445a56646e316b5761694a58515f7a632e676966)

### Applications of DFS

- preferred method for exploring a graph if we want to ensure we visit every node in graph
- finding minimum spanning trees of weighted graphs
- pathfinding
- detecting cycles in graphs
- solving and generating mazes
- topological sorting, useful for scheduling sequences of dependent jobs

### DFS Pseudocode

```
# recursion
def explore(graph):
    visit(this_vert)
    explore(remaining_graph)

# iterative
def DFS(graph):
    for v of graph.verts:
        v.color = white
        v.parent = null
    for v of graph.verts:
        if v.color == white:
            DFS_visit(v)

def DFS_visit(v):
    v.color = gray
    for neighbor of v.adjacent_nodes:
        if neighbor.color == white:
            neighbor.parent = v
            DFS_visit(neighbor)
    v.color = black

```

### DFS Steps

1.  Take graph as parameter.
2.  Marks all vertices as unvisited.
3.  Sets vertex parent as null.
4.  Passes each unvisited vertex into DFS_visit().
5.  Mark current vertex as gray.
6.  Loops through its unvisited neighbors.
7.  Sets parent and makes recursive call to DFS_visit().
8.  Marks vertex as black.
9.  Repeat until done.

### Connected Components

**connected components**: in a disjoint graph, groups of nodes on a graph that are connected with each other

### Uses

- typically very large graphs, networks
- social networks
- networks (which devices can reach one another)
- epidemics (how spread, who started, where next)

**key to finding connected components**: searching algorithms, breadth-first search

### How to find connected componnents

- for each node in graph:
- has it been explored
- if no, do BFS
- all nodes reached are connected
- if yes, already in connected component
- go to next node

**strongly connected components**: any node in this group can get to any other node

### Bonus Python Question:

```
'''

This Bellman-Ford Code is for determination whether we can get

shortest path from given graph or not for single-source shortest-paths problem.

In other words, if given graph has any negative-weight cycle that is reachable

from the source, then it will give answer False for "no solution exits".

For argument graph, it should be a dictionary type

such as

graph = {

'a': {'b': 6, 'e': 7},

'b': {'c': 5, 'd': -4, 'e': 8},

'c': {'b': -2},

'd': {'a': 2, 'c': 7},

'e': {'b': -3}

}

```

- A graph is any collection of nodes and edges.
- A graph is a less restrictive class of collections of nodes than structures like a tree.
- It doesn't need to have a root node (not every node needs to be accessible from a single node)
- It can have cycles (a group of nodes whose paths begin and end at the same node)

[![Cycles in a graph](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/de5a7e15b8f44e6e7ac31147d9656171b6b231f1ca88a4b7d857e3d6f758b98d/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f3830302f302a6e4e325836544379304a5368346d664c2e676966)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/de5a7e15b8f44e6e7ac31147d9656171b6b231f1ca88a4b7d857e3d6f758b98d/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f3830302f302a6e4e325836544379304a5368346d664c2e676966)

Cycles in a graph- Cycles are not always "isolated", they can be one part of a larger graph. You can detect them by starting your search on a specific node and finding a path that takes you back to that same node.

[![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/87ae0ef3f143c345c239425e9dcf7a2f3d4ea3f9a972e284b00ea91dfde4f432/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f3830302f302a304564477144556c6a5f48456e7945632e706e67)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/87ae0ef3f143c345c239425e9dcf7a2f3d4ea3f9a972e284b00ea91dfde4f432/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f3830302f302a304564477144556c6a5f48456e7945632e706e67)

- Any number of edges may leave a given node - A Path is a sequence of nodes on a graph

### Undirected Graph

**Undirected Graph:** An undirected graph is one where the edges do not specify a particular direction. The edges are bi-directional.

### Types:

[![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/ab17493a4ec77cadc181efe2c4002b24b3578c94ba0e9a930b51dfd82e8920c3/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f3830302f312a75384e753832396750747855364a307369776c6a4a412e706e67)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/ab17493a4ec77cadc181efe2c4002b24b3578c94ba0e9a930b51dfd82e8920c3/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f3830302f312a75384e753832396750747855364a307369776c6a4a412e706e67)

### Dense Graph

- Dense Graph --- A graph with lots of edges.
- "Dense graphs have many edges. But, wait! ⚠️ I know what you must be thinking, how can you determine what qualifies as "many edges"? This is a little bit too subjective, right? ? I agree with you, so let's quantify it a little bit:
- Let's find the maximum number of edges in a directed graph. If there are |V| nodes in a directed graph (in the example below, six nodes), that means that each node can have up to |v| connections (in the example below, six connections).
- Why? Because each node could potentially connect with all other nodes and with itself (see "loop" below). Therefore, the maximum number of edges that the graph can have is |V|\*|V| , which is the total number of nodes multiplied by the maximum number of connections that each node can have."
- When the number of edges in the graph is close to the maximum number of edges, the graph is dense.

### Sparse Graph

- Sparse Graph --- Few edges
- When the number of edges in the graph is significantly fewer than the maximum number of edges, the graph is sparse.

### Weighted Graph

- Weighted Graph --- Edges have a cost or a weight to traversal

### Directed Graph

- Directed Graph --- Edges only go one direction

### *Undirected* Graph

- Undirected Graph --- Edges don't have a direction. All graphs are assumed to be undirected unless otherwise stated

### Node Class

Uses a class to define the neighbors as properties of each node.

### Adjacency Matrix

The row index will correspond to the source of an edge and the column index will correspond to the edges destination.

- When the edges have a direction, `matrix[i][j]` may not be the same as `matrix[j][i]`
- It is common to say that a node is adjacent to itself so `matrix[x][x]` is true for any node
- Will be O(n²) space complexity

### Adjacency List

Seeks to solve the shortcomings of the matrix implementation. It uses an object where keys represent node labels and values associated with that key are the adjacent node keys held in an array.

### How To Implement Native(ES6) Data Structures Using Arrays & Objects

[Abstract data types, commonly abbreviated ADTs, are a way of classifying data structures based on how they are used and the behaviors they provide.](https://stackoverflow.com/a/65771454/15158587) They do not specify how the data structure must be implemented or laid out in memory, but simply provide a minimal expected interface and set of behaviors. For example, a stack is an abstract data type that specifies a linear data structure with LIFO (last in, first out) behavior. Stacks are commonly implemented using arrays or linked lists, but a needlessly complicated implementation using a binary search tree is still a valid implementation. To be clear, it is incorrect to say that stacks are arrays or vice versa. An array can be used as a stack. Likewise, a stack can be implemented using an array.

Since abstract data types don't specify an implementation, this means it's also incorrect to talk about the time complexity of a given abstract data type. An associative array may or may not have O(1) average search times. An associative array that is implemented by a hash table does have O(1) average search times.

### [Components of HTTP-based systems](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview#components_of_http-based_systems "Permalink to Components of HTTP-based systems")

HTTP is a client-server protocol: requests are sent by one entity, the user-agent (or a proxy on behalf of it). Most of the time the user-agent is a Web browser, but it can be anything, for example a robot that crawls the Web to populate and maintain a search engine index.

Each individual request is sent to a server, which handles it and provides an answer, called the *response*. Between the client and the server there are numerous entities, collectively called [proxies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Proxy_server), which perform different operations and act as gateways or [caches](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Cache), for example.

**Properties of HTTP**

- `Reliable Connections` : Messages passed between a client & server sacrifice a little speed for the sake of trust.
- `TCP` is HTTP's preferred connection type.
- `Stateless Transfer` : HTTP is a stateless protocol - meaning it does not store any kind of information.
- HTTP supports cookies.
- `Intermediaries` : Servers or devices that pass your request along which come in three types:

1.  `Proxies` : Modify your request so it appears to come from a different source.
2.  `Gateways` : Pretend to be the resource server you requested.
3.  `Tunnels` : Simply passes your request along.

### HTTP Requests

**Structure of an HTTP Request**

```
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: appacademy.io
Connection: keep-alive
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_14_5) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/76.0.3809.132 Safari/537.36
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9

```

### Example of a request:

[![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/60e77e8f739f6f34b7f7185304be4fffe23443dcbd4316db274ee217afd8f12c/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f313230302f312a74712d425259757a5a5f44783873316735784a4b4b512e706e67)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/60e77e8f739f6f34b7f7185304be4fffe23443dcbd4316db274ee217afd8f12c/68747470733a2f2f63646e2d696d616765732d312e6d656469756d2e636f6d2f6d61782f313230302f312a74712d425259757a5a5f44783873316735784a4b4b512e706e67)

- **Request-line & HTTP verbs**
- The first line of an HTTP Request made up of three parts:

1.  The `Method` : Indicated by an HTTP Verb.
2.  The `URI` : Uniform Resource Indicator that ID's our request.
3.  THe `HTTP` **Version** : Version we expect to use.

- HTTP Verbs are a simply way of declaring our intention to the server.
- `GET` : Used for direct requests.
- `POST`: Used for creating new resources on the server.
- `PUT`: Used to updated a resource on the server.
- `PATCH` : Similar to PUT, but do not require the whole resource to perform the update.
- `DELETE` : Used to destroy resources on the server.

**Headers**

- Key-Value pairs that come after the request line --- they appear on sep. lines and define metadata needed to process the request.
- Some common headers:
- `Host` : Root path for our URI.
- `User-Agent` : Displays information about which browser the request originated from.
- `Referer` : Defines the URL you're coming from.
- `Accept` : Indicates what the client will receive.
- `Content`**-** : Define Details about the body of the request.

**Body**

- For when we need to send data that doesn't fit into the header & is too complex for the URI we can use the *body*.
- `URL encoding` : Most common way form data is formatted.
- `name=claire&age=29&iceCream=vanilla`
- We can also format using JSON or XML.

**Sending an HTTP request from the command line**

- **netcat** : (nc) A Utility that comes as part of Unix-line environments such as Ubuntu and macOS.
- Allows us to open a direct connection with a URL and manually send HTTP requests.
- `nc -v appacademy.io 80`
- `man nc` to open the netcat manual.

### HTTP Responses

**Structure of a Response**

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Connection: close
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
X-Xss-Protection: 1; mode=block
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
Cache-Control: max-age=0, private, must-revalidate
Set-Cookie: _rails-class-site_session=BAh7CEkiD3Nlc3Npb25faWQGOgZFVEkiJTM5NWM5YTVlNTEyZDFmNTNlN; path=/; secure; HttpOnly
X-Request-Id: cf5f30dd-99d0-46d7-86d7-6fe57753b20d
X-Runtime: 0.006894
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000
Vary: Origin
Via: 1.1 vegur
Expect-CT: max-age=604800, report-uri="https://report-uri.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/beacon/expect-ct"
Server: cloudflare
CF-RAY: 51d641d1ca7d2d45-TXL

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
...
...
</html>

```

**Status**

- First line of an HTTP response --- gives us a high level overview of the server's intentions. (`status line`)
- `HTTP/1.1 200 OK`
- `HTTP status codes` : numeric way of representing a server's response.
- Follow the structure: x: xxx --- xxx;

### `Status codes 100 - 199: Informational`

- Allow the clinet to know that a req. was received, and provides extra info from the server.

### `Status codes 200 - 299: Successful`

- Indicate that the request has succeeded and the server is handling it.
- Common Examples: 200 OK (req received and fulfilled) & 201 Created (received and new record was created)

### `Status codes 300 - 399: Redirection`

- Let the client know if there has been a change.
- Common Examples: 301 Moved Permanently (resource you requested is in a totally new location) & 302 Found (indicates a temporary move)

### `Status codes 400 - 499: Client Error`

- Indicate problem with client's request.
- Common Examples: 400 Bad Request (received, but could not understand) & 401 Unauthorized (resource exists but you're not allowed to see w/o authentication) & 403 Forbidden (resource exists but you're not allowed to see it at all ) & 404 Not Found (resource requested does not exist);

### `Status codes 500 - 599: Server Error`

- Indicates request was formatted correctly, but the server couldn't do what you asked due to an internal problem.
- Common Examples: 500 Internal Server Error (Server had trouble processing) & 504 Gateway Timeout (Server timeout);

### **Headers** : Work just like HTTP requests.

> Common Examples:

- `Location` : Used by client for redirection responses.
- `Content-Type` : Let's client know what format the body is in.
- `Expires` : When response is no longer valid
- `Content-Disposition` : Let's client know how to display the response.
- `Set-Cookie` : Sends data back to the client to set on the cookie.
- `Data` : If the request is successful, the body of the response will contain the resource you have requested.

### Introduction to React for Complete Beginners

All of the code examples below will be included a second time at the bottom of this article as an embedded gist, so that it is properly syntax highlighted.

React uses a syntax extension of JavaScript called JSX that allows you to write HTML directly within JavaScript.

### React

> _React uses a syntax extension of JavaScript called JSX that allows you to write HTML directly within JavaScript_

> _because JSX is a syntactic extension of JavaScript, you can actually write JavaScript directly within JSX_

> _include the code you want to be treated as JavaScript within curly braces: { 'this is treated as JavaScript code' }_

> _JSX code must be compiled into JavaScript_

> _under the hood the challenges are calling ReactDOM.render (JSX, document.getElementById('root'))_

> _One important thing to know about nested JSX is that it must return a single element._

> _For instance, several JSX elements written as siblings with no parent wrapper element will not transpile._

---

### From the React Docs:

### What is React?

React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called "components".

React has a few different kinds of components, but we'll start with `React.Component` subclasses:

```
class ShoppingList extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="shopping-list">
        <h1>Shopping List for {this.props.name}</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>Instagram</li>
          <li>WhatsApp</li>
          <li>Oculus</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

// Example usage: <ShoppingList name="Mark" />

```

We'll get to the funny XML-like tags soon. We use components to tell React what we want to see on the screen. When our data changes, React will efficiently update and re-render our components.

Here, ShoppingList is a **React component class**, or **React component type**. A component takes in parameters, called `props` (short for "properties"), and returns a hierarchy of views to display via the `render` method.

The `render` method returns a *description* of what you want to see on the screen. React takes the description and displays the result. In particular, `render` returns a **React element**, which is a lightweight description of what to render. Most React developers use a special syntax called "JSX" which makes these structures easier to write. The `<div />` syntax is transformed at build time to `React.createElement('div')`. The example above is equivalent to:

```
return React.createElement('div', {className: 'shopping-list'},
  React.createElement('h1', /* ... h1 children ... */),
  React.createElement('ul', /* ... ul children ... */)
);

```

---

### Valid JSX:

```
<div>
  <p>Paragraph One</p>
  <p>Paragraph Two</p>
  <p>Paragraph Three</p>
</div>

```

---

### Invalid JSX:

```
<p>Paragraph One</p>
<p>Paragraph Two</p>
<p>Paragraph Three</p>

```

#### To put comments inside JSX, you use the syntax {/\* \*/} to wrap around the comment text.

To put comments inside JSX, you use the syntax {/\* \*/} to wrap around the comment text.

The code editor has a JSX element similar to what you created in the last challenge. Add a comment somewhere within the provided div element, without modifying the existing h1 or p elements.

```
const JSX = (
  <div>
  {/* This is a comment */}
    <h1>This is a block of JSX</h1>
    <p>Here's a subtitle</p>
  </div>
);

```

---

> _With React, we can render this JSX directly to the HTML DOM using React's rendering API known as ReactDOM._

> _ReactDOM offers a simple method to render React elements to the DOM which looks like this:_

`ReactDOM.render(componentToRender, targetNode)`

- the first argument is the React element or component that you want to render,
- and the second argument is the DOM node that you want to render the component to.

> _ReactDOM.render() must be called after the JSX element declarations, just like how you must declare variables before using them._

> _key difference in JSX is that you can no longer use the word class to define HTML classes._

- --- -> This is because class is a reserved word in JavaScript. Instead, JSX uses className

> _the naming convention for all HTML attributes and event references in JSX become camelCase_

> _a click event in JSX is onClick, instead of onclick. Likewise, onchange becomes onChange. While this is a subtle difference, it is an important one to keep in mind moving forward._

### Apply a class of myDiv to the div provided in the JSX code.

- The constant JSX should return a div element.
- The div should have a class of myDiv.

```
const JSX = (
  <div>
    <h1>Add a class to this div</h1>
  </div>
);

```

### Ans:

```
const JSX = (
  <div className="myDiv">
    <h1>Add a class to this div</h1>
  </div>
);

```

### React: Learn About Self-Closing JSX Tags

-Another important way in which JSX differs from HTML is in the idea of the self-closing tag.

> *In HTML, almost all tags have both an opening and closing tag:* `<div></div>;` *the closing tag always has a forward slash before the tag name that you are closing.*

> _there are special instances in HTML called "self-closing tags", or tags that don't require both an opening and closing tag before another tag can start._

> *For example the line-break tag can be written as* `<br>` *or as* `<br />,` *but should never be written as* `<br></br>`_, since it doesn't contain any content._

> *In JSX, the rules are a little different. Any JSX element can be written with a self-closing tag, and every element must be closed.\
> The line-break tag, for example, must always be written as* `<br />` *in order to be valid JSX that can be transpiled.\
> A* `<div>`*, on the other hand, can be written as* `<div />`_or_`<div></div>`*.\
> The difference is that in the first syntax version there is no way to include anything in the* `<div />`_._

### Fix the errors in the code editor so that it is valid JSX and successfully transpiles. Make sure you don't change any of the content --- you only need to close tags where they are needed.

```
const JSX = (
  <div>
    <h2>Welcome to React!</h2> <br >
    <p>Be sure to close all tags!</p>
    <hr >
  </div>
);

```

### Ans:

```
const JSX = (
  <div>
    <h2>Welcome to React!</h2> <br />
    <p>Be sure to close all tags!</p>
    <hr />
  </div>
);

```

---

### React: Create a Stateless Functional Component

> _There are two ways to create a React component. The first way is to use a JavaScript function._

> _Defining a component in this way creates a stateless functional component._

> _think of a stateless component as one that can receive data and render it, but does not manage or track changes to that data._

#### To create a component with a function, you simply write a JavaScript function that returns either JSX or null

- React requires your function name to begin with a capital letter.

> _Here's an example of a stateless functional component that assigns an HTML class in JSX:_

```
// After being transpiled, the <div> will have a CSS class of 'customClass'
const DemoComponent = function() {
  return (
    <div className='customClass' />
  );
};

```

> _Because a JSX component represents HTML, you could put several components together to create a more complex HTML page._

### The code editor has a function called MyComponent. Complete this function so it returns a single div element which contains some string of text.

Note: The text is considered a child of the div element, so you will not be able to use a self-closing tag.

```
const MyComponent = function() {
  // Change code below this line

  // Change code above this line
}

```

### ANS:

```
const MyComponent = function() {
  // Change code below this line

return (
   <div> Some Text </div >
  );

  // Change code above this line
};

```

---

### React: Create a React Component

> _The other way to define a React component is with the ES6 class syntax. In the following example, Kitten extends React.Component:_

```
class Kitten extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <h1>Hi</h1>
    );
  }
}

```

> _This creates an ES6 class Kitten which extends the React.Component class._

> _So the Kitten class now has access to many useful React features, such as local state and lifecycle hooks._

> _Also notice the Kitten class has a constructor defined within it that calls super()_

> _It uses super() to call the constructor of the parent class, in this case React.Component_

> _The constructor is a special method used during the initialization of objects that are created with the class keyword. It is best practice to call a component's constructor with super, and pass props to both._

> _This makes sure the component is initialized properly. For now, know that it is standard for this code to be included._

### MyComponent is defined in the code editor using class syntax. Finish writing the render method so it returns a div element that contains an h1 with the text Hello React!.

```
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }
  render() {
    // Change code below this line

    // Change code above this line
  }
};

```

### ANS:

```
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }
  render() {
    // Change code below this line
 return (
   <div>
      <h1>Hello React!</h1>
      </div>
    );

    // Change code above this line
  }
};

```

---

### React: Create a Component with Composition

> _Imagine you are building an App and have created three components, a Navbar, Dashboard, and Footer._

> _To compose these components together, you could create an App parent component which renders each of these three components as children. To render a component as a child in a React component, you include the component name written as a custom HTML tag in the JSX._

- For example, in the render method you could write:

```
return (
 <App>
  <Navbar />
  <Dashboard />
  <Footer />
 </App>
)

```

> _When React encounters a custom HTML tag that references another component (a component name wrapped in < /> like in this example), it renders the markup for that component in the location of the tag. This should illustrate the parent/child relationship between the App component and the Navbar, Dashboard, and Footer._

### Challenge:

> _In the code editor, there is a simple functional component called ChildComponent and a class component called ParentComponent. Compose the two together by rendering the ChildComponent within the ParentComponent. Make sure to close the ChildComponent tag with a forward slash._

- Note:**ChildComponent is defined with an ES6 arrow function because this is a very common practice when using React**.
- However, know that this is just a function.

```
const ChildComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>I am the child</p>
    </div>
  );
};

class ParentComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>I am the parent</h1>
        { /* Change code below this line */ }

        { /* Change code above this line */ }
      </div>
    );
  }
};

```

⌛The React component should return a single div element.\
⌛The component should return two nested elements.\
⌛The component should return the ChildComponent as its second child.

### Ans:

```
const ChildComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>I am the child</p>
    </div>
  );
};

class ParentComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>I am the parent</h1>
        { /* Change code below this line */ }

        { /* Change code above this line */ }
      </div>
    );
  }
};

```

### Question

Write a function `rotateRight(array, num)` that takes in an array and a number as arguments.

> The function should return a new array where the elements of the array are rotated to the right number times.\
> The function should not mutate the original array and instead return a new array.

> Define this function using `function expression syntax`[.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/function)

**HINT:** you can use [Array#slice](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/slice) to create a copy of an array

---

> JavaScript gives us four methods to add or remove items from the beginning or end of arrays:

### pop(): Remove an item from the end of an array

```
let cats = ['Bob', 'Willy', 'Mini'];

cats.pop(); // ['Bob', 'Willy']

```

> pop() returns the removed item.

### push(): Add items to the end of an array

```
let cats = ['Bob'];

cats.push('Willy'); // ['Bob', 'Willy']

cats.push('Puff', 'George'); // ['Bob', 'Willy', 'Puff', 'George']

```

> push() returns the new array length.

### shift(): Remove an item from the beginning of an array

```
let cats = ['Bob', 'Willy', 'Mini'];

cats.shift(); // ['Willy', 'Mini']

```

> shift() returns the removed item.

### unshift(): Add items to the beginning of an array

```
let cats = ['Bob'];

cats.unshift('Willy'); // ['Willy', 'Bob']

cats.unshift('Puff', 'George'); // ['Puff', 'George', 'Willy', 'Bob']

```

> unshift() returns the new array length.

**We are being asked for two things:**

1.  To return an array with all the elements shifted over 'num' times.
2.  To `NOT` mutate the original array

**Step 1.**\
We need to start the function and create a variable to hold a COPY of our input array.

[**Array.prototype.slice()**\
*The slice() method returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array into a new array object selected from start to end...*developer.mozilla.org](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/slice "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/slice")[](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/slice)

- We assign array.slice(0) to a variable called result.
- Slicing our input array simply creates a sliced copy of the data.
- Remember that by excluding a second argument in our slice parameter allows us to slice from the first argument all the way to the end.

**Step 2.**\
We need to create a for loop to tell our function how many times we want to rotate.

- By setting our second delimiter to i < num we will ask our loops to run num times.
- Running num times is the same as executing the code block within num times.

**Step 3.**\
We need to put some executable code within our for loop to be run during every cycle.

- Since we are rotating to the right, every change to our result array under the hood will look like this (if we ref. our first test case):
- `['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'];` (how it looks like at the start)
- `['e', 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd'];` (after one run of the for loop)
- `['d', 'e', 'a', 'b', 'c'];` (after second/last run of the for loop)
- To accomplish this we first need to '`pop`' off or remove our last element.
- Two things happen when we use this built-in function.
- Our copied array is mutated to lose it's last ele.
- The removed element is stored in the variable we assigned to the function.
- Our second step is to add it to the start of our array, to do this we can use `unshift`.
- By inputting the variable we are using to hold our removed element into the parameter of unshift we are adding our element to the front of the array.

**Step 4.**

Now that our for loop has ended and our copied array looks just like how the answer looks, we need to output the answer.

- We accomplish this by creating a `return` line AFTER the for loop.

### Job Boards and The Hunt

I can't imagine the kind of masochism it would take to enjoy the act of posting and daily maintenance on a job board...It's part of the process that you've already invested so much of yourself in, so you should take pride in it; do a good job the first time around and you'll get where your going in the blink of an eye!

#### First off I am going to introduce a few different categories for those of you who are completely overwhelmed by the prospect of even selecting a job board let alone establishing a competitive presence on one. Here's a few catorizations I think are worth distinguishing for one and other.

### 1\. Interpersonal Connections

Seek to leverage the connections you have with people you know and companies you want to work with. I know that that's a violation of the premise of this article but without even feeling the need to provide quantitative proof; I can confidently assume that this is the most [RO](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/returnoninvestment.asp)I efficient way to produce a desirable result. (Sorry introverts... 2020 may have been your year but this is our world. 😘)

**If personal connections don't come through, the next best thing is cold outreach (_best in terms of results.... personally I hate cold calling strangers and I am an extrovert_.)**

1.  Before or after submitting an application, **identify 1--3 professionals to reach out to** at the company to express interest in opportunities.
2.  **Send a message to express interest and request an informational interview** with the individual via LinkedIn, email, Twitter, or other available communication methods.
3.  **If you hear back** and the individual is willing to connect, **confirm a day and time to conduct a preliminary interview.** *OR* **If you have yet to hear back after 3 business days, follow-up.**

Once you send off a message in step two, there are a variety of responses you may receive. Sometimes an individual will forward you along to someone who may be of better assistance, other times your message may be overlooked with no reply, and its possible (best case scenario) your request for a chat becomes an invitation to interview.

### **_2. LinkedIn_**.

I am going to devote a lot of time to this one because it is the largest and most active of all the job board ecosystems... period... full stop regardless of your industry.

LinkedIn now has [almost 740 million members](https://news.linkedin.com/about-us#Statistics) with over 55 million registered companies. (for comparison 12.3 million people visited Indeed in October, up 19.6 percent. [Monster.com](http://www.monster.com/) attracted 12.1 million people, and [CareerBuilder.com](http://www.careerbuilder.com/)attractedd 11.3 million in that same time) and LinkedIn is the most-used social media platform amongst Fortune 500 companies as it provides far more networking capabilities than pure recruitment.

If you put your resume and skills on LinkedIn.com as a software Engineer, and state that you are open to new opportunities, you *will* be contacted by multiple recruiters, and if your skills are desirable possibly also directly by companies seeking to hire you. It's a developer's market; there's not enough people out there, especially in America.

Here's my profile... feel free to connect... the larger your network the greater your exposure is to someone who works at your potential dream job.

Here's A Linkedin Checklist I will be using before I return to the job hunt!

[**LinkedIn**\
*Personal and Contact Information:*www.notion.so](https://www.notion.so/LinkedIn-d8b35e25ff0c451dbb5506ffa1179a8d "https://www.notion.so/LinkedIn-d8b35e25ff0c451dbb5506ffa1179a8d")[](https://www.notion.so/LinkedIn-d8b35e25ff0c451dbb5506ffa1179a8d)

> excerpt:

#### Experience Section

- [ ] I **have** listed all professional roles included on my resume in this section and any that I had to cut from my resume for space
- [ ] I **have** written 2--4 power statements for each experience listed (okay to copy and paste from resume)
- [ ] My power statements for each experience [are bulleted](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/update-how-add-bullet-points-your-linkedin-profile-erin-dore-miller/), not in paragraph form.
- [ ] I **did** list responsibilities in bullet point format (I **did not** leave in paragraph format)
- [ ] I **did** start each bullet point with [an action verb](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wZkDPBWtQZDGGdvStD61iRx_jOWVlIyyQl9UOYHtZgA/edit?usp=sharing) and I **did not** use phrases such as: `Assisted with...` `Worked on...` `Helped with...` (`Solely responsible for...` ok)
- [ ] I **did** describe past projects in past tense and current projects in present tense
- [ ] I **did not** use pronouns such as: "I," "we," "they, "you," "me," "us"
- [ ] **Optional:** Bootcamp student experience and projects can be listed under your experience section if you have no (or almost no) prior work experience.
- [ ] If I listed my Bootcamp student experience, my title is [name of program] Student (example: Data Science Student)
- [ ] I copied and pasted my Lambda projects in my student description and also included them in the Accomplishments section

### Do's:

**Spend a good portion of your time learning and reading. Your jobs teach you so much about an organization and the business.**

**Follow business owners and senior managers, successful team leaders in large organizations, startup owners. You would be surprised how willing some otherwise busy executives are to rub elbows with veritable newcomers. They're not just doing this out of the kindness of their hearts, just like you... they have an ulterior motive. They are hoping to build goodwill with the incoming workforce in a bid to make their company more attractive to high quality candidates. If they give you any of their time...treat it like an interview.**

> *To leverage this information, (the trick is to constantly remind yourself to be on your game with speaking with them.) I do not care what your teacher's past have said... mark my words...* **\*THERE IS MOST CERTAINLY SUCH A THING AS A STUPID QUESTION\*\***...Anyone who tells you otherwise is either stupid themselves or just overcome with their own compassion (an admirable trait but ultimately a disservice to you the competitive job seeker).\*

[**How to Ask Great Questions**\
*In Brief The Problem Some professionals such as litigators, journalists and even doctors, are taught to ask questions...*hbr.org](https://hbr.org/2018/05/the-surprising-power-of-questions "https://hbr.org/2018/05/the-surprising-power-of-questions")[](https://hbr.org/2018/05/the-surprising-power-of-questions)

> Engage in networking. I would recommend **finding and connecting with current attendee of any software development bootcamp**. They're all (for the most part) programatically encouraged to connect network and engage in peer skill promotion (even if they have no idea of you skill level). If that weren't enough reason, all of them come from a cohort of other individuals being instructed to do the same. Once you have a few in your network other's will seek you out through Linkedin recommendations algorithm.

> **Note to prospective employers please just skip the next few sentences and don't ask why...😅**

> **Of the 214 people that vouched for me... I guestimate about only 80 actually know me in any respectable capacity, and of those, only probably 30 or so are familiar with my competency in the skills they endorsed. It all boils down to the strategies that bootcamps instill in their students. It's the polar opposite of a zero sum game and they're more than happy to exchange personal recommendations with you. They're also far more driven to consistently engage with other members of the linkedin ecosystem because they need to a network to help compensate for their lack of a four year degree and the connections you make in that time.**

### Don't:

#### Don't Use LinkedIn's Default Headline

LinkedIn automatically populates your headline with your current job title and company name. I hope it goes without saying... but as a rule avoid signaling to prospective employers the depths of your laziness by using any stock responses LinkedIn provides you.

#### Don't Go Ham On Keyword Placment

Placing keywords strategically into your LinkedIn profile is virtually the only way to ensure being flagged by search algorithms as a potential candidate.You could be forgiven for being tempted to heed the advice of your inner lizard brain, and just stuffing your profile with buzzwords but this will likely trigger a spam account checker and result in worse outcomes than the absence of said keywords.

### Why it matters*¿*

#### Are We Really All Connected by Just Six Degrees of Separation?

Most of us are familiar with the concept of six degrees of separation --- the idea is that anyone in the planet can be connected to anyone else in just six steps. So through just five other people, you're effectively connected to the Queen of England, Jim Belushi or even yo mamma.

### Back to the other Job Board Niches:

**_3\. Traditional job boards_**. Dice.com, Monster.com, etc. They will not find you great jobs at technology companies; they may find you openings as a software engineer at other types of more traditional companies (for example, banks, retail chains, etc though.

**_4\. Local-focused sites_**. The biggest is Craigslist, but there are others. Often great for contract work and opportunities you wouldn't have otherwise come across.

**_5\. Freelancer websites_**. oDesk.com, Elance.com, etc. Lower pay, but 100% contract work, and has a lot of flexible opportunities if you're not looking for traditional full-time employment or remote work.

# Learn CSS So That Your Site Doesn't Look Like Garbage

CSS Selectors

---

### Learn CSS So That Your Site Doesn't Look Like Garbage

### CSS Selectors

- `CSS Selector` : Applies styles to a specific DOM element(s), there are various types:
- `Type Selectors` : Matches by node name.
- `Class Selectors` : Matches by class name.
- `ID Selectors` : Matches by ID name.
- `Universal Selectors` : Selects all HTML elements on a page.
- `Attribute Selectors` : Matches elements based on the prescence or value of a given attribute. (i.e. a[title] will match all a elements with a title attribute)

```
/* Type selector */
div {
  background-color: #000000;
}/* Class selector */
.active {
  color: #ffffff;
}/* ID selector */
#list-1 {
  border: 1px solid gray;
}/* Universal selector */
* {
  padding: 10px;
}/* Attribute selector */
a[title] {
  font-size: 2em;
}

```

**Class Selectors**

- Used to select all elements of a certain class denoted with a `.[class name]`
- You can assign multiple classes to a DOM element by separating them with a space.

**Compound Class Selectors**

- To get around accidentally selecting elements with multiple classes beyond what we want to grab we can chain dots.
- TO use a compound class selector just append the classes together when referencing them in the CSS.

```
<div class="box yellow"></div>
<div class="box orange"></div>
<div class="circle orange"></div>

```

- i.e. .box.yellow will select only the first element.
- KEEP IN MIND that if you do include a space it will make the selector into a *descendant selector*.

```
h1#heading,
h2.subheading {
  font-style: italic;
}

```

- When we want to target all `h1` tags with the id of `heading`.

**CSS Combinators**

- CSS Combinators are used to combine other selectors into more complex or targeted selectors --- they are very powerful!
- Be careful not to use too many of them as they will make your CSS far too complex.
- `Descendant Selectors`
- Separated by a space.
- Selects all descendants of a parent container.
- `Direct Child Selectors`
- Indicated with a `>`.
- Different from descendants because it only affects the direct children of an element.
- `.menu > .is-active { background-color: #ffe0b2; }`
- `<body> <div class="menu"> <div class="is-active">Belka</div> <div> <div class="is-active">Strelka</div> </div> </div> </body> <div class="is-active"> Laika </div> </body>`
- Belka would be the only element selected.
- `Adjacent Sibling Selectors`
- Uses the `+` symbol.
- Used for elements that directly follow one another and who both have the same parent.
- `h1 + h2 { font-style: italic; } <h1>Big header</h1> <h2>This one is styled because it is directly adjacent to the H1</h2> <h2>This one is NOT styled because there is no H1 right before it</h2>`

**Pseudo-Classes**

- `Pseudo-Class` : Specifies a special state of the seleted element(s) and does not refer to any elements or attributes contained in the DOM.
- Format is a `Selector:Pseudo-Class Name` or `A:B`
- `a:hover { font-family: "Roboto Condensed", sans-serif; color: #4fc3f7; text-decoration: none; border-bottom: 2px solid #4fc3f7; }`
- Some common pseudo-classes that are frequently used are:
- `active` : 'push down', when ele are activated.
- `checked` : applies to things like radio buttons or checkbox inputs.
- `disabled` : any disabled element.
- `first-child` : first element in a group of children/siblings.
- `focus` : elements that have current focus.
- `hover` : elements that have cursor hovering over it.
- `invalid` : any form elements in an invalid state from client-side form validation.
- `last-child` : last element in a group of children/siblings.
- `not(selector)` : elements that do not match the provided selector.
- `required` : form elements that are required.
- `valid` : form elements in a valid state.
- `visited` : anchor tags of whih the user has already been to the URL that the href points to.

`Pseudo-Selectors`

- Used to create pseudo-elements as children of the elements to which the property applies.
- `::after`
- `::before`

```
<style>
  p::before {
    background-color: lightblue;
    border-right: 4px solid violet;
    content: ":-) ";
    margin-right: 4px;
    padding-left: 4px;
  }
</style>
<p>This is the first paragraph</p>
<p>This is the second paragraph</p>
<p>This is the third paragraph</p>

```

- Will add some blue smiley faces before the p tag elements.

**CSS Rules**

- `CSS Rule` : Collection of single or compound selectors, a curly brace, zero or more properties
- `CSS Rule Specificity` : Sometimes CSS rules will contain multiple elements and may have overlapping properties rules for those same elements - there is an algorithm in CSS that calculates which rule takes precedence.
- `The Four Number Calculation` : listed in increasing order of importance.

Who has the most IDs? If no one, continue.

Who has the most classes? If no one, continue.

Who has the most tags? If no one, continue.

<style> .box { width: 50px; height: 50px; border: 1px solid black; } .orange { background-color: orange; } .yellow { background-color: yellow; border: 1px solid purple; } </style>

- Coming back to our example where all the CSS Rules have tied, the last step 4 wins out so our element will have a `purple border`.

**Typography**

- `font-family` : change the font.

- Remember that not all computers have the same fonts on them. - You can import web fonts via an api by using - `@import url('[https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Liu+Jian+Mao+Cao&display=swap');`](https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Liu+Jian+Mao+Cao&display=swap%27);`) and pasting it st the top of your CSS file. - And then reference it in your font-family. - `font-size` : Changes the size of your font. - Keep in mind the two kind of units CSS uses: - `Absolute` : `Pixels`, Points, Inches, Centimeters. - `Relative` : Em, Rem. - Em: Calulating the size relative to the previous div (bubbles down) - Rem: Calulates relative to the parent element always. - `font-style` : Used to set a font to italics. - `font-weight` : Used to make a font bold. - `text-align` : Used to align your text to the left, center, or right. - `text-decoration` : Use to put lines above, through, or under text. Lines can be solid, dashed, or wavy! - `text-transform` : Used to set text to all lowercase, uppercase, or capitalize all words.

**Background-Images**

- You can use the background-image property to set a background image for an element.

---

### CSS: Colors, Borders, and Shadows

**Colors**

- You can set colors in CSS in three popular ways: by name, by hexadecimal RGB value, and by their decimal RGB value.
- rgba() is used to make an rbg value more transparent, the `a` is used to specify the `alpha channel`.
- **Color** : Property used to change the color of text.
- **Background-Color** : Property to change the backgrounf color of an element.

**Borders**

- Borders take three values: The width of the border, the style (i.e. solid, dotted, dashed), color of the border.

**Shadows**

- There are two kinds of shadows in CSS: `box shadows` and `text shadows`.
- Box refers to HTML elements.
- Text refers to text.
- Shadows take values such as, the horizontal & vertical offsets of the shadow, the blur radius of the shadow, the spread radius, and of course the colors.

---

### The Box Model

**Box Model** : A concept that basically boils down that every DOM element has a box around it.

Imagine a gift, inside is the gift, wrapped in foam all around (padding), and the giftbox outside of it (border) and then a wrapping paper on the giftbox (margin).- For items that are using `block` as it's display, the browser will follow these rules to layout the element: - The box fills 100% of the available container space. - Every new box takes on a new line/row. - Width and Height properties are respected. - Padding, Margin, and Border will push other elements away from the box. - Certain elements have `block` as their default display, such as: divs, headers, and paragraphs.- For items that are using `inline` as it's display, the browser will follow these rules to layout the element: - Each box appears in a single line until it fills up the space. - Width and height are **not** respected. - Padding, Margin, and Border are applied but they **do not** push other elements away from the box. - Certain elements have `inline` as their default display, such as: span tags, anchors, and images.

**Standard Box Model vs Border-Box**- As per the standard Box Model, the width and height pertains to the content of the box and excludes any additional padding, borders, and margins.

This bothered many programmers so they created the **border box** to include the calculation of the entire box's height and width.

**Inline-Block**- Inline-block uses the best features of both `block` and `inline`. - Elements still get laid out left to right. - Layout takes into account specified width and height.

**Padding**- Padding applies padding to every side of a box. It is shorthand for four padding properties in this order: `padding-top`, `padding-right`, `padding-bottom`, `padding-left` (clockwise!)

**Border**- Border applies a border on all sides of an element. It takes three values in this order: `border-width`, `border-style`, `border-color`. - All three properties can be broken down in the four sides clockwise: top, right, bottom, left.

**Margin**- Margin sets margins on every side of an element. It takes four values in this order: `margin-top`, `margin-right`, `margin-bottom`, `margin-left`. - You can use `margin: 0 auto` to center an element.

### Positioning

- The `position` property allows us to set the position of elements on a page and is an integral part of creatnig a Web page layout.
- It accepts five values: `static`, `relative`, `absolute`, `fixed`, `sticky`.
- Every property (minus `static`) is used with: `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left` to position an element on a page.

**Static Positioning**

- The default position value of page elements.
- Most likely will not use static that much.

**Relative Positioning**

- Remains in it's original position in the page flow.
- It is positioned *RELATIVE* to the it's *ORIGINAL PLACE* on the page flow.
- Creates a **stacking context** : overlapping elements whose order can be set by the z-index property.

```
#pink-box {
  background-color: #ff69b4;
  bottom: 0;
  left: -20px;
  position: relative;
  right: 0;
  top: 0;
}

```

**Absolute Positioning**

- Absolute elements are removed from the normal page flow and other elements around it act like it's not there. (how we can easily achieve some layering)
- Here are some examples to illustration absolute positioning:

```
.container {
  background-color: #2b2d2f;
  position: relative;
}#pink-box {
  position: absolute;
  top: 60px;
}

- Note that the container ele has a relative positioning --- this is so that any changes made to the absolute positioned children will be positioned from it's top-left corner. - Note that because we removed the pink from the normal page flow, the container has now shifted the blue box to where the pink box should have been --- which is why it is now layered beneath the pink.

```
.container {
  background-color: #2b2d2f;

- If we removed the container's relative position. Our absolute unit would look for the nearest parent which would be the document itself.

**Fixed Positioning**

- Another positioning that removes it's element from the page flow, and automatically positions it's parent as the HTML doc itself.
- Fixed also uses top, right, bottom, and left.
- Useful for things like nav bars or other features we want to keep visible as the user scrolls.

**Sticky Positioning**

- Remains in it's original position in the page flow, and it is positioned relative to it's closest block-level ancestor and any *scrolling* ancestors.
- Behaves like a relatively positioned element until the point at which you would normally scroll past it's viewport --- then it sticks!
- It is positioned with top, right, bottom, and left.
- A good example are headers in a scrollable list.

### Flexible Box Model

- Flexbox is a **CSS module** that provides a convenient way for us to display items inside a flexible container so that the layout is responsive.
- Float was used back in the day to display position of elements in a container.
- A very inconvenient aspect of float is the need to *clear* the float.
- To 'clear' a float we need to set up a ghost div to properly align --- this is already sounds so inefficient.

**Using Flexbox**

- Flexbox automatically resizes a container element to fit the viewport size without needing to use breakpoints.

- Flexbox layout applies styles to the parent element, and it's children.

```
.container {
  display: flex; /*sets display to use flex*/
  flex-wrap: wrap; /*bc flex tries to fit everything into one line, use wrap to have the elements wrap to the next line*/
  flex-direction: row; /*lets us create either rows or columns*/
}

```

- `flex-flow` can be used to combine wrap and direction.
- `justify-content` used to define the alignment of flex items along the main axis.
- `align-items` used to define the alignment on the Y-axis.
- `align-content` redistributes extra space on the cross axis.
- By default, flex items will appear in the order they are added to the DOM, but we can use the `order` property to change that.
- Some other properties we can use on flex items are:
- `flex-grow` : dictates amount of avail. space the item should take up.
- `flex-shrink` : defines the ability for a flex item to shrink.
- `flex-basis` : Default size of an element before the remaining space is distributed.
- `flex` : shorthand for grow, shrink and basis.
- `align-self` : Overrides default alignment in the container.

---

### Grid Layout

- CSS Grid is a 2d layout system that let's use create a grid with columns and rows purely using Vanilla CSS. (flex is one dimensional)

**Bootstrap vs CSS Grid**

- Bootstrap was a front-end library commonly used to create grid layouts but now CSS grid provides greater flexibility and control.
- Grid applies style to a parent container and it's child elements.

```
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  grid-template-rows: auto;
  grid-template-areas:
    "header header header"
    "main . sidebar"
    "footer footer footer";  grid-column-gap: 20px;
  grid-row-gap: 30px;
  justify-items: stretch;
  align-items: stretch;
  justify-content: stretch;
  align-content: stretch;
}.item-1 {
  grid-area: header;
}
.item-2 {
  grid-area: main;
}
.item-3 {
  grid-area: sidebar;
}
.item-4 {
  grid-area: footer;
}

```

- Columns and Rows can be defined with: pixels, percentages, auto, named grid lines, using `repeat`, fractions.
- `Grid Template Areas` gives us a handy way to map out and visualize areas of the grid layout.
- Combine areas with templates to define how much space an area should take up.
- `Grid Gaps` can be used to create 'gutters' between grid item.s
- The way we have defined our grid with `grid-templates` and `areas` are considered **explicit**.
- We can also `implicitly` define grids.

```
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 100px 100px 100px 100px;
  grid-template-rows: 50px 50px 50px;
  grid-auto-columns: 100px;
  grid-auto-rows: 50px;
}

```

- Any grid items that aren't explicity placed are automatically placed or *re-flowed*

**Spanning Columns & Rows**

- We can use the following properties to take up a specified num of cols and rows.
- `grid-column-start`
- `grid-column-end`
- `grid-row-start`
- `grid-row-end`
- All four properties can take any of the following values: the line number, span #, span name, auto.

```
.item-1 {
  grid-row-start: row2-start; /* Item starts at row line named "row2-start" */
  grid-row-end: 5; /* Item ends at row line 5 */
  grid-column-start: 1; /* Item starts at column line 1 */
  grid-column-end: three; /* Item ends at column line named "three" */
}.item-2 {
  grid-row-start: 1; /* Item starts at row line 1 */
  grid-row-end: span 2; /* Item spans two rows and ends at row line 3 */
  grid-column-start: 3; /* Item starts at column line 3 */
  grid-column-end: span col5-start; /* Item spans and ends at line named "col5-start" */
}

```

**Grid Areas**

- We use the grid areas in conjunction with grid-container property to **define sections of the layout**.
- We can then assign named sections to individual element's css rules.

**Justify & Align Self**

- Justify items and Align Items can be used to align all grid items at once.
- **Justify Self** is used to align self on the row.
- It can take four values: start, end, center, stretch.
- **Align Self** is used to align self on the column.
- It can take four values: start, end, center, stretch.

---

**CSS Hover Effect and Handling**

**Overflow**

`css .btn { background-color: #00bfff; color: #ffffff; border-radius: 10px; padding: 1.5rem; }`

`.btn--active:hover { cursor: pointer; transform: translateY(-0.25rem);`

`/* Moves our button up/down on the Y axis */ }`

The Pseudo Class Selector `hover` activates when the cursor goes over the selected element.

**Content Overflow**- You can apply an `overflow` content property to an element if it's inner contents are spilling over.

There are three members in the overflow family: --- `overflow-x` : Apply horizontally. - `overflow-y` : Apply vertically. - `overflow` : Apply both directions.

### Transitions

- Transitions provide a way to control animation speed when changing CSS properties.
- **Implicit Transitions** : Animations that involve transitioning between two states.

**Defining Transitions**

- `transition-property` : specifies the name of the CSS property to apply the transition.
- `transition-duration` : during of the transition.
- `transition-delay` : time before the transition should start.

**Examples** :

```
#delay {
  font-size: 14px;
  transition-property: font-size;
  transition-duration: 4s;
  transition-delay: 2s;
}#delay:hover {
  font-size: 36px;
}

```

- After a delay of two seconds, a four second transition begins where the font size goes from 36px to 14px.

```
.box {
  border-style: solid;
  border-width: 1px;
  display: block;
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: #0000ff;
  transition: width 2s, height 2s, background-color 2s, transform 2s;
}.box:hover {
  background-color: #ffcccc;
  width: 200px;
  height: 200px;
  transform: rotate(180deg);
}

```

- When the mouse hovers over a box, it spins due to the rotate transform. Width and height change and also the bg color.

### BEM Guidelines

- BEM was created as a guideline to solve the issue of loose standards around CSS naming conventions.
- **BEM** stands for `block`, `element`, `modifier`.
- **Block**
- A standalone entity that is meaningful on it's own.
- Can be nested and interact with one another.
- Holistic entities without DOM rep can be blocks.
- May consist latin letters, digits, and dashes.
- Any DOM node can be a block if it accepts a class name.
- **Element**
- Part of a block and has no standalone meaning.
- Any element that is semantically tied to a block.
- May consist latin letters, digits, and dashes.
- Formed by using two underscores after it's block name.
- Any DOM node within a block can be an element.
- Element classes should be used independently.
- **Modifier**
- A flag on blocks or elements. Use them to change appearance, behavior or state.
- Extra class name to add onto blocks or elements.
- Add mods only to the elements they modify.
- Modifier names may consist of Latin letters, digits, dashes and underscores.
- Written with two dashes.

**BEM Example**

```
<form class="form form--theme-xmas form--simple">
  <input class="form__input" type="text" />
  <input class="form__submit form__submit--disabled" type="submit" />
</form>/* block selector */
.form {
}/* block modifier selector */
.form--theme-xmas {
}/* block modifier selector */
.form--simple {
}/* element selector */
.form__input {
}/* element selector */
.form__submit {
}/* element modifier selector */
.form__submit--disabled {
}

```

# LocalStorage VS SessionStorage

Web storage objects localStorage and sessionStorage allow to save key/value pairs in the browser.

### LocalStorage VS SessionStorage

Web storage objects `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` allow to save key/value pairs in the browser.

What's interesting about them is that the data survives a page refresh (for `sessionStorage`) and even a full browser restart (for `localStorage`). We'll see that very soon.

We already have cookies. Why additional objects?

- Unlike cookies, web storage objects are not sent to server with each request. Because of that, we can store much more. Most browsers allow at least 2 megabytes of data (or more) and have settings to configure that.
- Also unlike cookies, the server can't manipulate storage objects via HTTP headers. Everything's done in JavaScript.
- The storage is bound to the origin (domain/protocol/port triplet). That is, different protocols or subdomains infer different storage objects, they can't access data from each other.

Both storage objects provide same methods and properties:

- `setItem(key, value)` -- store key/value pair.
- `getItem(key)` -- get the value by key.
- `removeItem(key)` -- remove the key with its value.
- `clear()` -- delete everything.
- `key(index)` -- get the key on a given position.
- `length` -- the number of stored items.

As you can see, it's like a `Map` collection (`setItem/getItem/removeItem`), but also allows access by index with `key(index)`.

Let's see how it works.

### localStorage demo

The main features of `localStorage` are:

- Shared between all tabs and windows from the same origin.
- The data does not expire. It remains after the browser restart and even OS reboot.

For instance, if you run this code...

```
localStorage.setItem('test', 1);

```

...And close/open the browser or just open the same page in a different window, then you can get it like this:

```
alert( localStorage.getItem('test') ); // 1

```

We only have to be on the same origin (domain/port/protocol), the url path can be different.

The `localStorage` is shared between all windows with the same origin, so if we set the data in one window, the change becomes visible in another one.

### Object-like access

We can also use a plain object way of getting/setting keys, like this:

```
// set key
localStorage.test = 2;

// get key
alert( localStorage.test ); // 2

// remove key
delete localStorage.test;

```

That's allowed for historical reasons, and mostly works, but generally not recommended, because:

1.  If the key is user-generated, it can be anything, like `length` or `toString`, or another built-in method of `localStorage`. In that case `getItem/setItem` work fine, while object-like access fails:

```
let key = 'length'; localStorage[key] = 5; // Error, can't assign length

```

1.  There's a `storage` event, it triggers when we modify the data. That event does not happen for object-like access. We'll see that later in this chapter.

### Looping over keys

As we've seen, the methods provide "get/set/remove by key" functionality. But how to get all saved values or keys?

Unfortunately, storage objects are not iterable.

One way is to loop over them as over an array:

```
for(let i=0; i<localStorage.length; i++) {
  let key = localStorage.key(i);
  alert(`${key}: ${localStorage.getItem(key)}`);
}

```

Another way is to use `for key in localStorage` loop, just as we do with regular objects.

It iterates over keys, but also outputs few built-in fields that we don't need:

```
// bad try
for(let key in localStorage) {
  alert(key); // shows getItem, setItem and other built-in stuff
}

```

...So we need either to filter fields from the prototype with `hasOwnProperty` check:

```
for(let key in localStorage) {
  if (!localStorage.hasOwnProperty(key)) {
    continue; // skip keys like "setItem", "getItem" etc
  }
  alert(`${key}: ${localStorage.getItem(key)}`);
}

```

...Or just get the "own" keys with `Object.keys` and then loop over them if needed:

```
let keys = Object.keys(localStorage);
for(let key of keys) {
  alert(`${key}: ${localStorage.getItem(key)}`);
}

```

The latter works, because `Object.keys` only returns the keys that belong to the object, ignoring the prototype.

### Strings only

Please note that both key and value must be strings.

If were any other type, like a number, or an object, it gets converted to string automatically:

```
sessionStorage.user = {name: "John"};
alert(sessionStorage.user); // [object Object]

```

We can use `JSON` to store objects though:

```
sessionStorage.user = JSON.stringify({name: "John"});

// sometime later
let user = JSON.parse( sessionStorage.user );
alert( user.name ); // John

```

Also it is possible to stringify the whole storage object, e.g. for debugging purposes:

```
// added formatting options to JSON.stringify to make the object look nicer
alert( JSON.stringify(localStorage, null, 2) );

```

### sessionStorage

The `sessionStorage` object is used much less often than `localStorage`.

Properties and methods are the same, but it's much more limited:

- The `sessionStorage` exists only within the current browser tab.
- Another tab with the same page will have a different storage.
- But it is shared between iframes in the same tab (assuming they come from the same origin).
- The data survives page refresh, but not closing/opening the tab.

Let's see that in action.

Run this code...

```
sessionStorage.setItem('test', 1);

```

...Then refresh the page. Now you can still get the data:

```
alert( sessionStorage.getItem('test') ); // after refresh: 1

```

...But if you open the same page in another tab, and try again there, the code above returns `null`, meaning "nothing found".

That's exactly because `sessionStorage` is bound not only to the origin, but also to the browser tab. For that reason, `sessionStorage` is used sparingly.

### Storage event

When the data gets updated in `localStorage` or `sessionStorage`, [storage](https://www.w3.org/TR/webstorage/#the-storage-event) event triggers, with properties:

- `key` -- the key that was changed (`null` if `.clear()` is called).
- `oldValue` -- the old value (`null` if the key is newly added).
- `newValue` -- the new value (`null` if the key is removed).
- `url` -- the url of the document where the update happened.
- `storageArea` -- either `localStorage` or `sessionStorage` object where the update happened.

The important thing is: the event triggers on all `window` objects where the storage is accessible, except the one that caused it.

Let's elaborate.

Imagine, you have two windows with the same site in each. So `localStorage` is shared between them.

```
You might want to open this page in two browser windows to test the code below.

```

If both windows are listening for `window.onstorage`, then each one will react on updates that happened in the other one.

```
// triggers on updates made to the same storage from other documents
window.onstorage = event => { // same as window.addEventListener('storage', event => {
  if (event.key != 'now') return;
  alert(event.key + ':' + event.newValue + " at " + event.url);
};

localStorage.setItem('now', Date.now());

```

Please note that the event also contains: `event.url` -- the url of the document where the data was updated.

Also, `event.storageArea` contains the storage object -- the event is the same for both `sessionStorage` and `localStorage`, so `event.storageArea` references the one that was modified. We may even want to set something back in it, to "respond" to a change.

**That allows different windows from the same origin to exchange messages.**

Modern browsers also support Broadcast channel API, the special API for same-origin inter-window communication, it's more full featured, but less supported. The

| | #################################################### |
| | |
| | # You have numbers |
| | 3 # => 3 |
| | |
| | # Math is what you would expect |
| | 1 + 1 # => 2 |
| | 8 - 1 # => 7 |
| | 10 _ 2 # => 20 |
| | 35 / 5 # => 7.0 |

| | -5 // 3 # => -2 |
| | 5.0 // 3.0 # => 1.0 # works on floats too |
| | -5.0 // 3.0 # => -2.0 |
| | |
| | # The result of division is always a float |
| | 10.0 / 3 # => 3.3333333333333335 |
| | |
| | # Modulo operation |
| | 7 % 3 # => 1 |
| | |
| | # Exponentiation (x**y, x to the yth power) |
| | 2**3 # => 8 |
| | |
| | # Enforce precedence with parentheses |
| | (1 + 3) _ 2 # => 8 |
| | |
| | # Boolean values are primitives (Note: the capitalization) |
| | True |
| | False |
| | |
| | # negate with not |
| | not True # => False |
| | not False # => True |
| | |
| | # Boolean Operators |
| | # Note "and" and "or" are case-sensitive |
| | True and False # => False |
| | False or True # => True |
| | |
| | # True and False are actually 1 and 0 but with different keywords |
| | True + True # => 2 |
| | True * 8 # => 8 |
| | False - 5 # => -5 |
| | |
| | # Comparison operators look at the numerical value of True and False |
| | 0 == False # => True |
| | 1 == True # => True |
| | 2 == True # => False |
| | -5 != False # => True |
| | |
| | # Using boolean logical operators on ints casts them to booleans for evaluation, but their non-cast value is returned |
| | # Don't mix up with bool(ints) and bitwise and/or (&,|) |
| | bool(0) # => False |
| | bool(4) # => True |
| | bool(-6) # => True |
| | 0 and 2 # => 0 |
| | -5 or 0 # => -5 |
| | |
| | # Equality is == |
| | 1 == 1 # => True |
| | 2 == 1 # => False |
| | |
| | # Inequality is != |
| | 1 != 1 # => False |
| | 2 != 1 # => True |

| | # Seeing whether a value is in a range |
| | 1 < 2 and 2 < 3 # => True |
| | 2 < 3 and 3 < 2 # => False |
| | # Chaining makes this look nicer |
| | 1 < 2 < 3 # => True |
| | 2 < 3 < 2 # => False |
| | |
| | # (is vs. ==) is checks if two variables refer to the same object, but == checks |
| | # if the objects pointed to have the same values. |
| | a = [1, 2, 3, 4] # Point a at a new list, [1, 2, 3, 4] |

| | # Strings are created with " or ' |
| | "This is a string." |
| | 'This is also a string.' |
| | |
| | # Strings can be added too! But try not to do this. |
| | "Hello " + "world!" # => "Hello world!" |
| | # String literals (but not variables) can be concatenated without using '+' |
| | "Hello " "world!" # => "Hello world!" |
| | |
| | # A string can be treated like a list of characters |
| | "This is a string"[0] # => 'T' |
| | |
| | # You can find the length of a string |
| | len("This is a string") # => 16 |
| | |
| | # .format can be used to format strings, like this: |
| | "{} can be {}".format("Strings", "interpolated") # => "Strings can be interpolated" |
| | |
| | # You can repeat the formatting arguments to save some typing. |
| | "{0} be nimble, {0} be quick, {0} jump over the {1}".format("Jack", "candle stick") |
| | # => "Jack be nimble, Jack be quick, Jack jump over the candle stick" |
| | |
| | # You can use keywords if you don't want to count. |
| | "{name} wants to eat {food}".format(name="Bob", food="lasagna") # => "Bob wants to eat lasagna" |
| | |
| | # If your Python 3 code also needs to run on Python 2.5 and below, you can also |
| | # still use the old style of formatting: |
| | "%s can be %s the %s way" % ("Strings", "interpolated", "old") # => "Strings can be interpolated the old way" |
| | |
| | # You can also format using f-strings or formatted string literals (in Python 3.6+) |
| | name = "Reiko" |
| | f"She said her name is {name}." # => "She said her name is Reiko" |
| | # You can basically put any Python statement inside the braces and it will be output in the string. |
| | f"{name} is {len(name)} characters long." # => "Reiko is 5 characters long." |
| | |
| | |
| | # None is an object |
| | None # => None |
| | |
| | # Don't use the equality "==" symbol to compare objects to None |
| | # Use "is" instead. This checks for equality of object identity. |
| | "etc" is None # => False |
| | None is None # => True |
| | |
| | # None, 0, and empty strings/lists/dicts/tuples all evaluate to False. |
| | # All other values are True |
| | bool(0) # => False |
| | bool("") # => False |
| | bool([]) # => False |
| | bool({}) # => False |

| | |
| | # Python modules are just ordinary Python files. You |

| | # If you have a Python script named math.py in the same |

| | ## 6.1 Inheritance |
| | #################################################### |
| | |
| | # Inheritance allows new child classes to be defined that inherit methods and |
| | # variables from their parent class. |
| | |
| | # Using the Human class defined above as the base or parent class, we can |
| | # define a child class, Superhero, which inherits the class variables like |
| | # "species", "name", and "age", as well as methods, like "sing" and "grunt" |
| | # from the Human class, but can also have its own unique properties. |
| | |
| | # To take advantage of modularization by file you could place the classes above in their own files, |
| | # say, human.py |
| | |
| | # To import functions from other files use the following format |
| | # from "filename-without-extension" import "function-or-class" |
| | |
| | from human import Human |
| | |
| | |
| | # Specify the parent class(es) as parameters to the class definition |
| | class Superhero(Human): |
| | |
| | # If the child class should inherit all of the parent's definitions without |
| | # any modifications, you can just use the "pass" keyword (and nothing else) |
| | # but in this case it is commented out to allow for a unique child class: |
| | # pass |
| | |
| | # Child classes can override their parents' attributes |
| | species = 'Superhuman' |
| | |
| | # Children automatically inherit their parent class's constructor including |
| | # its arguments, but can also define additional arguments or definitions |
| | # and override its methods such as the class constructor. |
| | # This constructor inherits the "name" argument from the "Human" class and |
| | # adds the "superpower" and "movie" arguments: |
| | def **init**(self, name, movie=False, |
| | superpowers=["super strength", "bulletproofing"]): |
| | |
| | # add additional class attributes: |
| | self.fictional = True |
| | self.movie = movie |
| | # be aware of mutable default values, since defaults are shared |
| | self.superpowers = superpowers |
| | |
| | # The "super" function lets you access the parent class's methods |
| | # that are overridden by the child, in this case, the **init** method. |
| | # This calls the parent class constructor: |
| | super().**init**(name) |
| | |
| | # override the sing method |
| | def sing(self): |
| | return 'Dun, dun, DUN!' |
